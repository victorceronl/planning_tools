FAQ —DOUBTERS READ THIS  
T  JLs lifestyle design for you? Chances are good that it is. Here are  some of the most common doubts and fears that people have before  taking the leap and joining the New Rich:  Do I have to quit my job? Do I have to be a risk-taker?  No on both counts. From using Jedi mind tricks to disappear from  the office to designing businesses that finance your lifestyle, there  are paths for every comfort level. How does a Fortune 500 employee  explore the hidden jewels of China for a month and use technology  to cover his tracks? How do you create a hands-off business that  generates $8oK per month with no management? It's all here.  Do I have to be a single twenty-something?  Not at all. This book is for anyone who is sick of the deferred-life  plan and wants to live life large instead of postpone it. Case studies  range from a Lamborghini-driving 21-year-old to a single mother  who traveled the world for five months with her two children. If  you're sick of the standard menu of options and prepared to enter a  world of infinite options, this book is for you.  Do I have to travel? I just want more time.  No. It's just one option. The objective is to create freedom of time  and place and use both however you want.  ======================================== [Página 16] ======================================== 4 FIRST AND FOREMOST  Do I need to be born rich?  No. My parents have never made more than $50,000 per year  combined, and I've worked since age 14. I'm no Rockefeller and you  needn't be either.  Do I need to be an Ivy League graduate?  Nope. Most of the role models in this book didn't go to the Har- vards of the world, and some are dropouts. Top academic institutions  are wonderful, but there are unrecognized benefits to not coming out  of one. Grads from top schools are funneled into high-income 80- hour-per-week jobs, and 15-30 years of soul-crushing work has been  accepted as the default path. How do I know? I've been there and seen  the destruction. This book reverses it.  ======================================== [Página 17] ======================================== -MY STORY AND WHY YOU NEED THIS BOOK   Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is  time to pause and reflect. —MARK TWAIN  Anyone who lives within their means suffers from a lack of  imagination.  —OSCAR WILDE, Irish dramatist and novelist  M y hands were sweating again.  Staring down at the floor to avoid the blinding ceiling lights, I was  supposedly one of the best in the world, but it just didn't register. My  partner Alicia shifted from foot to foot as we stood in line with nine other  couples, all chosen from over 1,000 competitors from 29 countries and four  continents. It was the last day of the Tango World Championship  semifinals, and this was our final run in front of the judges, television  cameras, and cheering crowds. The other couples had an average of 15 years  together. For us, it was the culmination of 5 months of nonstop 6-hour  practices, and finally, it was showtime.  "How are you doing?" Alicia, a seasoned professional dancer, asked me  in her distinctly Argentine Spanish.  "Fantastic. Awesome. Let's just enjoy the music. Forget the crowd— they're not even here."  That wasn't entirely true. It was hard to even fathom 50,000 spectators  and coordinators in El Rural, even if it was the biggest exhibition hall in  Buenos Aires. Through the thick haze of cigarette smoke, you could barely  make out the huge undulating mass in the stands, and everywhere there was  exposed floor, except the sacred  ======================================== [Página 18] ======================================== 6 FIRST AND FOREMOST  30' x 40' space in the middle of it all. I adjusted my pin-striped suit  and fussed with my blue silk handkerchief until it was obvious that I  was just fidgeting.  "Are you nervous?"  "I'm not nervous. I'm excited. I'm just going to have fun and let  the rest follow."  "Number 152, you're up." Our chaperone had done his job, and  now it was our turn. I whispered an inside joke to Alicia as we  stepped on the hardwood platform: "Tranquilo"—Take it easy. She  laughed, and at just that moment, I thought to myself, "What on earth  would I be doing right now, if I hadn't left my job and the United  States over a year ago?"  The thought vanished as quickly as it had appeared when the an- nouncer came  over the loudspeaker and the crowd erupted to matc h  him: "Pareja numero 152, Timothy Ferriss y Alicia Monti, Ciudad de  Buenos Aires!!!"  We were on, and I was beaming.  THE MOST FUNDA MENTAL of American questions is hard for me to  answer these days, and luckily so. If it weren't, you wouldn't be  holding this book in your hands.  "So, what do you do?"  Assuming you can find me (hard to do), and depending on when  you ask me (I'd prefer you didn't), I could be racing motorcycles in  Europe, scuba diving off a private island in Panama, resting under a  palm tree between kickboxing sessions in Thailand, or dancing tango  in Buenos Aires. The beauty is, I'm not a multimillionaire, nor do I  particularly care to be.  I never enjoyed answering this cocktail question because it reflects  an epidemic I was long part of: job descriptions as self-descriptions.  If someone asks me now and is anything but absolutely sincere, I  explain my lifestyle of mysterious means simply.  "I'm a drug dealer."  ======================================== [Página 19] ======================================== My Story and Why You Need This Book   7  Pretty much a conversation ender. It's only half true, besides. The  whole truth would take too long. How can I possibly explain that  what I do with my time and what I do for money are completely  different things? That I work less than four hours per week and make  more per month than I used to make in a year?  For the first time, I'm going to tell you the real story. It involves a  quiet subculture of people called the "New Rich."  What does an igloo-dwelling millionaire do that a cubicle-dweller  doesn't? Follow an uncommon set of rules.  How does a lifelong blue-chip employee escape to travel the  world for a month without his boss even noticing? He uses tech- nology to hide the fact.  Gold is getting old. The New Rich (NR) are those who abandon  the deferred-life plan and create luxury lifestyles in the present using  the currency of the New Rich: time and mobility. This is an art and a  science we will refer to as Lifestyle Design (LD).  I've spent the last three years traveling among those who live in  worlds currently beyond your imagination. Rather than hating reality,  I'll show you how to bend it to your will. It's easier than it sounds.  My journey from grossly overworked and severely underpaid office  worker to member of the NR is at once stranger than fiction and—  now that I've deciphered the code—simple to duplicate. There is a  recipe.  Life doesn't have to be so damn hard. It really doesn't. Most peo- ple, my past self included, have spent too much time convincing  themselves that life has to be hard, a resignation to 9-10-5 drudgery  in exchange for (sometimes) relaxing weekends and the occasional  keep -it-short-or-get-fired vacation.  The truth, at least the truth I live and will share in this book, is  quite different. From leveraging currency differences to outsourcing  your life and disappearing, I'll show you how a small underground  uses economic sleight-of-hand to do what most consider impossible.  ======================================== [Página 20] ======================================== 8 FIRST AND FOREMOST  If you've picked up this book, chances are that you don't want to  sit behind a desk until you are 62. Whether your dream is escaping  the rat race, real-life fantasy travel, long-term wandering, setting  world records, or simply a dramat ic career change, this book will  give you all the tools you need to make it a reality in the here-and- now instead of in the often elusive "retirement." There is a way to get  the rewards for a life of hard work without waiting until the end.  How? It begins with a simple distinction most people miss—one I  missed for 25 years.  People don't want to be millionaires—they want to experience  what they believe only millions can buy. Ski chalets, butlers, and ex- otic travel often enter the picture. Perhaps rubbing cocoa butter on  your belly in a hamm ock while you listen to waves rhythmically lap- ping against the deck of your thatched-roof bungalow? Sounds nice.  $1,000,00 0 in the bank isn't the fantasy. The fantasy is the life- style of complete freedom it supposedly allows. The question is then,  How can one achieve the millionaire lifestyle of complete freedom  withoutfirst having $1,000,000?   In the last five years, I have answered this question for myself,  and this book will answer it for you. I will show you exactly how I  have separated income from time and created my ideal lifestyle in the  process, traveling the world and enjoying the best this planet has to  offer. How on earth did I go from 14-hour days and $40,000  per year  to 4-hour weeks and $40,000 per month?  It helps to know where it all started. Strangely enough, it was in a  class of soon-to-be investment bankers.  In 2002,1  was asked by Ed Zschau, ubermentor and my former  professor of High-tech Entrepreneurship at Princeton University, to  come back and speak to the same class about my business adventures  in the real world. I was stuck. There were already decam illion-aires  speaking to the same class, and even though I had built a highly  profitable sports suppleme nt company, I marched to a distinctly dif- ferent drumme r.  ======================================== [Página 21] ======================================== My Story and Why You Need This Book   9  Over the ensuing days, however, I realized that everyone seeme d  to be discussing how to build large and successful companies, sell  out, and live the good life. Fair enough. The question no one really  seeme d to be asking or answering was, Why do it all in the first  place? What is the pot of gold that justifies spending the best years of  your life hoping for happiness in the last?  The lectures I ultimate ly developed, titled "Drug Dealing for Fun  and Profit," began with a simple premise: Test the most basic  assumptions of the work-life equation.  •-How do your decisions change if retirement isn't an option? •- What if you could use a mini-retirement to sample your  deferred-life plan reward before working 40 years for it? «~Is it  really necessary to work like a slave to live like a  millionaire?  Little did I know where questions like these would take me.  The uncommon conclusion? The commonsense rules of the "real  world" are a fragile collection of socially reinforced illusions. This  book will teach you how to see and seize the options others do not.  What makes this book different?  First, I'm not going to spend much time on the problem. I'm going  to assume you are suffering from time famine, creeping dread, or—  worst case—a tolerable and comfortable existence doing something  unfulfilling. The last is most common and most insidious.  Second, this book is not about saving and will not recomme nd  you abandon your daily glass of red wine for a million dollars 50  years from now. I'd rather have the wine. I won't ask you to choose  between enjoyment today or money later. I believe you can have  both now. The goal is fun and profit.  Third, this book is not about finding your "dream job." I will take  as a given that, for most people, somewhere between six and seven  billion of them, the perfect job is the one that takes the least time.  The vast majority of people will never find a job that can be an  ======================================== [Página 22] ======================================== 10 FIRST AND FOREMOST  unending source of fulfillment, so that is not the goal here; to free  time and automate income is.  I OPEN EACH class with an explanation of the singular importance of  being a "dealmaker." The manifesto of the dealmaker is simple:  Reality is negotiable. Outside of science and law, all rules can be  bent or broken, and it doesn't require being unethical.  The DEAL of deal making is also an acronym for the process of  becoming a member of the New Rich.  The steps and strategies can be used with incredible results—  whether you are an employee or an entrepreneur. Can you do every- thing I've done with a boss? No. Can you use the same principles to  double your income, cut your hours in half, or at least double the  usual vacation time? Most definitely.  Here is the step-by-step process you'll use to reinvent yourself:  D for Definition turns misguided common sense upside down and  introduces the rules and objectives of the new game. It replaces  self-defeating assumptions and explains concepts such as relative  wealth and eustress.1 Who are the NR and how do they operate?  This section explains the overall lifestyle design recipe—the  fundamentals—before we add the three ingredients.  E for Elimination kills the obsolete notion of time management once  and for all. It shows exactly how I used the words of an often- forgotten Italian economist to turn 12-hour days into two-hour  days ... in 48 hours. Increase your per-hour results ten times or  more with counterintuitive NR techniques for cultivating  selective ignorance, developing a low-information diet,  1. Uncommon terms are defined throughout this book as concepts are introduced. If  something is unclear or you need a quick reference, please visit  www .fourhourworkweek.com for an extensive glossary and other resources.  ======================================== [Página 23] ======================================== My Story and Why You Need This Book 11  and otherwise ignoring the unimportant. This section provides the  first of the three luxury lifestyle design ingredients: time.   A for Automation puts cash flow on autopilot using geographic  arbitrage, outsourcing, and rules of nondecision. From bracketing  to the routines of ultrasuccessful NR, it's all here. This section  provides the second ingredient of luxury lifestyle design: income.  L for Liberation is the mobile manifesto for the globally inclined.  The concept of mini-retirements is introduced, as are the means  for flawless remote control and escaping the boss. Liberation is  not about cheap travel; it is about forever breaking the bonds that  confine you to a single location. This section delivers the third  and final ingredient for luxury lifestyle design: mobility.  I should note that most bosses are less than pleased if you spend  one hour in the office each day, and employees should therefore read  the steps in the entrepreneurially minded DEAL order but implement  them as DEL A. If you decide to remain in your current job, it is  necessary to create freedom of location before you cut your work  hours by 80%. Even if you have never considered becoming an en- trepreneur in the modern sense, the DEAL process will turn you into  an entrepreneur in the purer sense as first coined by French  economist }. B. Say in 1800 —on e who shifts economic resources out  of an area of lower and into an area of higher yield.2  Last but not least, much of what I recomme nd will seem impos- sible and even offensive to basic common sense—I expect that. Re- solve now to test the concepts as an exercise in lateral thinking. If  you try it, you'll see just how deep the rabbit hole goes, and you won't  ever go back.  2. http://www.peter-drucker.com/books/0088730618 7.html.  ======================================== [Página 24] ======================================== 12 FIRST AND FOREMOST  Take a deep breath and let me show you my world. And remem- ber—tranquilo. It's time to have fun and let the rest follow.  TIM FERRISS  Tokyo, Japan  September 29,2006   ======================================== [Página 25] ======================================== -CHRONOLOGY OF A PATHOLOGY   An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes that  can be made in a very narrow field.  —NIELS BOHR , Danish physicist and Nobel Prize winner  Ordinarily he was insane, but he had lucid moments when  he was merely stupid.  —HEINRICH HEINE, German critic and poet  T  JLhis book will teach you the precise principles I have used to become  the following:  "-No-holds-barred cage fighter, vanquisher of four world  champions "-First American in history to hold a Guinness world  record  in tango •-Princeton University guest lecturer in entrepreneurship  •-Applied linguist in Japanese, Chinese, German, and  Spanish -Glycemic Index researcher ■- National Chinese kickboxing champion — MTV break-dancer in Taiwan  •-Athletic adviser to more than 30 world record holders - Actor on hit TV series in China and Hong Kong •-TV host in  Thailand and China •-Political asylum researcher and activist  •-Shark diver -Motorcycle racer  How I got to this point is a tad less glamorous:  ======================================== [Página 26] ======================================== 14 FIRST AND FOREMOST  1977  Born 6 weeks premat ure and given a io% chance of living. I  survive instead and grow so fat that I can't roll onto my stomach. A  muscular imbalance of the eyes makes me look in opposite  directions, and my mother refers to me affectionately as "tuna fish."  So far so good.  1983  Nearly fail kindergarten because I refuse to learn the  alphabet. My teacher refuses to explain why I should learn it, opting  instead for "I'm the teacher—that's why." I tell her that's stupid and  ask her to leave me alone so I can focus on drawing sharks. She  sends me to the "bad table" instead and makes me eat a bar of soap.  Disdain for authority begins.  1991  My first job. Ah, the memories. I'm hired for minimum  wage as the cleaner at an ice cream parlor and quickly realize that the  big boss's methods duplicate effort. I do it my way, finish in one hour  instead of eight, and spend the rest of the time reading kung-fu  magazines and practicing karate kicks outside. I am fired in a record  three days, left with the parting comme nt, "Maybe someday you'll  understand the value of hard work." It seems I still don't.  1993  I volunteer for a one-year exchange program in Japan,  where people work themselves to death—a phenomenon called  karooshi—and are said to want to be Shinto when born, Christian  when married, and Buddhist when they die. I conclude that most  people are really confused about life. One evening, intending to ask  my host mother to wake me the next morning (okosu), I ask her to  violently rape me (okasu). She is very confused.  1996 I manage to slip undetecte d into Princeton, despite SAT  scores 40% lower than the average and my high school admissions  counselor telling me to be more "realistic." I conclude I'm just not  good at reality. I major in neuroscience and then switch to East Asian  studies to avoid putting printer jacks on cat heads.  1997 Millionaire time! I create an audiobook  called How I Beat  the Ivy League, use all my money from three summe r jobs to manu- facture 500 tapes, and proceed to sell exactly none. I will allow my  ======================================== [Página 27] ======================================== Chronology of a Pathology 15  mother to throw them out only in 2006,  just nine years of denial  later. Such is the joy of baseless overconfidence.  1998  After four shot-putters kick a friend's head in, I quit  bouncing, the highest-paying job on campus, and develop a speed- reading seminar. I plaster campus with hundreds of god-awful neon  green flyers that read, "TRIPLE YOU R READING SPEED IN 3 HOURS!"  and prototypical Princeton students proceed to write "bullsh*t" on  every single one. I sell 32 spots at $50 each for the 3-hour event, and  $533 Per hour convinces me that finding a market before designing a  product is smarter than the reverse. Two months later, I'm bored to  tears of speed-reading and close up shop. I hate services and need a  product to ship.  Fall 1998 A huge thesis dispute and the acute fear of becoming an  investment banker drive me to commit academic suicide and inform  the registrar that I am quitting school until further notice. My dad is  convinced that I'll never go back, and I'm convinced that my life is  over. My mom thinks it's no big deal and that there is no need to be a  drama queen.  Spring 1999  In three months, I accept and quit jobs as a cur- riculum designer at Berlitz, the world's largest publisher of foreign- language mate rials, and as an analyst at a three-person political  asylum research firm. Naturally, I then fly to Taiwan to create a gym  chain out of thin air and get shut down by Triads, Chinese mafia. I  return to the United States defeated and decide to learn kickboxing,  winning the national championship four weeks later with the ugliest  and most unorthodo x style ever witnessed.  Fall 2000 Confidence restored and thesis completely undone, I  return to Princeton. My life does not end, and it seems the yearlong  delay has worked out in my favor. Twenty-somethings now have  David Koresh-like abilities. My friend sells a company for $450  million, and I decide to head west to sunny California to make my  billions. Despite the hottest job market in the history of the world, I  manage to go jobless until three months after graduation,  ======================================== [Página 28] ======================================== 16 FIRST AND FOREMOST  when I pull out my trump card and send one start-up CEO 32 con- secutive e-mails. He finally gives in and puts me in sales.  Spring 2001 TrueSAN Networks has gone from a 15-person  nobody to the "number one privately held data storage company"  (how is that measured?) with 150 employees (what are they all  doing?). I am ordered by a newly appointed sales director to "start  with A" in the phone book and dial for dollars. I ask him in the most  tactful way possible why we are doing it like retards. He says, "Be- cause I say so." Not a good start.  Fall 2001 After a year of 12-hour days, I find out that I'm the  second-lowest-paid person in the company aside from the recep- tionist. I resort to aggressively surfing the Web full-time. One after- noon , having run out of obscene video clips to forward, I investigate  how hard it would be to start a dietary suppleme nt company. Turns  out that you can outsource everything from manufacturing to ad  design. Two weeks and $5,000 of credit card debt later, I have my  first batch in production and a live website. Good thing, too, as I'm  fired exactly one week later.  2002-2003  BrainQUICKEN LLC has taken off, and I'm now  making more than $4oK per month instead of $4oK per year. The  only problem is that I hate life and now work 12-hour-plus days 7  days a week. Kinda painted myself into a corner. I take a one-week  "vacation" to Florence, Italy, with my family and spend 10 hours a  day in an Internet cafe freaking out. Sh*t balls. I begin teaching  Princeton students how to build "successful" (i.e., profitable)  companies.  Winter 2004  The impossible happens and I'm approached by an  infomercial production company and an Israeli conglomerate (huh?)  interested in buying my baby BrainQUICKEN.

Soon thereafter, both companies attem pt to replicate my product and  lose millions of dollars.  ======================================== [Página 29] ======================================== Chronology of a Pathology 17  June 2004 I decide that, even if my company implodes, I need to  escape before I go Howard Hughes. I turn everything upside down  and—b ackpack in hand—go to JFK Airport in New York City,  buying the first one-way ticket to Europe I can find. I land in London  and intend to continue on to Spain for four weeks of recharging my  batteries before returning to the salt mines. I start my relaxation by  promptly having a nervous breakdown the first morning.  July 2004-2005  Four weeks turn into eight, and I decide to stay  overseas indefinitely for a final exam in automation and experi- mental living, limiting e-mail to one hour each Monday morning. As  soon as I remove myself as a bottleneck, profits increase 40%. What  on earth do you do when you no longer have work as an excuse to be  hyperactive and avoid the big questions?

The New Rich can be separated from  the crowd based on their goals, which reflect very distinct priorities  and life philosophies.

Even the first, as I  will show later, applies to employees.  D: To work for yourself. NR: To  have others work for you.  D: To work when you want to.

After years of repetitive work,  you will often need to dig hard to find your passions, redefine  your dreams, and revive hobbies that you let atrophy to near  extinction.

Lemm ings no more. The blind quest for cash is  a fool's errand.

Here's the  little secret I rarely tell: It all cost less than rent in the United States.  If you can free your time and location, your money is automatically  worth 3-10 times as much.  This has nothing to do with currency rates. Being financially rich  and having the ability to live like a millionaire are fundamentally two  very different things.  Money is multiplied in practica l value depending on the number  of W's you control in your life: what you do, -when you do it,  where you do it, and with whom you do it. I call this the "freedom  multiplier."  Using this as our criterion, the 80-hour-per-week, $500,ooo-per- year investment banker is less "powerful" than the employed NR who  works x/i the hours for $40,000,  but has complete freedom of when,  where, and how to live.

So, Who Are the NR?  ■-The employee who rearranges his schedule and negotiates a remote  work agreeme nt to achieve 90% of the results in one-tenth of the  time, which frees him to practice cross-country skiing and take road  trips with his family two weeks per month.  ■-The business owner who eliminates the least profitable customers  and projects, outsources all operations entirely, and travels the  world collecting rare documents, all while working remotely on a  website to showcase her own illustration work.

The options are limitless, but each path begins with the same first  step: replacing assumptions.  To join the movement, you will need to learn a new lexicon and  recalibrate direction using a compass for an unusual world.

Dale Begg-Smith executed the backflip perfectly—skis crossed in an X  over his head—and landed in the record books as he slid across the finish.  It was February 16, 2006 , and he was now a mogul-skiing gold medalist at  the Turin Winter Olympics. Unlike other full-time athletes, he will never have to  return to a dead-end job after his moment of glory, nor will he look back at this  day as the climax of his only passion. After all, he was only 21 years old and  drove a black Lamborghini.  Born a Canadian and something of a late bloomer, Dale found his calling, an  Internet-based IT company, at the age of 13. Fortunately, he had a more- experienced mentor and partner to guide him: his 15-year-old brother, Jason.  Created to fund their dreams of standing atop the Olympic podium, it would, only  two years later, become the third-largest company of its kind in the world.  While Dale's teammates were hitting the slopes for extra sessions, he was  often buying sake for clients in Tokyo. In a world of "work harder, not smarter," it  came to pass that his coaches felt he was spending too much time on his  business and not enough time in training, despite his results.  Rather than choose between his business or his dream, Dale chose to move  laterally with both, from either/or to both/and. He wasn't spending too much time  on his business; he and his brother were spending too much time with Canucks.  In 2002 , they moved to the ski capital of the world, Australia, where the team  was smaller, more flexible, and coached by a legend. Three short years later, he  received citizenship, went head-to-head A  ======================================== [Página 39] ======================================== Cautions and Comparisons 27  against former teammates, and became the third "Aussie" in history to win winter  gold.  In the land of wallabies and big surf, Dale has since gone postal. Literally.  Right next to the Elvis Presley commemorative edition, you can buy stamps with  his face on them.

NEW CALED ONIA, SOUTH PACIFIC OCEAN  Once you say you're going to settle for second, that's what  happens to you in life. —JOHN F. KENNEDY  ome people remain convinced that just a bit more money will make things  right. Their goals are arbitrary moving targets: $300 ,000 in the bank,  $1,000,000 in the portfolio, $100 ,000 a year instead of $50,000, etc. Julie's goal  made intrinsic sense: come back with the same number of children she had left  with.  She reclined in her seat and glanced across the aisle past her sleeping  husband, Marc, counting as she had done thousands of times—one, two, three.  So far so good. In 12 hours, they would all be back in Paris, safe and sound. That  was assuming the plane from New Caledonia held together, of course.  New Caledonia?  Nestled in the tropics of the Coral Sea, New Caledonia was a French territory  and where Julie and Marc had just sold the sailboat that took them 15,000 miles  around the world. Of course, recouping their initial investment had been part of  the plan. All said and done, their 15-month exploration of the globe, from the  gondola-rich waterways of Venice to the tribal shores of Polynesia, had cost  between $18,000 and $19,000. Less than rent and baguettes in Paris.  Most people would consider this impossible. Then again,,most people don't  know that more than 300 families set sail from France each year to do the same.  The trip had been a dream for almost two decades, relegated to the back of  the line behind an ever-growing list of responsibilities. Each passing moment  brought a new list of reasons for putting it off. S  ======================================== [Página 40] ======================================== 28 STEP  I; D IS FOR DEFINITION  One day, Julie realized that if she didn't do it now, she would never do it. The  rationalizations, legitimate or not, would just continue to add up and make it  harder to convince herself that escape was possible.  One year of preparation and one 30-day trial run with her husband later, they  set sail on the trip of a lifetime. Julie realized almost as soon as the anchor lifted  that, far from being a reason not to travel and seek adventure, children are  perhaps the best reason of all to do both.  Pre-trip, her three little boys had fought like banshees at the drop of a hat. In  the process of learning to coexist in a floating bedroom, they learned patience, as  much for themselves as for the sanity of their parents. Pre-trip, books were about  as appealing as eating sand. Given the alternative of staring at a wall on the open  sea, all three learned to love books. Pulling them out of school for one academic  year and exposing them to new environments had proven to be the best  investment in their education to date.  Now sitting in the plane, Julie looked out at the clouds as the wing cut past  them, already thinking of their next plans: to find a place in the mountains and ski  all year long, using income from a sail-rigging workshop to fund the slopes and  more travel.  Now that she had done it once, she had the itch.  ======================================== [Página 41] ======================================== e  Rules That Change the Rules  -EVERYTHING POPULAR IS WRONG  I can't give you a surefire formula for success, but I can give  you a formula for failure: try to please everybody all the  time.  —HERBERT BAYARD SWOPE, American editor and  journalist; first recipient of the Pulitzer Prize  Everything popular is wrong.  —OSCAR WILDE, The Importance of Being Earnest  Beating the Game, Not Playing the Game  n 1999 , sometime after quitting my second unfulfilling job and eating  peanut-butter sandwiches for comfort, I won the gold medal at the  Chinese Kickboxing National Championships.

In other words, I got  twice the results for l/s the time.  From Japan to Monaco, from globetrotting single mothers to  multimillionaire raceca r drivers, the basic rules of successful NR are  surprisingly uniform and predictably divergent from what the rest of  the world is doing.  The following rules are the fundamental differentiators to keep in  mind throughout this book.   1. Retirement Is Worst-Case-Scenario Insurance.  Retirement planning is like life insurance. It should be viewed as  nothing more than a hedge against the absolute worst-case sce- nario: in this case, becoming physically incapable of working and  needing a reservoir of capital to survive.  Retirement as a goal or final redemption is flawed for at least  three solid reasons:  a. It is predicated on the assumption that you dislike what you  are doing during the most physically capable years of your life.  This is a nonstarter—no thing can justify that sacrifice.  b. Most people will never be able to retire and maintain even a  hotdogs-for-dinner standard of living. Even one million is  chump change in a world where traditional retirement could  span 30 years and inflation lowers your purchasing power 2-4%  per year. The math doesn't work.4 The golden years become  lower-middle-class life revisited. That's a bittersweet ending.  c. If the math does work, it means that you are one ambitious,  hardworking machine. If that's the case, guess what? One  week into retirement, you'll be so damn bored that you'll want  to stick bicycle spokes in your eyes. You'll probably opt to look  for a new job or start another company. Kinda defeats the  purpose of waiting, doesn't it?  4. "Living Well" (Barron's, March 20, 2006 , Suzanne McGee).  ======================================== [Página 44] ======================================== 32 STEP I: D IS FOR DEFINITION  I'm not saying don't plan for the worst case—I have maxed  out 40i(k)s and IRAs I use primarily for tax purposes—bu t don't  mistake retirement for the goal.  2. Interest and Energy Are Cyclical.  If I offered you $10,00 0,000 to work 24 hours a day for 15 years  and then retire, would you do it? Of course not—you couldn't. It  is unsustainable, just as what most define as a career: doing the  same thing for 8+ hours per day until you break down or have  enough cash to permanently stop.  How else can my 30-year-old friends all look like a cross  between Donald Trump and Joan Rivers? It's horrendous—  premat ure aging fueled by triple bypass frappuccinos and im- possible workloads.  Alternating periods of activity and rest is necessary to survive,  let alone thrive. Capacity, interest, and mental endurance all wax  and wane. Plan accordingly.  The NR aims to distribute "mini-retirements" throughout life  instead of hoarding the recovery and enjoyment for the fool's gold  of retirement. By working only when you are most effective, life  is both more productive and more enjoyable. It's the perfect  example of having your cake and eating it, too.  Personally, I now aim for one month of overseas relocation or  high-intensity learning (tango, fighting, whatever) for every two  months of work projects.  3. Less Is Not Laziness.  Doing less meaningless work, so that you can focus on things of  greater personal importance, is NOT laziness. This is hard for  most to accept, because our culture tends to reward personal  sacrifice instead of personal productivity.  Few people choose to (or are able to) measure the results of  ======================================== [Página 45] ======================================== Rules That Change the Rules 33  their actions and thus measure their contribution in time. More  time equals more self-worth and more reinforceme nt from those  above and around them. The NR, despite fewer hours in the  office, produce more meaningful results than the next dozen non- NR combined.  Let's define "laziness" anew—to endure a non-ideal existence  to let circumstance or others decide life for you, or to amass a  fortune while passing through life like a spectator from an office  window. The size of your bank account doesn't change this, nor  does the number of hours you log in handling unimportant e-mail  or minutiae.  Focus on being productive instead of busy.  4. The Timing Is Never Right.  I once asked my mom how she decided when to have her first  child, little oP me. The answer was simple: "It was something we  wanted, and we decided there was no point in putting it off. The  timing is never right to have a baby." And so it is.  For all of the most important things, the timing always sucks.  Waiti ng for a good time to quit your job? The stars will never  align and the traffic lights of life will never all be green at the  same time. The universe doesn't conspire against you, but it  doesn't go out of its way to line up all the pins either. Conditions  are never perfect. "Someday" is a disease that will take your  dreams to the grave with you. Pro and con lists are just as bad. If  it's important to you and you want to do it "eventually," just do it  and correct course along the way.  5. Ask for Forgiveness, Not Permission.  If it isn't going to devastate those around you, try it and then  justify it. People—whether parents, partners, or bosses—deny  things on an emotional basis that they can learn to accept  ======================================== [Página 46] ======================================== 34 STEP  I: D IS FOR DEFINITION  after the fact. If the potential damage is moderate or in any way  reversible, don't give people the chance to say no. Most people  are fast to stop you before you get started but hesitant to get in the  way if you're moving. Get good at being a troublemaker and  saying sorry when you really screw up.  6. Emphasize Strengths, Don't Fix Weaknesses.  Most people are good at a handful of things and utterly miserable  at most. I am great at product creation and marketing but terrible  at most of the things that follow.  My body is designed to lift heavy objects and throw them, and  that's it. I ignored this for a long time. I tried swimming and  looked like a drowning monkey. I tried basketball and looked like  a caveman. Then I became  a fighter and took off.  It is far more lucrative and fun to leverage your strengths in- stead of attem pting to fix all the chinks in your armor. The choice  is between multiplication of results using strengths or incremental  improvement fixing weaknesses that will, at best, become  mediocre. Focus on better use of your best weapons instead of  constant repair.  7. Things in Excess Become Their Opposite.  It is possible to have too much of a good thing. In excess, most  endeavors and possessions take on the characteristics of their  opposite. Thus:  Pacifists become militants. Freedom  fighters become tyrants. Blessings  become curses. Help becomes  hindrance. More becomes less.5  5. From Less Is More. Goldian VandenBroeck.  ======================================== [Página 47] ======================================== Rules That Change the Rules 35  Too much, too many, and too often of what you want becomes  what you don't want. This is true of possessions and even time.  Lifestyle Design is thus not interested in creating an excess of idle  time, which is poisonous, but the positive use of free time, defined  simply as doing what you want as opposed to what you feel  obligated to do.  8. Money Alone Is Not the Solution.  There is much to be said for the power of money as currency (I'm  a fan myself), but adding more of it just isn't the answer as often  as we'd like to think. In part, it's laziness. "If only I had more  money" is the easiest way to postpone the intense self- examination and decision-making necessary to create a life of  enjoyment—no w and not later. By using money as the scapegoat  and work as our all-consuming routine, we are able to  conveniently disallow ourselves the time to do otherwise: "John,  I'd love to talk about the gaping void I feel in my life, the  hopelessness that hits me like a punch in the eye every time I start  my computer in the morning, but I have so much work to do! I've  got at least three hours of unimportant e-mail to reply to before  calling the prospects who said 'no' yesterday. Gotta run!"  Busy yourself with the routine of the money wheel, pretend  it's the fix-all, and you artfully create a constant distraction that  prevents you from seeing just how pointless it is. Deep down, you  know it's all an illusion, but with everyone participating in the  same game of make-believe, it's easy to forget.  The problem is more than money.  9. Relative Income Is More Important Than Absolute Income.  Among dietitians and nutritionists, there is some debate over the  value of a calorie. Is a calorie a calorie, much like a rose is a  rose? Is fat loss as simple as expending more calories than you  ======================================== [Página 48] ======================================== 36 STEP I: D IS FOR DEFINITION  consume, or is the source of those calories important? Based on  work with top athletes, I know the answer to be the latter.  What about income? Is a dollar is a dollar is a dollar? The  New Rich don't think so.  Let's look at this like a fifth-grade math problem. Two hard- working chaps are headed toward each other. Chap A moving at  80 hours per week and Chap B moving at 10 hours per week.  They both make $50,000  per year. Who will be richer when they  pass in the middle of the night? If you said B, you would be cor- rect, and this is the difference between absolute and relative  income.  Absolute income is measured using one holy and inalterable  variable: the raw and almighty dollar. Jane Doe makes $100 ,000  per year and is thus twice as rich as John Doe, who makes  $50,000 per year.  Relative income uses two variables: the dollar and time, usu- ally hours. The whole "per year" concept is arbitrary and makes it  easy to trick yourself. Let's look at the real trade. Jane Doe makes  $100,000  per year, $2,000 for each of 50 weeks per year, and  works 80 hours per week. Jane Doe thus makes $25 per hour.  John Doe makes $50,000  per year, $1,000  for each of 50 weeks  per year, but works 10 hours per week and hence makes $100  per  hour. In relative income, John is four times richer.  Of course, relative income has to add up to the minimum  amount necessary to actualize your goals. If I make $100  per hour  but only work one hour per week, it's going to be hard for me to  run amuck like a superstar. Assuming that the total absolute  income is where it needs to be to live my dreams (not an arbitrary  point of comparison with the Joneses), relative income is the real  measurement of wealth for the New Rich.  The top New Rich mavericks make at least $5,00 0 per hour.  Out of college, I started at about $5. I'll get you closer to the  former.  ======================================== [Página 49] ======================================== Rules That Change the Rules 37  10. Distress Is Bad, Eustress Is Good.  Unbeknownst to most fun-loving bipeds, not all stress is bad. In- deed, the New Rich don't aim to eliminate all stress. Not in the  least. There are two separate types of stress, each as different as  euphoria and its seldom-mentioned opposite, dysphoria.  Distress refers to harmful stimuli that make you weaker, less  confident, and less able. Destructive criticism, abusive bosses,  and smashing your face on a curb are examples of this. These are  things we want to avoid.  Eustress, on the other hand, is a word most of you have probably  never heard. Eu-, a Greek prefix for "healthy," is used in the same  sense in the word "euphoria." Role models who push us to exceed  our limits, physical training that removes our spare tires, and risks  that expand our sphere of comfortable action are all examples of  eustress—stress that is healthful and the stimulus for growth.  People who avoid all criticism fail. It's destructive criticism  we need to avoid, not criticism in all forms. Similarly, there is no  progress without eustress, and the more eustress we can create or  apply to our lives, the sooner we can actualize our dreams. The  trick is telling the two apart.  The New Rich are equally aggressive in removing distress and  finding eustress.  -Q&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS  i. How has being "realistic" or "responsible" kept you from the life  you want?  2.

"Run! Ruuuuuuuuuun!" Hans didn't speak  Portuguese, but the meaning was clear enough—haul ass. His sneakers  gripped firmly on the jagged rock, and he drove his chest forward toward  3,000 feet of nothing.  He held his breath on the final step, and the panic drove him to near  unconsciousness. His vision blurred at the edges, closing to a single pinpoint  of light, and then ... he floated. The all-consuming celestial blue of the  horizon hit his visual field an instant after he realized that the thermal  updraft had caught him and the wings of the paraglider. Fear was behind  him on the mountaintop, and thousands of feet above the resplendent green  rain forest and pristine white beaches of Copacabana, Hans Keeling had  seen the light.  That was Sunday.  On Monday, Hans returned to his law office in Century City, Los  Angeles's posh corporate haven, and promptly handed in his three-week  notice. For nearly five years, he had faced his alarm T  ======================================== [Página 51] ======================================== Dodging Bullets 39  clock with the same dread: I have to do this for another 40-45 years?  He had once slept under his desk at the office after a punishing half- done project, only to wake up and continue on it the next morning.  That same morning, he had made himself a promise: two more times  and I'm out of here. Strike number three came  the day before he left  for his Brazilian vacation.  We all make these promises to ourselves, and Hans had done it  before as well, but things were now somehow different. He was dif- ferent. He had realized something while arcing in slow circles toward  the earth—risks weren't that scary once you took them. His  colleagues told him what he expected to hear: He was throwing it all  away. He was an attorney on his way to the top—what the hell did he  want?  Hans didn't know exactly what he wanted, but he had tasted it. On  the other hand, he did know what bored him to tears, and he was  done with it. No more passing days as the living dead, no more din- ners where his colleagues compared cars, riding on the sugar high of  a new BMW purchase until someone bought a more expensive  Mercedes. It was over.  Imme diately, a strange shift began—Hans felt, for the first time in  a long time, at peace with himself and what he was doing. He had  always been terrified of plane turbulence, as if he might die with the  best inside of him, but now he could fly through a violent storm  sleeping like a baby. Strange indeed.  More than a year later, he was still getting unsolicited job offers  from law firms, but by then had started Nexus Surf, a premier surf- adventure company based in the tropical paradise of Florianopo lis,  Brazil. He had met his dream girl, a Carioca with caramel-colored  skin named Tatiana, and spent most of his time relaxing under palm  trees or treating clients to the best times of their lives.  Is this what he had been so afraid of?  These days, he often sees his former self in the underjoyed and  overworked professionals he takes out on the waves.

His reply is always the same: "You can."  The setting sun reflects off the surface of the water, providing a  Zen-like setting for a message he knows is true: It's not giving up to  put your current path on indefinite pause. He could pick up his law  career exactly where he left off if he wanted to, but that is the fur- thest thing from his mind.  As they paddle back to shore after an awesome session, his  clients get ahold of themselves and regain their composure. They set  foot on shore, and reality sinks its fangs in: "I would, but I can't  really throw it all away."  He has to laugh.  The Power of Pessimism: Defining the Nightmare  Action may not always bring happiness, but there is no  happiness without action.  —BENJAMIN DISRAELI, former British Prime Minister  o do or not to do? To try or not to try? Most people will vote no,  whether they consider themselves brave or not. Uncertainty and  the prospect of failure can be very scary noises in the shadows. Most  people will choose unhappiness over uncertainty. For years, I set  goals, made resolutions to change direction, and nothing came  of  either. I was just as insecure and scared as the rest of the world.  The simple solution came  to me accidentally four years ago. At  that time, I had more money than I knew what to do with—I was  making $7oK or so per month—and I was completely miserable,  worse than ever. I had no time and was working myself to death. I  had started my own company, only to realize it would be nearly  impossible to sell. Oops. I felt trapped and stupid at the same time. T ======================================== [Página 53] ======================================== Dodging Bullets 41  I should be able to figure this out, I thought. Why am I such an idiot?  Why can't I make this work?! Buckle up and stop being such a (insert  expletive)! What's wrong with me? The truth was, nothing was  wrong with me. I hadn't reached my limit; I'd reached the limit of my  business model at the time. It wasn't the driver, it was the vehicle.  Critical mistakes in its infancy would never let me sell it. I could  hire magic elves and connect my brain to a supercomputer—it didn't  matte r. My little baby had some serious birth defects. The question  then became , How do I free myself from this Frankenstein while  making it self-sustaining? How do I pry myself from the tentacles of  workaholism and the fear that it would fall to pieces without my 15- hour days? How do I escape this self-made prison? A trip, I decided.  A sabbatical year around the world.  So I took the trip, right? Well, I'll get to that. First, I felt it prudent  to dance around with my shame, embarrassment, and anger for six  months, all the while playing an endless loop of reasons why my  cop-out fantasy trip could never work. One of my more productive  periods, for sure.  Then, one day, in my bliss of envisioning how bad my future suf- fering would be, I hit upon a gem of an idea. It was surely a highlight  of my "don't happy, be worry" phase: Why don't I decide exactly  what my nightmare would be—the worst thing that could possibly  happen as a result of my trip?  Well, my business could fail while I'm overseas, for sure. Proba- bly would. A legal warning letter would accidentally not get for- warded and I would get sued. My business would be shut down, and  inventory would spoil on the shelves while I'm picking my toes in  solitary misery on some cold shore in Ireland. Crying in the rain, I  imagine. My bank account would crater by 80% and certainly my car  and motorcycle in storage would be stolen. I suppose someone would  probably spit on my head from a high-rise balcony while I'm  ======================================== [Página 54] ======================================== 42 STEP I: D IS FOR DEFINITION  feeding food scraps to a stray dog, which would then spook and bite me  squarely on the face. God, life is a cruel, hard bitch.

In my undying quest to make myself  miserable, I accidentally began to backpedal. As soon as I cut through  the vague unease and ambiguous anxiety by defining my nightmare, the  worst-case scenario, I wasn't as worried about taking a trip. Suddenly, I  started thinking of simple steps I could take to salvage my remaining  resources and get back on track if all hell struck at once. I could always take  a temporary bartending job to pay the rent if I had to. I could sell some  furniture and cut back on eating out. I could steal lunch money from the  kindergarteners who passed by my apartment every morning. The options  were many. I realized it wouldn't be that hard to get back to where I was, let  alone survive. None of these things would be fatal—not even close. Mere  panty pinches on the journey of life.  I realized that on a scale of I-IO, i being nothing and 10 being  permanently life-changing, my so-called worst-case scenario might have a  temporary impact of 3 or 4. I believe this is true of most people and most  would-be "holy sh*t, my life is over" disasters. Keep in mind that this is the  one-in-a-million disaster nightmare. On the other hand, if I realized my best- case scenario, or even a probable-case scenario, it would easily have a  permanent 9 or 10 positive life-changing effect.  In other words, I was risking an unlikely and temporary 3 or 4 for a  probable and permanent 9 or 10, and I could easily recover my T ======================================== [Página 55] ======================================== Dodging Bullets 43  baseline workaholic prison with a bit of extra work if I wanted to.  This all equated to a significant realization: There was practically no  risk, only huge life-changing upside potential, and I could resume  my previous course without any more effort than I was already  putting forth.  That is when I made the decision to take the trip and bought a  one-way ticket to Europe. I started planning my adventures and  eliminating my physical and psychological baggage. None of my dis- asters came  to pass, and my life has been a near fairy tale since. The  business did better than ever, and I practical ly forgot about it as it  financed my travels around the world in style for 15 months.  Uncovering Fear Disguised as Optimism  There's no difference between a pessimist who says, "Oh, it's  hopeless, so don 't bother doing anything," and an optimist  who says, "Don't bother doing anything, it's going to turn out  fine anyway."

Most intelligent  people in the world dress it up as something else: optimistic denial.  Most who avoid quitting their jobs entertain the thought that their  course will improve with time or increases in income. This seems  valid and is a tempting hallucination when a job is boring or  uninspiring instead of pure hell. Pure hell forces action, but anything  less can be endured with enough clever rationalization.  Do you really think it will improve or is it wishful thinking and  an excuse for inaction?

Jean-Marc Hachey landed in West Africa as a volunteer, with high hopes of  lending a helping hand. In that sense, his timing was great. He arrived in Ghana  in the early 1980 s, in the middle of a coup d'etat, at the peak of hyperinflation,  and just in time for the worst drought in a decade. For these same reasons, some  people would consider his timing quite poor from a more selfish survival  standpoint.

The national menu had changed, and they  were out of luxuries like bread and clean water. He would be surviving for four  months on a slushlike concoction of corn meal and spinach. Not what most of us  would order at the movie theater.  "WOW, 1 CAN  SURVIVE."  ean-Marc had passed the point of no return, but it didn't matter. After two weeks  of adjusting to the breakfast, lunch , and dinner (Mush a la Ghana), he had no  desire to escape. The most basic of foods and good friends proved to be the only  real necessities, and what would seem like a disaster from the outside was the  most life-affirming epiphany he'd ever experienced: The worst really wasn't that  bad. To enjoy life, you don't need fancy nonsense, but you do need to control  your time and realize that most things just aren't as serious as you make them  out to be.  Now 48, Jean-Marc lives in a nice home in Ontario, but could live without it.  He has cash, but could fall into poverty tomorrow and it wouldn't matter. Some of  his fondest memories still include nothing but friends and gruel. He is dedicated  to creating special moments for himself and his family and is utterly unconcerned  with retirement. He's already lived 20 years of partial retirement in perfect health.  Don't save it all for the end.

Define your nightmare, the absolute worst that could happen if you  did what you are considering. What doubt, fears, and "what-ifs"  pop up as you consider the big changes you can—or need—to  make? Envision them in painstaking detail. Would it be the end of  your life? What would be the permanent impact, if any, on a scale  of i-io? Are these things really permanent? How likely do you  think it is that they would actually happen?  2. What steps could you take to repair the damage or get things back  on the upswing, even if temporarily? Chances are, it's easier than  you imagine. How could you get things back under control?  3. What are the outcomes or benefits, both temporary and per- manent, of more probable scenarios? Now that you've defined the  nightmare, what are the more probable or definite positive  outcomes, whether internal (confidence, self-esteem , etc.) or ex- ternal? What would the impact of these more-likely outcomes be  on a scale of 1-10? How likely is it that you could produce at least  a moderately good outcome? Have less intelligent people done  this before and pulled it off?  4. If you were fired from your job today, what would you do to get  things under financial control? Imagine this scenario and run  through questions 1-3 above. If you quit your job to test other  options, how could you later get back on the same career track if  you absolutely had to?  5. What are you putting off out of fear? Usually, what we most fear  doing is what we most need to do. That phone call, that con- versation, whatever the action might be—it is fear of unkno wn  outcomes that prevents us from doing what we need to do. Define  the worst case, accept it, and do it. I'll repeat something you  might consider tattooing on your forehead: What we fear doing  most is usually what we most need to do. As I have heard said, a per-  ======================================== [Página 59] ======================================== Dodging Bullets 47  son's success in life can usually be measured by the number of  uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have. Resolve  to do one thing every day that you fear. I got into this habit by  attem pting to contact celebrities and famous businesspeople for  advice.  6. What is it costing you—financially, emotionally, and physically— to postpone action? Don't only evaluate the potential downside of  action. It is equally important to measure the atrocious cost of  inaction. If you don't pursue those things that excite you, where  will you be in one year, five years, and ten years? How will you  feel having allowed circumstance to impose itself upon you and  having allowed ten more years of your finite life to pass doing  what you know will not fulfill you? If you telescope out 10 years  and know with 100%  certainty that it is a path of disappointment  and regret, and if we define risk as "the likelihood of an  irreversible negative outcome," inaction is the greatest risk of all.  7. What are you waiting for? If you cannot answer this without  resorting to the previously rejected concept of good timing, the  answer is simple: You're afraid, just like the rest of the world.  Measure the cost of inaction, realize the unlikelihood and re- pairability of most missteps, and develop the most important habit  of those who excel and enjoy doing so: action.  ======================================== [Página 60] ======================================== System Reset  -BEING UNREASONABLE AND UNAMBIGUOUS   "Wou ld you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from  here?"

They formed a circle  around  me, and, while the names differed, the question was one and the  same: "What's the challenge?" All eyes were on me.  My lecture at Princeton University had just ended with excitement and  enthusiasm. At the same time, I knew that most students would go out and  promptly do the opposite of what I preached. Most of them would be putting  in 80-hour weeks as high-paid coffee fetchers unless I showed that the  principles from class could actually be applied. I ======================================== [Página 61] ======================================== System Reset 49  Hence the challenge.  I was offering a round-trip ticket anywhere in the world to anyone  who could complete an undefined "challenge" in the most impressive  fashion possible. Results plus style. I told them to meet  me after  class if interested, and here they were, nearly 20 out of 60 students.  The task was designed to test their comfort zones while forcing  them to use some of the tactics I teach. It was simplicity itself:  Contact three seemingly impossible-to-reach people—J.Lo, Bill  Clinton, }. D. Salinger, I don't care—and get at least one to reply to  three questions.  Of 20 students, all frothing at the mouth to win a free spin across  the globe, how many completed the challenge?  Exactly ... none. Not a one.  There were many excuses: "It's not that easy to get someone to  ..." "I have a big paper due, and ..." "I would love to, but there's no  way I can. . . ." There was but one real reason, however, repeated  over and over again in different words: It was a difficult challenge,  perhaps impossible, and the other students would oudo them. Since  all of them overestimate d the competition, no one even showed up.  According to the rules I had set, if someone had sent me no more  than an illegible one-paragraph response, I would have been obli- gated to give them the prize. This result both fascinated and de- pressed me.  The following year, the outcome was quite different.  I told the above cautionary tale and 6 out of 17 finished the chal- lenge in less than 48 hours. Was the second class better? No. In fact,  there were more capable students in the first class, but they did  nothing. Firepower up the wazoo and no trigger finger.

It's lonely at the top. Ninety-nine percent of people in the world  are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they  aim for the mediocre. The level of competition is thus fiercest for  "realistic" goals, paradoxically making them the most time-and  energy-consuming. It is easier to raise $10,00 0,000 than it is  $1,000,00 0. It is easier to pick up the one perfect 10 in the bar than  the five 8s.  If you are insecure, guess what? The rest of the world is, too. Do  not overestimate  the competition and underestimate  yourself. You  are better than you think.  Unreasonable and unrealistic goals are easier to achieve for yet  another reason.  Having an unusually large goal is an adrenaline infusion that  provides the endurance to overcome the inevitable trials and tribu- lations that go along with any goal. Realistic goals, goals restricted to  the average ambition level, are uninspiring and will only fuel you  through the first or second problem, at which point you throw in the  towel. If the potential payoff is mediocre or average, so is your ef- fort. I'll run through walls to get a catama ran trip through the Greek  islands, but I might not change my brand of cereal for a weekend trip  through Columbus, Ohio. If I choose the latter because it is "realis- tic," I won't have the enthusiasm to jump even the smallest hurdle to  accomplish it. With beautiful, crystal-clear Greek waters and deli- cious wine on the brain, I'm prepared to do battle for a dream that is  worth dreaming. Even though their difficulty of achievement on a  scale of 1-10 appears to be a 10 and a 2 respectively, Columbus is  more likely to fall through. F  ======================================== [Página 63] ======================================== System Reset 51  The fishing is best where the fewest go, and the collective insecu- rity of the world makes it easy for people to hit home runs while  everyone else is aiming for base hits. There is just less competition  for bigger goals.  Doing big things begins with asking for them properly.  What Do You Want? A Better Question, First of All  ost people will never know what they want. I don't know what I  want. If you ask me what I want to do in the next five months  for language learning, on the other hand, I do know. It's a matte r of  specificity. "What do you want?" is too imprecise to produce a  meaningful and actionable answer. Forget about it.  "What are your goals?" is similarly fated for confusion and  guesswork. To rephrase the question, we need to take a step back and  look at the bigger picture.  Let's assume we have 10 goals and we achieve them—what is the  desired outcome that makes all the effort worthwhile? The most  common response is what I also would have suggested five years  ago: happiness. I no longer believe this is a good answer. Happiness  can be bought with a bottle of wine and has become ambiguous  through overuse. There is a more precise alternative that reflects  what I believe the actual objective is.  Bear with me. What is the opposite of happiness? Sadness? No.  Just as love and hate are two sides of the same coin, so are happiness  and sadness. Crying out of happiness is a perfect illustration of this.  The opposite of love is indifference, and the opposite of happiness  is—here's the clincher—boredom.  Excite ment is the more practical synonym for happiness, and it is  precisely what you should strive to chase. It is the cure-all. When people  suggest you follow your "passion" or your "bliss," I propose that they  are, in fact, referring to the same singular concept: exciteme nt.  This brings us full circle.

Adult-Onset ADD: Adventure Deficit Disorder  omewhere between college graduation and your second job, a  chorus enters your internal dialogue: Be realistic and stop pre- tending. Life isn't like the movies.  If you're five years old and say you want to be an astronaut, your  parents tell you that you can be anything you want to be. It's harm- less, like telling a child that Santa Claus exists. If you're 25 and an- nounce you want to start a new circus, the response is different: Be  realistic; become a lawyer or an accountant or a doctor, have babies,  and raise them to repeat the cycle.  If you do manage to ignore the doubters and start your own  business, for example, ADD doesn't disappear. It just takes a dif- ferent form.  When I started BrainQUICKEN LLC in 2001,  it was with a clear  goal in mind: Make $1,000 per day whether I was banging my head  on a laptop or cutting my toenails on the beach. It was to be an auto- mate d source of cash flow. If you look at my chronology, it is obvi- ous that this didn't happen until a meltdown forced it, despite the  requisite income. Why? The goal wasn't specific enough. I hadn't  defined alternate activitie s that would replace the initial workload.  Therefore, I just continued working, even though there was no fi- nancial need. I needed to feel productive and had no other vehicles.  This is how most people work until death: "I'll just work until I  have X dollars and then do what I want." If you don't define the  "what I want" alternate activities, the X figure will increase indefi- nitely to avoid the fear-inducing uncertainty of this void.

I simply  looked at those who were 15-20 years ahead of me on the same  track, whether a director of sales or an entrepreneur in the same  industry, and it scared the hell out of me.  It was such an acute phobia, and such a perfect meta phor for the  sum of all fears, that it became a pattern interrupt between myself and  fellow lifestyle designer and entrepreneur Douglas Price.

The prospect was terrifying enough that we  always got our asses and priorities back on track imme diately.

If still blocked,  fill in the five "doing" spots with the following:  one place to visit  one thing to do before you die (a mem ory of a lifetime)  one thing to do daily  one thing to do weekly  one thing you've always wanted to learn  3. What does "being" entail doing?  Convert each "being" into a "doing" to make it actionable. Iden- tify an action that would characterize this state of being or a task  that would mean you had achieved it. People find it easier to  brainstorm "being" first, but this column is just a temporary  holding spot for "doing" actions. Here are a few examples:  ======================================== [Página 68] ======================================== 56 STEP I: D IS FOR DEFINITION  Great cook ■»■ make Christmas dinner Without he\p Flcenf in  Chinese m+ha\ie a five-minute conversation With a Chinese  co-Worker  4. What are the four dreams that would change it all?  Using the 6-month timeline, star or otherwise highlight the four  most exciting and/or important dreams from all columns. Repeat  the process with the 12-month timeline if desired.  5. Determine the cost of these dreams and calculate your Tar  get Monthly Income (TMI) for both timelines.  If financeable, what is the cost per month for each of the four  dreams (rent, mortgage, payment plan installments, etc.)? Start  thinking of income and expense in terms of monthly cash flow—  dollars in and dollars out—instead of grand totals. Things often  cost much, much less than expected. For example, a Lamborghini  Gallardo Spyder, fresh off the showroom floor at $260,000,  can  be had for $2,897.80  per month. I found my personal favorite, an  Astin Martin DB9 with 1,000  miles on it, through eBay for  $136,000—$2,00 3.10 per month. How about a Round-the-World  trip (Los Angeles -> Tokyo -» Singapore -> Bangkok -» Delhi or  Bombay -> London -> Frankfurt -> Los Angeles) for $1,399?   For some of these costs, the Tools and Tricks at the end of  Chapter 14 will help.  Last, calculate your Target Monthly Income (TMI) for realizing  these dreamlines. This is how to do it: First, total each of the col- umns A, B, and C, counting only the four selected dreams. Some  of these column totals could be zero, which is fine. Next, add your  total monthly expenses x 1.3 (the 1.3 represents your expenses plus  a 30% buffer for safety or savings). This grand total is your TMI  and the target to keep in mind for the rest of the book.  I like to fur- ther divide this TMI by 30 to get my TDI—Target Daily Income. I  find it easier to work with a daily goal. Online calculators on our  companion site do all the work for you and make this step a cinch.  ======================================== [Página 69] ======================================== TARGET MONTHLY INCOME  STEP 0: HAVING    * 1.

Mobility encourages this trend. Even  if the total is intimidating, don't fret in the least. I have helped  students get to more than $10,000 per month in extra income  within three months.  6. Determine three steps for each of the four dreams in just the 6- month timeline and take the first step now. I'm not a big believer  in long-term planning and far-off goals. In fact, I generally set 3- month and 6-month dreamlines. The variables change too much  and in-the-future distance becomes an excuse for postponing  action. The objective of this exercise isn't, therefore, to outline  every step from start to finish, but to define the end goal, the  required vehicle to achieve them (TMI, TDI), and build  momentum with critical first steps. From that point, it's a matte r  of freeing time and generating the TMI, which the following  chapters cover.  First, let's focus on those critical first steps. Define three steps  for each dream that will get you closer to its actualization. Set  actions—simple, well-defined actions—for now, tomorrow  (complete before 11 A.M.) and the day after (again completed be- fore II A.M.).  Once you have three steps for each of the four goals, complete  the three actions in the "now" column. Do it now. Each should be  simple enough to do in five minutes or less. If not, rachet it down.  If it's the middle of the night and you can't call someone, do  something else now, such as send an e-mail, and set the call for  first thing tomorrow.  If the next stage is some form of research, get in touch with  someone who knows the answer instead of spending too much  time in books or online, which can turn into paralysis by analysis.  The best first step, the one I recomme nd, is finding someone  ======================================== [Página 72] ======================================== 60 STEP I: D IS FOR DEFINITION  who's done it and ask for advice on how to do the same. It's not  hard.  Other options include setting a meet ing or phone call with a  trainer, mentor, or salesperson to build momentum. Can you  schedule a private class or a commitment that you'll feel bad  about canceling? Use guilt to your advantage.  Tomorrow becomes never. No matte r how small the task, take  the first step now!  -COMFORT CHALLENGE  he most important actions are never comfortable. Fortunately, it  is possible to condition yourself to discomfort and overcome it.  I've trained myself to propose solutions instead of ask for them, to  elicit desired responses instead of react, and to be assertive without  burning bridges. To have an uncommon lifestyle, you need to develop  the uncommon habit of making decisions, both for yourself and for  others.  From this chapter forward, I'll take you through progressively  more uncomfortable exercises, simple and small. Some of the exer- cises will appear deceptively easy and even irrelevant (such as the  next) until you try them. Look at it as a game and expect some butter- flies and sweat—that's the whole point. For most of these exercises,  the duration is two days. Mark the exercise of the day on your calen- dar so you don't forget, and don't attem pt more than one Comfort  Challenge at a time.  Remember: There is a direct correlation between an increased  sphere of comfort and getting what you want.  Here we go.  Learn to Eye Gaze (2 days)  My friend Michael Ellsberg invented a singles event called Eye Gaz- ing. It is similar to speed dating but different in one fundamental T  ======================================== [Página 73] ======================================== System Reset 61  respect—no  speaking is permitted. It involves gazing into the eyes of  each partner for three minutes at a time. If you go to such an event, it  becomes clear how uncomfortable most people are doing this. For  the next two days, practice gazing into the eyes of others— whether  people you pass on the street or conversational partners— until they  break contact. Hints:  i. Focus on one eye and be sure to blink occasionally so you don't  look like a psychopath or get your ass kicked.  2. In conversation, maintain eye contact when you are speaking.  It's easy to do while listening.  3. Practice with people bigger or more confident than yourself. If  a passerby asks you what the hell you're staring at, just smile  and respond, "Sorry about that. I thought you were an old  friend of mine."  ======================================== [Página 74] ========================================   ======================================== [Página 75] ======================================== Step II: E is for  Elimination   One does not accumulate but eliminate.

In the strictest sense, you shouldn't be trying to do more in each day,  trying to fill every second with a work fidget of some type. It took me a  long time to figure this out. I used to be very fond of the results-by-volume  approach.  Being busy is most often used as a guise for avoiding the few critically  important but uncomfortable actions. The options are almost limitless for  creating "busyness": You could call a few hundred unqualified sales leads,  reorganize your Outlook contacts, walk across the office to request  documents you don't really need, or fuss with your BlackBerry for a few  hours when you should be prioritizing.  In fact, if you want to move up the ladder in most of corporate America,  and assuming they don't really check what you are doing (let's be honest),  just run around the office holding a cell phone to  ======================================== [Página 78] ======================================== 66 STEP II: E IS FOR ELIMINATION  your head and carrying papers. Now, that is one busy employee!  Give them a raise. Unfortunately for the NR, this behavior won't get  you out of the office or put you on an airplane to Brazil. Bad dog. Hit  yourself with a newspaper and cut it out.  After all, there is a far better option, and it will do more than  simply increase your results—it will multiply them. Believe it or not,  it is not only possible to accomplish more by doing less, it is  mandatory.  Enter the world of elimination.  How You Will Use Productivity  ow that you have defined what you want to do with your time,  you have to free that time. The trick, of course, is to do so while  maintaining or increasing your income.  The intention of this chapter, and what you will experience if you  follow the instructions, is an increase in personal productivity  between iod and 500%. The principles are the same for both em- ployees and entrepreneurs, but the purpose of this increased produc- tivity is completely different.  First, the employee. The employee is increasing productivity to  increase negotiating leverage for two simultaneous objectives: pay  raises and a remote working arrangement.  Recall that, as indicated in the first chapter of this book, the gen- eral process of joining the New Rich is D-E-A-L, in that order, but  that employees intent on remaining employees for now need to  implement the process asD-E-L-A. The reason relates to environ- ment. They need to Liberate themselves from the office environment  before they can work ten hours a week, for example, because the ex- pectation in that environment is that you will be in constant motion  from 9-5. Even if you produce twice the results you had in the past, if  you're working a quarter of the hours of your colleagues, there is a  good chance of receiving a pink slip. Even if you work 10 hours a N ======================================== [Página 79] ======================================== The End of Time Manage ment 67  week and produce twice the results of people working 40, the collec- tive request will be, "Work 40 hours a week and produce 8 times the  results." This is an endless game and one you want to avoid. Hence  the need for Liberation first.  If you're an employee, this chapter will increase your value and  make it more painful for the company to fire you than to grant raises  and a remote working agreeme nt. That is your goal. Once the latter is  accomplished, you can drop hours without bureaucratic interference  and use the resultant free time to fulfill dreamlines.  The entrepreneur's goals are less complex, as he or she is gener- ally the direct beneficiary of increased profit. The goal is to decrease  the amount of work you perform while increasing revenue. This will  set the stage for replacing yourself with Automation, which in turn  permits Liberation.  For both tracks, some definitions are in order.  Being Effective vs. Being Efficient  ffectiveness is doing the things that get you closer to your goals.  Efficiency is performing a given task (whether important or not)  in the most economical manner possible. Being efficient without  regard to effectiveness is the default mode of the universe.  I would consider the best door-to-door salesperson efficient—  that is, refined and excellent at selling door-to-door without wasting  time—bu t utterly ineffective. He or she would sell more using a bet- ter vehicle such as e-mail or direct mail.  This is also true for the person who checks e-mail 30 times per  day and develops an elaborate system of folder rules and sophis- ticated techniques for ensuring that each of those 30 brain farts  moves as quickly as possible. I was a specialist at such professional  wheel-spinning. It is efficient on some perverse level, but far from  effective.  Here are two truisms to keep in mind: E  ======================================== [Página 80] ======================================== 68 STEP II: E IS FOR ELIMINATION  i.   Doing something unimportant well does not make it important.  2.  Requiring a lot of time does not make a task important.  From this moment forward, remem ber this: What you do is infi- nitely more important than how you do it. Efficiency is still impor- tant, but it is useless unless applied to the right things.  To find the right things, we'll need to go to the garden.  Pareto and His Garden: 80/20 and  Freedom from Futility   What gets measured gets managed.  —PETER DRUCKER, management theorist, author of  31 book s, recipient of Presidential Medal of Freedom  our years ago, an economist changed my life forever. It's a shame  I never had a chance to buy him a drink. My dear Vilfredo died  almost 100 years ago.  Vilfredo Pareto was a wily and controversial economist-cum- sociologist who lived from 1848 to 1923. An engineer by training, he  started his varied career managing coal mines and later succeeded  Leon Walras as the chair of political economy at the University of  Lausanne in Switzerland. His seminal work, Cours d'economie poli- tique, included a then little-explored "law" of income distribution that  would later bear his name: "Pareto's Law" or the "Pareto Distribu- tion," in the last decade also popularly called the "80/20 Principle."  The mathematica l formula he used to demonstrate a grossly  uneven but predictable distribution of wealth in society—80% of the  wealth and income was produced and possessed by 20% of the  population— also applied outside of economics. Indeed, it could be  found almost everywhere. Eighty percent of Pareto's garden peas  were produced by 20% of the peapods he had planted, for example. F ======================================== [Página 81] ======================================== The End of Time Manage ment 69  Pareto's Law can be summa rized as follows: 80% of the outputs  result from 20% of the inputs. Alternative ways to phrase this, de- pending on the context, include:  80% of the consequences flow from 20% of the causes. 80% of  the results come from 20% of the effort and time. 80% of  company profits come from 20% of the products and  customers. 80% of all stock market gains are realized  by 20% of the  investors and 20% of an individual portfolio.  The list is infinitely long and diverse, and the ratio is often skewed  even more severely: 90/10, 95/5, and 99/1 are not uncommon, but  the minimum ratio to seek is 80/20.  When I came  across Pareto's work one late evening, I had been  slaving away with 15-hour days seven days per week, feeling com- pletely overwhelmed and generally helpless. I would wake up before  dawn to make calls to the United Kingdom, handle the United States  during the normal 9-5 day, and then work until near midnight making  calls to Japan and New Zealand. I was stuck on a runaway freight  train with no brakes, shoveling coal into the furnace for lack of a  better option. Faced with certain burnout or giving Pareto's ideas a  trial run, I opted for the latter. The next morning, I began a dissection  of my business and personal life through the lenses of two questions:  1. Which 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and  unhappiness?  2. Which 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired  outcomes and happiness?  For the entire day, I put aside everything seemingly urgent and  did the most intense truth-baring analysis possible, applying these  ======================================== [Página 82] ======================================== 70 STEP II: E IS FOR ELIMINATION  questions to everything from my friends to customers and advertising  to relaxation activities. Don't expect to find you're doing everything  right—the truth often hurts. The goal is to find your inefficiencies in  order to eliminate them and to find your strengths so you can  multiply them. In the 24 hours that followed, I made several simple  but emotionally difficult decisions that literally changed my life  forever and enabled the lifestyle I now enjoy.  The first decision I made is an excellent example of how dramatic  and fast the ROI of this analytical fat-cutting can be: I stopped  contacting 95% of my customers and fired 2%, leaving me with the  top 3% of producers to profile and duplicate.  Out of more than 120 wholesale customers, a mere 5 were bring- ing in 95% of the revenue. I was spending 98% of my time chasing  the remainder, as the aforementioned 5 ordered regularly without any  follow-up calls, persuasion, or cajoling. In other words, I was  working because I felt as though I should be doing something from  9-5.1 didn't realize that working every hour from 9-5 isn't the goal;  it's simply the structure most people use, whether it's necessary or  not. I had a severe case of work-for-work (W4W), the most-hated  acronym in the NR vocabulary.  All, and I mean 100%, of my problems and complaints came  from  this unproductive majority, with the exception of two large customers  who were simply world-class experts of the "here is the fire I started,  now you put it out" approach to business. I put all of these  unproductive customers on passive mode: If they ordered, great—let  them fax in the order. If not, I would do absolutely no chasing: no  phone calls, no e-mail, nothing. That left the two larger customers to  deal with, who were professional ball breakers but contributed about  10% to the bottom line at the time.  You'll always have a few of these, and it is a quandary that causes  all sorts of problems, not the least of which are self-hatred and de- pression. Up to that point, I had taken their browbeating, insults,  time-consuming arguments, and tirades as a cost of doing business.  ======================================== [Página 83] ======================================== The End of Time Manage ment 71  I realized during the 80/20 analysis that these two people were the  source of nearly all my unhappiness and anger throughout the day,  and it usually spilled over into my personal time, keeping me up at  night with the usual "I should have said X, Y, and Z to that penis"  self-flagellation. I finally concluded the obvious: The effect on my  self-esteem  and state of mind just wasn't worth the financial gain. I  didn't need the money for any precise reason, and I had assumed I  needed to take it. The customers are always right, aren't they? Part of  doing business, right? Hell, no. Not for the NR, anyway. I fired their  asses and enjoyed every second of it. The first conversation went like  this:  Customer: What the &#@$? I ordered two cases and they arrived  two days late. [Note: He had sent the order to the wrong person  via the wrong medium, despite repeated reminders.] You guys  are the most disorganized bunch of idiots I've ever worked with.  I have 20 years of experience in this industry, and this is the  worst.  Any NR—in this case, me: I will kill you. Be afraid, be very afraid.  I wish. I did rehearse that a million times in my mental theater, but it  actually went something more like this:  I'm sorry to hear that. You know, I've been taking your insults  for a while now, and it's unfortunate that it seems we won't be  able to do business anymore. I'd recomme nd you take a good  look at where this unhappiness and anger is actually coming  from. In any case, I wish you well. If you would like to order  product, we'll be happy to supply it, but only if you can conduct  yourself without profanity and unnecessary insults. You have  our fax number. All the best and have a nice day. [Click.]  I did this once via phon e and once through e-mail. So what hap- pened? I lost one customer, but the other corrected course and  ======================================== [Página 84] ======================================== 72 STEP II: E IS FOR ELIMINATION  simply faxed orders, again and again and again. Problem solved,  minimum revenue lost. I was imme diately 10 times happier.  I then identified the common characteristics of my top-five cus- tomers and secured three or so similarly profiled buyers in the fol- lowing week. Remember, more customers is not automatically more  income. More customers is not the goal and often translates into 90%  more housekeeping and a paltry 1-3% increase in income. Make no  mistake, maximum income from minimal necessary effort (including  minimum number of customers) is the primary goal. I duplicated my  strengths, in this case my top producers, and focused on increasing  the size and frequency of their orders.  The end result? I went from chasing and appeasing 120 cus- tomers to simply receiving large orders from 8, with absolutely no  pleading phone calls or e-mail haranguing. My monthly income in- creased from $3oK to $6oK in four weeks and my weekly hours  imme diately dropped from over 80 to approximate ly 15. Most im- portant, I was happy with myself and felt both optimistic and liber- ated for the first time in over two years.  In the ensuing weeks, I applied the 80/20 Principle to dozens of  areas, including the following:  1. Advertising  I identified the advertising that was generating 80% or more of  revenue, identified the commonalities among them, and multi- plied them, eliminating all the rest at the same time. My advertis- ing costs dropped over 70% and my direct sales income nearly  doubled from a monthly $i5K to $25]$. in 8 weeks. It would have  doubled imme diately had I been using radio, newspapers, or  television instead of magazines with long lead times.  2. Online Affiliates and Partners  I fired more than 250 low-yield online affiliates or put them in  holding patterns to focus instead on the two affiliates who were  ======================================== [Página 85] ======================================== The End of Time Manage ment 73  generating 90% of the income. My management time decreased  from 5-10 hours per week to 1 hour per month. Online partner  income increased more than 50% in that same month.  Slow down and remember this: Most things make no difference.  Being busy is a form of laziness—lazy thinking and indiscriminate  action.  Being overwhelmed is often as unproductive as doing nothing,  and is far more unpleasant. Being selective—do ing less—is the path  of the productive. Focus on the important few and ignore the rest.  Of course, before you can separate the wheat from the chaff and  eliminate activities in a new environment (whether a new job or an  entrepreneurial venture), you will need to try a lot to identify what  pulls the most weight. Throw it all up on the wall and see what  sticks. That's part of the process, but it should not take more than a  month or two.  It's easy to get caught in a flood of minutiae, and the key to not  feeling rushed is remem bering that lack of time is actually lack of  priorities. Take time to stop and smell the roses, or—in this case— to  count the pea pods.  The 9-5 Illusion and Parkinsons Law  I saw a bank that said "24-Hour Banking," but I don't have  that much time. —STEVEN WRIGHT, comedian  f you're an employee, spending time on nonsense is, to some  extent, not your fault. There is often no incentive to use time well  unless you are paid on commission. The world has agreed to shuffle  papers between 9:00 A.M. and 5:00 P.M., and since you're trapped in  the office for that period of servitude, you are compelled to create  activities to fill that time. Time is wasted because there is so much  time available. It's understandable. Now that you have the new goal I  ======================================== [Página 86] ======================================== 74 STEP II: E IS FOR ELIMINATION  of negotiating a remote work arrangement instead of just collecting a  paycheck, it's time to revisit the status quo and become effective.  The best employees have the most leverage.  For the entrepreneur, the wasteful use of time is a matte r of bad  habit and imitation. I am no exception. Most entrepreneurs were  once employees and come from the 9-5 culture. Thus they adopt the  same schedule, whether or not they function at 9:00 A.M. or need 8  hours to generate their target income. This schedule is a collective  social agreeme nt and a dinosaur legacy of the results-by-volume  approach. How is it possible that all the people in the world need  exactly 8 hours to accomplish their work? It isn't. 9-5 is arbitrary.  You don't need 8 hours per day to become a legitimate  million- aire—let alone have the means to live like one. Eight hours per week  is often excessive, but I don't expect all of you to believe me just yet.  I know you probably feel as I did for a long time: There just aren't  enough hours in the day.  But let's consider a few things we can probably agree on.  Since we have 8 hours to fill, we fill 8 hours. If we had 15, we  would fill 15. If we have an emergency and need to suddenly leave  work in 2 hours but have pending deadlines, we miraculously com- plete those assignments in 2 hours.  It is all related to a law that was introduced to me by Ed Zschau  in the spring of 2000.   I had arrived to class nervous and unable to concentrate. The final  paper, worth a full 25% of the semester's grade, was due in 24 hours.  One of the options, and that which I had chosen, was to interview the  top executives of a start-up and provide an in-depth analysis of their  business model. The corporate powers that be had decided last  minute that I couldn't interview two key figures or use their  information due to confidentiality issues and pre-IPO precautions.  Game over.  I approached Ed after class to deliver the bad news.  "Ed, I think I'm going to need an extension on the paper." I  ======================================== [Página 87] ======================================== The End of Time Manage ment 75  explained the situation, and Ed smiled before he replied without so  much as a hint of concern.  "I think you'll be OK. Entrepreneurs are those who make things  happen, right?"  Twenty-four hours later and one minute before the deadline, as  his assistant was locking the office, I handed in a 30-page final paper.  It was based on a different company I had found, interviewed, and  dissected with an intense all-nighter and enough caffeine to get an  entire Olympic track team  disqualified. It ended up being one of the  best papers I'd written in four years, and I received an A.  Before I left the classroom the previous day, Ed had given me  some parting advice: Parkinson's Law.  Parkinson's Law dictates that a task will swell in (perceived)  importance and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its  completion. It is the magic of the imminent deadline. If I give you 24  hours to complete a project, the time pressure forces you to focus on  execution, and you have no choice but to do only the bare essentials.  If I give you a week to complete the same task, it's six days of  making a mountain out of a molehill. If I give you two months, God  forbid, it becomes a mental monster. The end product of the shorter  deadline is almost inevitably of equal or higher quality due to greater  focus.  This presents a very curious phenomenon. There are two syner- gistic approaches for increasing productivity that are inversions of  each other:  1. Limit tasks to the important to shorten work time (80/20).  2. Shorten work time to limit tasks to the important (Parkinson's  Law).  The best solution is to use both together: Identify the few critical  tasks that contribute most to income and schedule them with very  short and clear deadlines.  If you haven't identified the mission-critical tasks and set aggressive  ======================================== [Página 88] ======================================== 76 STEP  II: E IS FOR ELIMINATION  start and end times for their completion, the unimportant becomes  the important. Even if you know what's critical, without deadlines  that create focus, the minor tasks forced upon you (or invented, in  the case of the entrepreneur) will swell to consume time until another  bit of minutiae jumps in to replace it, leaving you at the end of the  day with nothing accomplished. How else could dropping off a  package at UPS, setting a few appointments, and checking e-mail  consume an entire 9-5 day? Don't feel bad. I spent months jumping  from one interruption to the next, feeling run by my business instead  of the other way around.  THE 80/20 PRINCIPLE and Parkinson's Law are the two cornerstone  concepts that will be revisited in different forms throughout this  entire section. Most inputs are useless and time is wasted in  proportion to the amount that is available.  Fat-free performance and time freedom begins with limiting in- take overload. In the next chapter, we'll put you on the real breakfast  of champions: the Low-Information Diet.

It was true. Can you eat All-Bran and chicken seven days a  week? Me neither. Don't be so judgmental.  Between my tenth and twelfth cupcakes, I plopped down on the couch to  revel in the sugar high until the clock struck midnight and sent me back to my  adultsville Sunday-Friday diet. There was another party guest seated next to me  on a chair, nursing a glass of wine, not  ======================================== [Página 89] ======================================== The End of Time Management 77  his twelfth but certainly not his first, and we struck up a conversation. As usual, I  had to struggle to answer "What do you do?" and, as usual, my answer left  someone to wonder whether I was a pathological liar or a criminal.  How was it possible to spend so little time on income generation? It's a good  question. It's THE question.  In almost all respects, Charney had it all. He was happily married with a two- year-old son and another due to arrive in three months. He was a successful  technology salesman, and though he wanted to earn $500 ,000 more per year as  all do, his finances were solid.  He also asked good questions. I had just returned from another trip overseas  and was planning a new adventure to Japan. He drilled me for two hours with a  refrain: How is it possible to spend so little time on income generation?  "If you're interested, we can make you a case study and I'll show you how," I  offered.  Charney was in. The one thing he didn't have was time.  One e-mail and five weeks of practice later, Charney had good news: He had  accomplished more in the last week than he had in the previous four combined.  He did so while taking Monday and Friday off and spending at least 2 more hours  per day with his family. From 40 hours per week, he was down to 18 and  producing four times the results.  Was it from mountaintop retreats and secret kung fu training? Nope. Was it a  new Japanese management secret or better software? Nein. I just asked him to  do one simple thing consistently without fail.  At least three times per day at scheduled times, he had to ask himself the  following question:  Am I being productive or just active?  Charney captured the essence of this with less-abstract wording:  Am I inventing things to do to avoid the important?  He eliminated all of the activities he used as crutches and began to focus on  demonstrating results instead of showing dedication. Dedication is often just  meaningless work in disguise. Be ruthless and cut the fat. It is possible to have your  cupcake and eat it, too.  ======================================== [Página 90] ======================================== 78 STEP II: E IS FOR ELIMINATION  «-Q&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS  We create stress for ourselves because you feel like you  have to do it. You have to. I don't feel that anymore. —OPRAH  WINFREY, actress and talk-show host, The Oprah Winfrey  Show  he key to having more time is doing less, and there are two paths  to getting there, both of which should be used together: (i)  Define a short to-do list and (2) define a not-to-do list. Here are  several hypothetical cases to help us get started:  1. If you had a heart attack and had to work two hours per day,  what would you do?  Not five hours, not four hours, not three—two hours. It's not  where I want you to ultimate ly be, but it's a start. Besides, I can  hear your brain bubbling already: That's ridiculous. Impossible! I  know, I know. If I told you that you could survive for months,  functioning quite well, on four hours of sleep per night, would  you believe me? Probably not. Notwithstanding, millions of new  mothers do it all the time. This exercise is not optional. The doc- tor has warned you, after triple bypass surgery, that if you don't  cut down your work to two hours per day for the first three  months post-op, you will die. How would you do it?  2. If you had a second heart attack and had to work two hours  per week, what would you do?  3. If you had a gun to yo ur head and had to stop doing 75 of dif- ferent time-consuming activities, what would you remove?  Simplicity requires ruthlessness. If you had to stop 4/s of time- consuming activities—e-mail, phone calls, conversations, pa- perwork, meet ings, advertising, customers, suppliers, products, T  ======================================== [Página 91] ======================================== The End of Time Manage ment 79  services, etc.—what would you eliminate to keep the negative  effect on income to a minimum? Used even once per month, this  question alone can keep you sane and on track.  4. What are the top-three activities that I use to fill time to feel  as though I've been productive?  These are usually used to postpone more important actions (often  uncomfortable because there is a chance of failure or rejection).  Be honest with yourself, as we all do this on occasion. What are  your crutch activities?  5. Learn to ask, "If this is the only thing I accomplish today, will  I be satisfied with my day?"  Don't ever arrive at the office or in front of your computer with- out a clear list of priorities. You'll just read unassociated e-mail  and scramble your brain for the day. Compile your to-do list for  tomorrow no later than this evening. I don't recomme nd using  Outlook or computerized to-do lists, because it is possible to add  an infinite number of items. I use a standard piece of paper folded  three times to about 2" x 3 yb", which fits perfectly in the pocket  and limits you to noting only a few items.  There should never be more than two mission-critical items to  complete each day. Never. It just isn't necessary if they're actually  high-impact. If you are stuck trying to decide between multiple  items that all seem crucial, as happens to all of us, look at each in  turn and ask yourself, "If this is the only thing I accomplish today,  will I be satisfied with my day?"  To counter the seemingly urgent, ask yourself, "What will  happen if I don't do this, and is it worth putting off the important  to do it?" If you haven't already accomplished at least one  important task in the day, don't spend the last business hour re- turning a DVD  to avoid a $5 late charge. Get the important task  done and pay the $5 fine.  ======================================== [Página 92] ======================================== 80 STEP II: E IS FOR ELIMINATION  6. Put a Post-it on your computer screen or set an Outlook reminder  to alert you at least three times daily with the question, "Are you  inventing things to do to avoid the important?"  7. Do not multitask.  I'm going to tell you what you already know. Trying to brush  your teeth, talk on the phone, and answer e-mail at the same time  just doesn't work. Eating while doing online research and instant  messaging? Ditto.  If you prioritize properly, there is no need to multitask. It is a  symptom of "task creep"—doing more to feel productive while  actually accomplishing less. To repeat: You should have, at most,  two primary goals or tasks per day. Do them separately from start  to finish without distraction. Divided attention will result in more  frequent interruptions, lapses in concentration, poorer net results,  and less gratification.  8. Use Parkinson's Law on a Macro and Micro Level.  Use Parkinson's Law to accomplish more in less time. Shorten  schedules and deadlines to force focused action and prevent  procrastination.  On a macro weekly and daily level, attem pt to leave work at 4  P.M. and take Monday and/or Friday off. This will focus you to  prioritize and quite possibly develop a social life. If you're under  the hawklike watch of a boss, we'll discuss the nuts and bolts of  how to escape in later chapters.  On a micro task level, limit the number of items on your to-do  list and use impossibly short deadlines to force immediate action  while ignoring minutiae.  ======================================== [Página 93] ======================================== The End of Time Manage ment 81  -COMFORT CHALLENGE  Learn to Propose (2 Days)  Stop asking for opinions and start proposing solutions. Begin with  the small things. If someone is going to ask, or asks, "Where should  we eat?" "What movie should we watch?" "What should we do  tonight?" or anything similar, do NOT reflect it back with, "Well,  what do you want to ... ?" Offer a solution. Stop the back-and-forth  and make a decision. Practice this in both personal and professional  environments. Here are a few lines that help (my favorites are the  first and last):  "Can I make a suggestion?"  "I propose ..."  "I'd like to propose ..."  "I suggest that... What do you think?"  "Let's try ... and then try something else if that doesn't work."  ======================================== [Página 94] ======================================== G   The Low-Information Diet  -CULTIVATING SELECTIVE IGNORANCE   What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the  attention of its recipients. Hence, a wealth of information  creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that  attention efficiently among the overabundance of information  sources that might consume it. —H ERB ERT SIMON, recipient of  Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics7 and the A.M. Turing  Award, the "Nobel Prize of Computer Science"  Reading, after a certain age, diverts the mind too much from  its creative pursuits. Any man who reads too much and uses  his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking.  —ALBERT EINSTEIN  JL hope you're sitting down. Take that sandwich out of your mouth so  you don't choke. Cover the baby's ears. I'm going to tell you something that  upsets a lot of people.  I never watch the news and have bought one single newspaper in the last  five years, in Stansted Airport in London , and only because it gave me a  discount on a Diet Pepsi.  I would claim to be Amish, but last time I checked, Pepsi wasn't on the  menu.  7. Simon received the Nobel Prize in 1978  for his contribution to organizational  decision making: It is impossible to have perfect and complete information at any  given time to make a decision.  ======================================== [Página 95] ======================================== The Low-Information Diet 83  How obscene! I call myself an informed and responsible citizen?  How do I stay up-to-date with current affairs? I'll answer all of that,  but wait—it gets better. I check business e-mail for about an hour  each Monday, and I never check voicemail  when abroad. Never ever.  But what if someone has an emergency? It doesn't happen. My  contacts now know that I don't respond to emergencies, so the  emergencies somehow don't exist or don't come to me. Problems, as  a rule, solve themselves or disappear if you remove yourself as an in- formation bottleneck and empower others.  Cultivating Selective Ignorance  There are many things of which a wise man might wish to  be ignorant. —RALPH WALDO EMERSON (1803-1882)  rom this point forward, I'm going to propose that you develop an  uncanny ability to be selectively ignorant. Ignorance may be  bliss, but it is also practical. It is imperative that you learn to ignore  or redirect all information and interruptions that are irrelevant,  unimportant, or unactionable. Most are all three.  The first step is to develop and maintain a low-information diet.  Just as modern man consumes both too many calories and calories of  no nutritional value, information workers eat data both in excess and  from the wrong sources.  Lifestyle design is based on massive action—ou tput. Increased  output necessitates decreased input. Most information is time- consuming, negative, irrelevant to your goals, and outside of your  influence. I challenge you to look at whatever you read or watched  today and tell me that it wasn't at least two of the four.  I read the front-page headlines through the newspaper machines  as I walk to lunch each day and nothing more. In five years, I haven't  had a single problem due to this selective ignorance. It gives you  something new to ask the rest of the population in lieu of small talk: F  ======================================== [Página 96] ======================================== 84 STEP II: E IS FOR ELIMINATION  "Tell me, what's new in the world?" And, if it's that important, you'll  hear people talking about it. Using my crib notes approach to world  affairs, I also retain more than someone who loses the forest for the  trees in a sea of extraneous details.  From an actionable information standpoint, I consume a maxi- mum of one-third of one industry magazine (Response magazine)  and one business magazine (Inc.) per month, for a grand total of ap- proximate ly four hours. That's it for results-oriented reading. I read  an hour of fiction prior to bed for relaxation.  How on earth do I act responsibly? Let me give an example of  how I and other NR both consider and obtain information. I voted in  the last presidential election, despite having been in Berlin. I made  my decision in a matte r of hours. First, I sent e-mails to educated  friends in the United States who share my values and asked them  who they were voting for and why. Second, I judge people based on  actions and not words; thus, I asked friends in Berlin, who had more  perspective outside of U.S. media propaganda, how they judged the  candidates based on their historical behavior. Last, I watched the  presidential debates. That was it. I let other dependable people syn- thesize hundreds of hours and thousands of pages of media for me. It  was like having dozens of personal information assistants, and I  didn't have to pay them a single cent.  That's a simple example, you say, but what if you need to learn to  do something your friends haven't done? Like, say, sell a book to the  world's largest publisher as a first-time author? Funny you should  ask. There are two approaches I used:  1. I picked one book out of dozens based on reader reviews and  the fact that the authors had actually done what I wanted to do. If  the task is how-to in nature, I only read accounts that are "how I  did it" and autobiographical. No speculators or wannabes are  worth the time.  2. Using the book to generate intelligent and specific questions,  ======================================== [Página 97] ======================================== The Low-Information Diet 85  I contacted 10 of the top authors and agents in the world via e- mail and phone, with a response rate of 80%.  I only read the sections of the book that were relevant to imme di- ate next steps, which took less than two hours. To develop a template  e-mail and call script took approximate ly four hours, and the actual  e-mails and phone calls took less than an hour. This personal contact  approach is not only more effective and more efficient than all-you- can-eat info buffets, it also provided me with the major league  alliances and mentors necessary to sell this book. Rediscover the  power of the forgotten skill called "talking." It works.  Once again, less is more.  How to Read  200% Faster in 10 Minutes  here will be times when, it's true, you will have to read. Here are four simple tips  that will lessen the damage and increase your speed at least 200% in 10 minutes  with no comprehension loss:  1. Two Minutes: Use a pen or finger to trace under each line as you  read as fast as poss ible. Reading is a series of jumping snapshots (called  saccades), and using a visual guide prevents regression.  2. Three Minutes: Begin each line focusing on the third word in from  the first word, and end each line focusing on the third word in from the  last word. This makes use of peripheral vision that is otherwise wasted on  margins. For example, even when the highlighted words in the next line are  your beginning and ending focal points, the entire sentence is "read," just  with less eye movement:  "Once upon a time, an information addict decided to detox."  Move in from both sides further and further as it gets easier. T  ======================================== [Página 98] ======================================== 86 STEP  II: E IS FOR ELIMINATION  3. Two Minutes: Once comfortable indenting three or four words from  both sides, attempt to take only two snapshots—also known as  fixations—per line on the first and last indented words.  4. Three Minutes: Practice reading too fast for comprehension but  with good  technique (the above  three techniques) for five pages prior  to reading at a comfortable speed . This will heighten perception and reset  your speed limit, much like how 50 mph normally feels fast but seems like  slow motion if you drop down from 70 mph on the freeway.  To calculate reading speed in words per minute (wpm)—and thus progress— in a given book, add up the number of words in ten lines and divide by ten to get  the average words per line. Multiply this by the number of lines per page and you  have the average words per page. Now it's simple. If you initially read 1.25 pages  in one minute at 330 average words per page, that's 412.5 words per minute. If  you then read 3.5 pages after training, it's 1,155 words per minute and you're in  the top 1% of the world's fastest readers.8  8.

SAWYER, Calculating God  I.   Go on an imme diate one-week media fast.  The world doesn't even hiccup, much less end, when you cut the  information umbilical cord. To realize this, it's best to use the  Band-Aid approach and do it quickly: a one-week media fast.  Information is too much like ice cream to do otherwise. "Oh, I'll  just have a half a spoonful" is about as realistic as "I just want to  jump online for a minute." Go cold turkey.  ======================================== [Página 99] ======================================== The Low-Information Diet 87  If you want to go back to the 15,000-calorie potato chip infor- mation diet afterward, fine, but beginning tomorrow and for at  least five full days, here are the rules:  No newspapers, magazines, audiobooks, or nonmusic radio.  Music is permitted at all times. No news websites  whatsoever (cnn.com, drudgereport.com,  msn.com, etc.). No television at all, except for one hour of  pleasure viewing  each evening. No reading book s, except for this book and  one hour of  fiction9 pleasure reading prior to bed. No Web  surfing at the desk unless it is necessary to  complete a work task for that day. Necessary means  necessary, not nice to have.  Unnecessary reading is public enemy number one during this  one-week fast.  What do you do with all the extra time? Replace the news- paper at breakfast with speaking to your spouse, bonding with  your children, or learning the principles in this book. Between 9- 5, complete your top priorities as per the last chapter. If you  complete them with time to spare, do the exercises in this book.  Recomme nding this book might seem hypocritical, but it's not:  The information in these pages is both important and to be  applied now, not tomorrow or the day after. Each day at lunch  break, and no earlier, get your five-minute fix.  Ask a well-informed colleague or a restaurant waiter, "Any- thing important happening in the world today? I couldn't get the  paper today." Stop this as soon as you realize that the answer  9. As someone who read exclusively nonfiction for nearly 15 years, I can tell you two  things: It's not productive to read two fact-based books at the same time (this is one),  and fiction is better than sleeping pills for putting the happenings of the day behind  you.  ======================================== [Página 100] ======================================== 88 STEP II: E IS FOR ELIMINATION  doesn't affect your actions at all. Most people won't even remem- ber what they spent one to two hours absorbing that morning. Be  strict with yourself. I can prescribe the medicine, but you need to  take it.  2. Develop the habit of asking yourself, "Will I definitely use  this information for something imme diate and important?"  It's not enough to use information for "something"—it needs to be  imme diate and important. If "no" on either count, don't consume  it. Information is useless if it is not applied to something  important or if you will forget it before you have a chance to  apply it.  I used to have the habit of reading a book or site to prepare for  an event weeks or months in the future, and I would then need to  reread the same mate rial when the deadline for action was closer.  This is stupid and redundant. Follow your to-do short list and fill  in the information gaps as you go.  3. Practice the art of nonfinishing.  This is another one that took me a long time to learn. Starting  something doesn't automatically justify finishing it.  If you are reading an article that sucks, put it down and don't  pick it back up. If you go to a movie and it's worse than The  Matrix Revolutions, get the hell out of there before more neurons  die. If you're full after half a plate of ribs, put the damn fork down  and don't order dessert.  More is not better, and stopping something is often 10 times  better than finishing it. Develop the habit of nonfinishing that  which is boring or unproductive if a boss isn't demanding it.  ======================================== [Página 101] ======================================== The Low-Information Diet gg  -COMFORT CHALLENGE  Get Phone  Numbers (2 Days)  Being sure to maintain eye contact, ask for the phone numbers of at  least two (the more you attem pt, the less stressful it will be) attractive  members of the opposite sex on each day. Ladies, this means you're  in the game as well, and it doesn't matte r if you're 50 years old or  older. Remem ber that the real goal is not to get numbers, but to get  over the fear of asking, so the outcome is unimportant. If you're in a  relationship, just toss the numbers if you get them.  Go to a mall if you want to get some rapid-fire practice—my  preference for getting over the discomfort quickly—and aim to ask  three people in a row within five minutes. Feel free to use some varia- tion of the following script:  "Excuse me. I know this is going to sound strange, but if I don't  ask you now, I'll be kicking myself for the rest of the day. I'm running  to meet  a friend [i.e., I have friends and am not a stalker], but I think  you're really [extremely, drop-dead] cute [gorgeous, hot]. Could I  have your phone number? I'm not a psycho—I promise. You can  give me a fake one if you're not interested."  ======================================== [Página 102] ======================================== o   Interrupting Interruption and the  Art of Refusal   Do your own thinking independently. Be the chess player,  not the chess piece. —RAL PH CHARELL  Meetings are an addictive, highly self-indulgent activity that  corporations and other organizations habitually engage in only  because they cannot actually masturbate. —DAVE BARRY, Pulitzer  Prize-winning American humorist  SPRING 2000 , PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY  1:35 P.M.  "I think I understand. Moving on. In the next paragraph, it explains that..." I  had detailed notes and didn't want to miss a single point.  3:45 P.M.  "OK. That makes sense, but if we look at the following example..." I paused  for a moment mid-sentence. The teaching assistant had both hands on his  face.  "Tim, let's end here for now. I'll be sure to keep these points in mind."  He had had enough. Me too, but I knew I'd only have to do it once.  or all four years of school, I had a policy. If I received anything less  than an A on the first paper or non-multiple-choice test in a F  ======================================== [Página 103] ======================================== Interrupting Interruption and the Art of Refusal 91  given class, I would bring 2-3 hours of questions to the grader's  office hours and not leave until the other had answered them all or  stopped out of exhaustion.  This served two important purposes:  1. I learned exactly how the grader evaluated work, including his  or her prejudices and pet peeves.  2. The grader would think long and hard about ever giving me  less than an A. He or she would never consider giving me a  bad grade without exceptional reasons for doing so, as he or  she knew I'd come a'knocking for another three-hour visit.  Learn to be difficult when it counts. In school as in life, having a  reputation for being assertive will help you receive preferential  treatme nt without having to beg or fight for it every time.   Think back to your days on the playground. There was always a  big bully and countless victims, but there was also that one small kid  who fought like hell, thrashing and swinging for the fences. He or  she might not have won, but after one or two exhausting exchanges,  the bully chose not to bother him or her. It was easier to find some- one else.  Be that kid.  Doing the important and ignoring the trivial is hard because so  much of the world seems to conspire to force crap upon you. Fortu- nately, a few simple routine changes make bothering you much more  painful than leaving you in peace.   It's time to stop taking information abuse.  Not All Evils Are Created Equal  or our purposes, an interruption is anything that prevents the start- to-finish completion of a critical task, and there are three  principal offenders: F  ======================================== [Página 104] ======================================== 92 STEP II: E IS FOR ELIMINATION  i. Time wasters: those things that can be ignored with little or no  consequence. Common time wasters include meet ings,  discussions, phone calls, and e-mail that are unimportant.  2. Time consumers: repetitive tasks or requests that need to be  completed but often interrupt high-level work. Here are a few  you might know intimate ly: reading and responding to e-mail,  making and returning phone calls, customer service (order  status, product assistance, etc.), financial or sales reporting,  personal errands, all necessary repeated actions and tasks.  3. Empowerment failures: instances where someone needs ap- proval to make something small happen. Here are just a few:  fixing customer problems (lost shipments, damaged ship- ments, malfunctions, etc.), customer contact, cash expendi- tures of all types.  Let's look at the prescriptions for all three in turn.  Time Wasters: Become an Ignoramus  The best defense is a good offense.  —DAN GABLE, Olympic gold medalist in wrestling and the most  successful coach in history; personal record: 299-6-3, with 182 pins  ime wasters are the easiest to eliminate and deflect. It is a matte r  of limiting access and funneling all communication toward im- mediate action.  First, limit e-mail consumption and production. This is the great- est single interruption in the modern world.  1. Turn off the audible alert if you have one on Outlook or a  similar program and turn off automatic send/receive, which de- livers e-mail to your inbox as soon as someone sends them. T  ======================================== [Página 105] ======================================== Interrupting Interruption and the Art of Refusal 93  2. Check e-mail twice per day, once at 12:00 noon or just prior to  lunch, and again at 4:00 P.M. 12:00 P.M. and 4:00 P.M. are times  that ensure you will have the most responses from previously sent  e-mail. Never check e-mail first thing in the morning.10 Instead,  complete your most important task before 11:00 A.M. to avoid  using lunch or reading e-mail as a postponement excuse.  Before implementing the twice-daily routine, you must create an  e-mail autoresponse that will train your boss, co-workers, suppliers,  and clients to be more effective. I would recomme nd that you do not  ask to implement this. Remember one of our ten comma ndments:  Beg for forgiveness; don't ask for permission.  If this gives you heart palpitations, speak with your imme diate  supervisor and propose to trial the approach for one to three days.  Cite pending projects and frustration with constant interruptions as  the reasons. Feel free to blame  it on spam or someone outside of the  office.  Here is a simple e-mail template that can be used:  Greetings, Friends [or Esteemed Colleague s],  Due to high workload, I am currently checking and  respond ing to e-mail twice daily at 12:00 P.M. ET [or your time  zone] and 4:00 P.M. ET.  If you require urgent assistance (please ensure it is urgent)  that cannot wait until either 12:00 P.M. or 4:00 P.M., please  contact me via phone at 555-555-5555.  Thank you for understanding this move to more effi- ciency and effectiveness. It helps me accomplish more to  serve you better.  Sincerely,  Tim Ferriss  10. This habit alone  can change  your life. It seems small but has an enormous  effect.  ======================================== [Página 106] ======================================== 94 STEP II: E IS FOR ELIMINATION  MOVE TO ONCE-PER-DAY as quickly as possible. Emergencies are  seldom that. People are poor judges of importance and inflate minu- tiae to fill time and feel important. This autoresponse is a tool that,  far from decreasing collective effectiveness, forces people to re- evaluate their reason for interrupting you and helps them decrease  meaningless and time-consuming contact.  I was initially terrified of missing important requests and inviting  disaster, just as you might be upon reading this recomme ndation.  Nothing happened. Give it a shot and work out the small bumps as  you progress.  For an extreme example of a personal autoresponder that has  never prompted a complaint and allows me to check e-mail once per  week, send an e-mail to timothy@brainquicken.com. It has been  revised over three years and works like a charm.  The second step is to screen incoming and limit outgoing phone  calls.  1. Use two telephone numbers if possible—one office line (non- urgent) and one cellular (urgent). This could also be two cell  phones, or the non-urgent line could be an Internet phon e number  that routes calls to online voicemai l (www .skype.com, for  example).  Use the cell number in the e-mail autoresponse and answer it  at all times unless it is an unidentified caller or it is a call you  don't want to answer. If in doubt, allow the call to go to voicema il  and listen to the voicema il imme diately afterward to gauge im- portance. If it can wait, let it wait. The offending parties have to  learn to wait.  The office phone should be put on silent mode and allowed to  go to voicema il at all times. The voicema il recording should  sound familiar:  ======================================== [Página 107] ======================================== Interrupting Interruption and the Art of Refusal 95  You've reached the desk of Tim Ferriss.  I am currently checking and respond ing to voicemail twice  daily at 12:00 P.M. ET [or your time zone] and 4:00 P.M. ET.  If you require assistance with a truly urgent matter that cannot wait  until either 12:00 P.M. or 4:00 P.M., please contact me on my cell at  555-555-5555. Otherwise, please leave a message and I will return it  at the next of those two times. Be sure to leave your e-mail address,  as I am often able to respond faster that way.  Thank you for understanding this move to more efficiency and  effectiveness. It helps me accomplish more to serve you better.  Have a wonde rful day.  2. If someone does call your cell phone, it is presumably urgent and  should be treated as such. Do not allow them to consume time  otherwise. It's all in the greeting. Compare the following:  Jane (receiver): Hello? John  (caller): Hi, is this Jane? Jane:  This is Jane. John: Hi, Jane, it's  John.  Jane:  Oh, hi, John. How are you? (or) Oh, hi, John. What's going  on?  John will now digress and lead you into a conversation about nothing,  from which you will have to recover and then fish out the ultimate  purpose of the call. There is a better approach:  Jane: This is Jane speaking. John:   Hi, it's John.  Jane: Hi, John. I'm right in the middle of something. How can I help  you out?  Potential continuation:  John: Oh, I can call back.  Jane: No, I have a minute. What can I do for you?  ======================================== [Página 108] ======================================== 96 STEP II: E IS FOR ELIMINATION  Don't encourage people to chitchat and don't let them chitchat.  Get them to the point imme diately. If they meander or try to  postpone for a later undefined call, reel them in and get them to  come to the point. If they go into a long description of a problem,  cut in with, "[Name], sorry to interrupt, but I have a call in five  minutes. What can I do to help out?" You might instead say,  "[Name], sorry to interrupt, but I have a call in five minutes. Can  you send me an e-mail?"  The third step is to master the art of refusal and avoiding  meetings.  THE FIRST DAY our new Sales VP arrived at TrueSAN in 2001,  he  came  into the all-company meet ing and made an announceme nt in  just about this many words: "I am not here to make friends. I have  been hired to build a sales team  and sell product, and that's what I  intend to do. Thanks." So much for small talk.  He proceeded to deliver on his promise. The office socializers  disliked him for his no-nonsense approach to communication, but  everyone respected his time. He wasn't rude without reason, but he  was direct and kept the people around him focused. Some didn't  consider him charismatic , but no one considered him anything less  than spectac ularly effective.  I remember sitting down in his office for our first one-on-one  meet ing. Fresh off four years of rigorous academic training, I imme- diately jumped into explaining the prospect profiles, elaborate plan- ning I'd developed, responses to date, and so forth and so on. I had  spent at least two hours preparing to make this first impression a  good one. He listened with a smile on his face for no more than two  minutes and then held up a hand. I stopped. He laughed in a kind- hearted manner and said, "Tim, I don't want the story. Just tell me  what we need to do."  Over the following weeks, he trained me to recognize when I  ======================================== [Página 109] ======================================== Interrupting Interruption and the Art of Refusal 97  Was unfocused or focused on the wrong things, which meant any- thing that didn't move the top two or three clients one step closer to  signing a purchase order. Our meetings were now no more than five  minutes long.  From this moment forward, resolve to keep those around you  focused and avoid all meeti ngs, whether in person or remote, that do  not have clear objectives. It is possible to do this tactfully, but expect  that some time wasters will be offended the first few times their  advances are rejected. Once it is clear that remaining on task is your  policy and not subject to change, they will accept it and move on  with life. Hard feelings pass. Don't suffer fools or you'll become one.  It is your job to train those around  you to be effective and efficient.  No one else will do it for you. Here are a few recomme ndations:  1. Decide that, given the non-urgent nature of most issues, you  will steer people toward the following means of communication,  in order of preference: e-mail, phone, and in-person meet ings. If  someone proposes a meeting, request an e-mail instead and then  use the phone as your fallback offer if need be. Cite other imme  diately pending work tasks as the reason.  2. Respond to voicema il via e-mail whenever possible. This  trains people to be concise. Help them develop the habit.  Similar to our opening greeting on the phone, e-mail com- munication should be streamlined to prevent needless back-and- forth. Thus, an e-mail with "Can you meet  at 4:00 P.M.?" would  become "Can you meet  at 4:00 P.M.? If SO__If not, please advise  three other times that work for you."  This "if. .. then" structure becomes more important as you  check e-mail less often. Since I only check e-mail once a week, it  is critical that no one needs a "what if?" answered or other infor- mation within seven days of a given e-mail I send. If I suspect  ======================================== [Página 110] ======================================== STEP II: E IS FOR ELIMINATION  that a manufacturing order hasn't arrived at the shipping facility,  for example, I'll send an e-mail to my shipping facility manager  along these lines: "Dear Susan . . . Has the new manufacturing  shipment arrived? If so, please advise me on ... If not, please  contact John Doe at 555-5555  or via e-mail at john@doe.com (he  is also CC'd) and advise on delivery date and tracking. John, if  there are any issues with the shipment, please coordinate with  Susan, reachable at 555-4444,  who has the authority to make  decisions up to $500 on my behalf. In case of emergency, call me  on my cell phone, but I trust you two. Thanks." This prevents  most follow-up questions, avoids two separate dialogues, and  takes me out of the problem-solving equation.  Get into the habit of considering what "if. . . then" actions can  be proposed in any e-mail where you ask a question.  3. Meetings should only be held to make decisions about a pre- defined situation, not to define the problem. If someone proposes  that you meet  with them or "set a time to talk on the phone," ask  that person to send you an e-mail with an agenda to define the  purpose:  That sound s doable . So I can best prepare, can you please send  me an e-mail with an agenda? That is, the topics and questions  we'll need  to address? That would be great. Thanks in advance.  Don't give them a chance to bail out. The "thanks in advance"  before a retort increases your chances of getting the e-mail.  The e-mail medium forces people to define the desired out- come of a meet ing or call. Nine times out of ten, a meet ing is  unnecessary and you can answer the questions, once defined, via  e-mail. Impose this habit on others. I haven't had an in-person  meet ing for my business in more than five years and have had  fewer than a dozen conference calls, all lasting less than 30  minutes.  ======================================== [Página 111] ======================================== Interrupting Interruption and the Art of Refusal 99   4. Speaking of 30 minutes, if you absolutely cannot stop a meet- ing or call from happening, define the end time. Do not leave  these discussions open-ended, and keep them short. If things are  well-defined, decisions should not take more than 30 minutes.  Cite other commitments at odd times to make them more believ- able (e.g., 3:20 vs. 3:30) and force people to focus instead of  socializing, commiserating, and digressing. If you must join a  meet ing that is scheduled to last a long time or that is open-ended,  inform the organizer that you would like permission to cover your  portion first, as you have a commitment in 15 minutes. If you  have to, feign an urgent phone call. Get the hell out of there and  have someone else update you later. The other option is to be  completely transparent and voice your opinion of how  unnecessary the meet ing is. If you choose this route, be prepared  to face fire and offer alternatives.  5. The cubicle is your temple—don't permit casual visitors. Some  suggest using a clear "DO NOT DISTURB" sign of some type, but I  have found that this is ignored unless you have an office. My  approach was to put headphon es on, even if I wasn't listening to  anything. If someone approached me despite this discouragement,  I would pretend to be on the phone. I'd put a finger to my lips, say  something like, "I hear you," and then say into the mic, "Can you  hold on a second?" Next, I'd turn to the invader and say, "Hi.  What can I do for you?" I wouldn't let them "get back to me" but  rather force the person to give me a five-second summa ry and  then send me an e-mail if necessary.  If headphone games aren't your thing, the reflexive response  to an invader should be the same as when answering the cell  phone: "Hi, invader. I'm right in the middle of something. How  can I be of help?" If it's not clear within 30 seconds, ask the per- son to send you an e-mail about the chosen issue; do not offer to  send them an e-mail first: "I'll be happy to help, but I have to  ======================================== [Página 112] ======================================== 100 STEP II: E IS FOR ELIMINATION  finish this first. Can you send me a quick e-mail to remind me?"  If you still cannot deflect an invader, give the person a time limit  on your availability, which can also be used for phone conversa- tions: "OK, I only have two minutes before a call, but what's the  situation and what can I do to help?"  6. Use the Puppy Dog Close to help your superiors and others  develop the no-meet ing habit. The Puppy Dog Close in sales is so  named because it is based on the pet store sales approach: If  someone likes a puppy but is hesitant to make the life-altering  purchase, just offer to let them take the pup home and bring it  back if they change their minds. Of course, the return seldom  happens.  The Puppy Dog Close is invaluable whenever you face resis- tance to permanent changes. Get your foot in the door with a  "let's just try it once" reversible trial.  Compare the following:  "I think you'd love this puppy. It will forever add to your re- sponsibilities until he dies 10 years from now. No more care-free  vacations, and you'll finally get to pick up poop all over the city— what do you think?"  vs.  "I think you'd love this puppy. Why don't you just take him home  and see what you think? You can just bring him back if you  change your mind."  Now imagine walking up to your boss in the hallway and  clapping a hand on her shoulder:  "I'd like to go to the meeting, but I have a better idea. Let's never  have another one, since all we do is waste time and not decide  anything useful."  vs.  ======================================== [Página 113] ======================================== Interrupting Interruption and the Art of Refusal 101  "I'd really like to go to the meeting, but I'm totally overwhelmed  and really need  to get a few important things done. Can I sit out  just for today? I'd be distracted in the meeting otherwise. I  promise I'll catch up afterward by reviewing the meeting with  Colleague X. Is that OK?"  The second set of alternatives seem less permanent, and  they're intended to appear so. Repeat this routine and ensure that  you achieve more outside of the meet ing than the attendees do  within it; repeat the disappearing act as often as possible and cite  improved productivity to convert this slowly into a permanent  routine change.  Learn to imitate any good child: "Just this once! Please!!! I  promise I'll do X!" Parents fall for it because kids help adults to  fool themselves. It works with bosses, suppliers, customers, and  the rest of the world, too.  Use it, but don't fall for it. If a boss asks for overtime "just this  once," he or she will expect it in the future.  Time Consumers: Batch and Do Not Falter  A schedule defends from chaos and whim. — ANNIE DILLARD, winner of Pulitzer Prize in  nonfiction, 1975   f you have never used a comme rcial printer before, the pricing and  lead times could surprise you.  Let's assume it costs $310 and takes one week to print 20 customized  T-shirts with 4-color logos. How much and how long does it take to  print 3 of the same T-shirt? $310  and one week.  How is that possible? Simple—the setup charges don't change. It  costs the printer the same amount in mate rials for plate preparation  ($150) and the same in labor to man the press itself ($100). The I  ======================================== [Página 114] ======================================== 102 STEP  II: E IS FOR ELIMINATION  setup is the real time-consumer, and thus the job, despite its small  size, needs to be scheduled just like the other, resulting in the same  one-week delivery date. The lower economy of scale picks up the  rest: The cost for 3 shirts is $20 per shirt x 3 shirts instead of $3 per  shirt x 20 shirts.  The cost- and time-effective solution, therefore, is to wait until  you have a larger order, an approach called "batching." Batching is  also the solution to our distracting but necessary time consumers,  those repetitive tasks that interrupt the most important.  If you check mail and make bill payments five times a week, it  might take 30 minutes per instance and you respond to a total of 20  letters. If you do this once per week instead, it might take 60 minutes  total and you still respond to a total of 20 letters in two and a half  hours. People do the former out of fear of emergencies. First, there  are seldom real emergencies. Second, of the urgent communication  you will receive, missing a deadline is usually reversible and  otherwise costs a minimum to correct.  There is an inescapable setup time for all tasks, large or minuscule  in scale. It is often the same for one as it is for a hundred. There is a  psychological switching of gears that can require up to 45 minutes to  resume a major task that has been interrupted. More than a quarter of  each 9-5 period (28%) is consumed by such interruptions.11  This is true of all recurring tasks and is precisely why we have al- ready decided to check e-mail and phone calls twice per day at spe- cific predetermined times (between which we let them accumulate).  For the last three years, I have checked mail no more than once a  week, often not for up to four weeks at a time. Nothing has been  irreparable, and nothing has cost more than $300  to fix. This batch- ing has saved me hundreds of hours of redundant work. How much is  your time worth?  11. The Cost of Not Paying Attention: How Interruptions Impact Knowledge  Worker  Productivity, Jonathan B. Spira and Joshua B. Feintuch, Basex, 2005.   ======================================== [Página 115] ======================================== Interrupting Interruption and the Art of Refusal 103  Let's use a hypothetical example:  1. $20 per hour is how much you are paid or value your time.  This would be the case, for example, if you are paid $40,000  per  year and get two weeks of vacation per year ($40, 000 divided by  [40 hours per week x 50 = 2,000]  = $2o/hour).  2. Estimate  the amount of time you will save by grouping similar  tasks together and batching them, and calculate how much you  have earned by multiplying this hour number by your per-hour  rate ($20 here):  1 x per week: 10 hours = $200  1 x p er two weeks:    20 hours = $400  1 x per month: 40 hours = $800  3. Test each of the above batching frequencies and determine  how much problems cost to fix in each period. If the cost is less  than the above dollar amounts, batch even further apart.  For example, using our above math, if I check e-mail once per  week and that results in an average loss of two sales per week, to- taling $80 in lost profit, I will continue checking once per week  because $200 (10 hours of time) minus $80 is still a $120 net  gain, not to mention the enormous benefits of completing other  main tasks in those 10 hours. If you calculate the financial and  emotional benefit of completing just one main task (such as  landing a major client or completing a life-changing trip), the  value of batching is much more than the per-hour savings.  If the problems cost more than hours saved, scale back to the  next-less-frequent batch schedule. In this case, I would drop from  once per week to twice per week (not daily) and attem pt to fix the  system so that I can return to once per week. Do not work harder  when the solution is working smarter. I have batched both  personal and business tasks further and further apart as I've  realized just how few real problems come up. Some of my  ======================================== [Página 116] ======================================== 104 STEP II: E IS FOR ELIMINATION  current batches are as follows: e-mail (Mondays 10:00 A.M.), phone  (completely eliminated), laundry (every other Sunday at 10:00 P.M.),  credit cards and bills (most are on automatic payment, but I check  balances every second Monday after e-mail), strength training (every  4th day for 30 minutes), etc.  Empowerment Failure: Rules and Readjustment  The vision is really about empowering workers, giving them all  the information about what's going on so they can do a lot more  than they've done in the past. —BILL GATES, cofounder of  Microsoft, richest man in the world  mpowerment failure refers to being unable to accomplish a task without  first obtaining permission or information. It is often a case of being  micromanaged or micromanaging someone else, both of which consume  your time.  For the employee, the goal is to have full access to necessary in- formation and as much independent decision-making ability as possible. For  the entrepreneur, the goal is to grant as much information and independent  decision-making ability to employees or contractors as possible.  Customer service is often the epitome of empowerment failure, and a  personal example from BrainQUICKEN illustrates just how serious but  easily solved the problem can be.  In 2002 , I had outsourced customer service for order tracking and  returns but still handled product-related questions myself. The result? I  received more than 200 e-mail per day, spending all hours between 9-5  responding to them, and the volume was growing at a rate of more than  10% per week! I had to cancel advertising and limit shipments, as additional  customer service would have been the final E ======================================== [Página 117] ======================================== Interrupting Interruption and the Art of Refusal 105  nail in the coffin. It wasn't a scalable model. Remem ber this word, as  it will be important later. It wasn't scalable because there was an in- formation and decision bottleneck: me.  The clincher? The bulk of the e-mail that landed in my inbox was  not product-related at all but requests from the outsourced customer  service reps seeking permission for different actions:  The customer claims he didn't receive the shipment. What  should we do? The customer had a bottle held at customs.  Can we reship to a  U.S. address? The customer needs the product for a  competition in two days.  Can we ship overnight, and if so, how much should we  charge?  It was endless. Hundreds upon hundreds of different situations made  it impractical to write a manual, and I didn't have the time or  experience to do so regardless.  Fortunately, someone did have the experience: the outsourced  reps themselves. I sent one single e-mail to all the supervisors that  imme diately turned 200 e-mail per day into fewer than 20 e-mail per  week:  Hi All,  I would like to establish a new policy for my account that  overrides all others.  Keep the customer happy. If it is a problem that takes less  than $100 to fix, use your judgment and fix it yourself.  This is official written permission and a request to fix all  problems that cost unde r $100 without contacting me. I am no  longe r your customer; my customers are your customer. Don't  ask me for permission. Do what you think is right, and we'll  make adjustments as we go along.  Thank you,  Tim  ======================================== [Página 118] ======================================== 106 STEP II: E IS FOR ELIMINATION  Upon close analysis, it became  clear that more than 90% of the  issues that prompted e-mail could be resolved for less than $20.1  re- viewed the financial results of their independent decision-making on  a weekly basis for four weeks, then a monthly basis, and then on a  quarterly basis.  It's amazing how someone's IQ seems to double as soon as you  give them responsibility and indicate that you trust them. The first  month cost perhaps $200  more than if I had been micromanaging. In  the meantime, I saved more than 100 hours of my own time per  month, customers received faster service, returns dropped to less than  3% (the industry average is 10-15%), and outsourcers spent less time  on my account, all of which resulted in rapid growth, higher profit  margins, and happier people on all sides.  People are smarter than you think. Give them a chance to prove  themselves.  If you are a micromanaged employee, have a heart-to-heart with  your boss and explain that you want to be more productive and in- terrupt him or her less. "I hate that I have to interrupt you so much  and pull you away from more important things I know you have on  your plate. I was doing some reading and had some thoughts on how  I might be more productive. Do you have a second?"  Before this conversation, develop a number of "rules" like the  previous example that would allow you to work more autonomously  with less approval-seeking. The boss can review the outcome of your  decisions on a daily or weekly basis in the initial stages. Suggest a  one-week trial and end with "I'd like to try it. Does that sound like  something we could try for a week?" or my personal favorite, "Is that  reasonable?" It's hard for people to label things unreasonable.  Realize that bosses are supervisors, not slave masters. Establish  yourself as a consistent challenger of the status quo and most people  will learn to avoid challenging you, particularly if it is in the interest  of higher per-hour productivity.  ======================================== [Página 119] ======================================== Interrupting Interruption and the Art of Refusal 107  If you are a micromanaging entrepreneur, realize that even if you  can do something better than the rest of the world, it doesn't mean  that's what you should be doing if it's part of the minutiae. Empower  others to act without interrupting you.  THE BOTTOM LINE is that you only have the rights you fight for.  Set the rules in your favor: Limit access to your time, force  people to define their requests before spending time with them, and  batch routine menial tasks to prevent postponement of more  important projects. Do not let people interrupt you. Find your focus  and you'll find your lifestyle.  In the next section, Automation, we'll see how the New Rich  create management-free money and eliminate the largest remaining  obstacle of all: themselves.  -Q&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS  People think it must be fun to be a super genius, but they  don't realize how hard it is to put up with all the idiots in  the world. —CALVIN, from Calvin and Hobbes  earn to recognize and fight the interruption impulse. This is  infinitely easier when you have a set of rules, responses, and  routines to follow. It is your job to prevent yourself and others from  letting the unnecessary and unimportant prevent the start-to-finish  completion of the important.  This chapter differs from the previous in that the necessary ac- tions, due to the inclusion of examples and templates, have been  presented throughout from start to finish. This Q & A will thus be a  summa ry rather than a repetition. The devil is in the details, so be  sure to reread this chapter for the specifics.  The 50,000-foot review is as follows: L  ======================================== [Página 120] ======================================== 108 STEP II: E IS FOR ELIMINATION  i.   Create systems to limit your availability via e-mail and phone and  deflect inappropriate contact.  Get the autoresponse and voicemai l script in place now, and mas- ter the various methods of evasion. Replace the habit of "How are  you?" with "How can I help you?" Get specific and remember—•  no stories. Focus on immediate actions and practice interruption- killing policies.  Avoid meet ings whenever possible.  ■-Use e-mail instead of face-to-face meet ings to solve  problems. •-Beg-off going (this can be accomplished through  the Puppy  Dog Close).  If meet ings are unavoidable, keep the following in mind:  -Go in with a clear set of objectives. - Set an end time or leave early.  2. Batch activities to limit setup cost and provide more time for  dreamline milestones.  What can I routinize by batching? That is, what tasks (whether  laundry, groceries, mail, payments, or sales reporting, for ex- ample) can I allot to a specific time each day, week, month, quar- ter, or year so that I don't squander time repeating them more  often than is absolutely necessary?  3. Set or request autonomous rules and guidelines with occa  sional review of results.  Eliminate the decision bottleneck for all things that are nonfatal if  misperformed. If an employee, believe in yourself enough to ask  for more independence on a trial basis. Have practica l "rules"  prepared and ask the boss for the sale after surprising him or her  with an impromptu presentation. Remem ber the Puppy Dog  Close—make it a one-time trial and reversible.  For the entrepreneur or manager, give others the chance to  ======================================== [Página 121] ======================================== Interrupting Interruption and the Art of Refusal 109  prove themselves. The likelihood of irreversible or expensive  problems is minimal and the time savings are guaranteed. Re- member, profit is only profitable to the extent that you can use it.  For that you need time.  -COMFORT CHALLENGE  Revisit the Terrible Twos (2 Days)  For the next two days, do as all good two-year-olds do and say "no"  to all requests. Don't be selective. Refuse to do all things that won't  get you imme diately fired. Be selfish. As with the last exercise, the  objective isn't an outcome—in this case, eliminating just those things  that waste time—bu t the process: getting comfortable with saying  "no." Potential questions to decline include the following:  Do you have a minute?  Want to see a movie tonight/tomorrow?  Can you help me with X?  "No" should be your default answer to all requests. Don't make  up elaborate lies or you'll get called on them. A simple answer such  as, "I really can't—sorry; I've got too much on my plate right now"  will do as a catch-all response.  ======================================== [Página 122] ======================================== 1  ======================================== [Página 123] ======================================== Step III: A is for  Automation   SCOTTY:  She's all yours, sir.

It will set the stage for even more incredible things to come, all of  which you will do yourself.  My Outsourced Life  A true account by AJ Jacobs, editor-at-large at Esquire magazine  (ellipses represent passage of time between entries)  IT BEGAN a month ago. I was midway through The World Is Flat, the  bestseller by Tom Friedman. I like Friedman, despite his puzzling decision to  wear a mustache. His book is all about how outsourcing to India and China  is not just for tech support and carmakers but is poised to transform every  industry in America, from law to banking to accounting.  I don't have a corporation; I don't even have an up-to-date business  card. I'm a writer and editor working from home, usually in my boxer shorts  or, if I'm feeling formal, my penguin-themed pajama bottoms.  12. To exploit global pricing and currency differences for profit or lifestyle purposes.  ======================================== [Página 126] ======================================== 114 STEP III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  Then again , I think, why should  Fortune 500 firms have all the fun? Why  can't I join in on the biggest business trend of the new century? Why can't I  outsource my low-end tasks? Why can't I outsource my life?  The next day I e-mail Brickwork, one of the companies Friedman  mentions in his book. Brickwork—based in Bangalore, India—offers "remote  executive assistants," mostly to financial firms and healthcare companies  that want data processed. I explain that I'd like to hire someone to help with  Fsquire-re\afed tasks—doing research, formatting memos, like that. The  company's CEO, Vivek Kulkarni, responds, "It would be a great pleasure to  be talking to a person of your stature." Already I'm liking this. I've never had  stature before. In America, I barely command respect from a Bennigan's  maTtre d', so it's nice to know that in India I have stature.  A couple of days later, I get an e-mail from my new "remote executive  assistant."  Dear Jacobs,  My name is Honey K. Balani. I would be assisting you in  your editorial and personal job. ... I would try to adapt  myself as per your requirements that would lead to desired  satisfaction.  Desired satisfaction. This is great. Back when I worked at an office, I had  assistants, but there was never any talk of desired satisfaction, In fact, if  anyone ever used the phrase "desired satisfaction," we'd all end up in a  solemn meeting with HR.  I GO OUT to dinne r with my friend Misha, who grew up in India, founded a  software firm, and subsequently became nauseatingly rich. I tell him about  Operation Outsource.

YMII is their overseas concierge service—it buys movie tickets and  cell phones and other sundries for abandoned moms.  Perfect. This could kick my outsourcing up to a new level. I can have a  nice, clean division of labor: Honey will take care of my business affairs, and  YMII can attend to my personal life—pay my bills, make vacation  reservations, buy stuff online. Happil y, YMII likes the idea, and just like that  the support team at Jacobs Inc. has doubled.  • • •  HONEY HAS completed her first project for me: research on the person  Esquirehas chosen as the Sexiest Woman Alive. I've been  assigned  to write  a profile of this woman, and I really don't want to have to slog through all the  heavy-breathing fan websites abou t her. When I open Honey's file, I have  this reaction: America is f*cked. There are charts. There are section  heade rs. There is a well-organized breakdown of her pets, measurements,  and favorite foods (e.g., swordfish). If all Bangalo-rians are like Honey, I pity  Americans about to gradua te college. They're up against a hung ry, polite,  Excel-proficient Indian army.  IN FACT, in the next few days, I outsource a whole mess of online errands  to Asha (from the personal service YMII): paying my bills, getting stuff from  drugstore.com, finding my son a Tickle Me Elmo. (Actually, the store was out  of Tickle Me Elmos, so Asha bought a Chicken Dance Elmo—good  decision.) I had her call Cingular to ask about my cell-phone plan. I'm just  guessing, but I bet her call was routed from Bangalore to New Jersey and  then back to a Cingular employee in Bangalore, which makes me happy for  some reason.  IT'S THE fourth morning of my new, farmed-out life, and when I flip on my  computer, my e-mail inbox is already filled with updates from my  ======================================== [Página 128] ======================================== 116 STEP III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  overseas aides. It's a strange feeling having people work for you while you  sleep. Strange, but great. I'm not wasting time while I drool on my pillow;  things are getting done.  HONEY IS my protector. Consider this: For some reason, the Colorado  Tourism Board e-mails me all the time. (Most recently, they informed me  abou t a festival in Colorado Springs featuring the world's most famous  harlequin.) I request that Honey gently ask them to stop with the press  releases. Here's what she sent:  Dear All,  Jacobs often receives mails from Colorado news, too often.  They are definitely interesting topics. However, these topics are  not suitable for "Esquire."  Further, we do understand that you have taken a lot of  initiatives working on these articles and sending it to us. We  unde rstand. Unfortunately, these articles and mails are too time  consuming to be read.  Currently, these mails are not serving right purpose for both  of us. Thus, we request to stop sending these mails.  We do not mean to demean your research work by this.  We hope  you unde rstand too.  Thanking you,  Honey K B  That is the best rejection notice in journalism history. It's exceedin gly  polite, but there's a little undercurrent of indignation. Honey seems almost  outraged that Colorado would waste the valuable time of Jacobs.  I decide to test the next logical relationship: my marriage. These arguments  with my wife are killing me—partly because Julie is a much better debater  than I am. Maybe Asha can do better:  ======================================== [Página 129] ======================================== Outsourcing Life 117  Hello Asha,  My wife got annoyed at me because I forgot to get cash at  the automatic bank machine ... I wonde r if you could tell her that  I love her, but gently remind her that she too forgets things—she  has lost her wallet twice in the last month. And she forgot to buy  nail clippers for Jasper.  A3  I can't tell you what a thrill I got from sending that note. It's pretty hard to  get much more passive-aggressive than bickering with your wife via an e- mail from a subcontinent halfway around the world.  The next morning, Asha CC'd me on the e-mail she sent to Julie.  Julie,  Do unde rstand your anger that I forgot to pick up the  cash at the automatic machine. I have been forgetful and I  am sorry about that.  But I guess that doesn't change the fact that I love you  so much. . . .  Love  AJ  P. S. This is Asha mailing on behal f of Mr. Jacobs.  As if that weren't enoug h, she also sent Julie an e-card. I click on it: two  teddy bears embracing, with the words, "Anytime you need  a hug,  I've got one for you. ... I'm sorry."  Damn! My outsourcers are too friggin' nice! They kept the apology part  but took out my little jabs. They are trying to save me from myself. They are  superegoing my id. I feel castrated.  Julie, on the other hand, seems quite pleased: "That's nice, sweetie. I  forgive you."  DESPITE THREE weeks with my support team, I'm still stressed. Perhaps  it's the fault of Chicken Dance Elmo, whom my son loves to the 31  ======================================== [Página 130] ======================================== 118 STEP III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  point of dry humping, but who is driving me slowly insane. Whatever the  reason, I figure it's time to conque r another frontier: outsourcing my inner  life.  First, I try to delegate my therapy. My plan is to give Asha a list of my  neuroses and a childhood anecdote or two, have her talk to my shrink for 50  minutes, then relay the advice. Smart, right? My shrink refused. Ethics or  something. Fine. Instead, I have Asha send me a meticulously researched  memo on stress relief. It had a nice Indian flavor to it, with a couple of yogic  postures and some visualization.  This was okay, but it didn't seem quite enough. I decided I needed to  outsource my worry. For the last few weeks I've been tearing my hair out  because a business deal is taking far too long to close. I asked Honey if she  would be interested in tearing her hair out in my stead. Just for a few  minutes a day. She thought it was a wonderful idea. "I will worry abou t this  every day," she wrote. "Do not worry."  The outsourcing of my neuroses was one of the most successful ex- periments of the month. Every time I started to ruminate, I'd remind myself  that Honey was already on the case, and I'd relax. No joke— this alone  was  worth it.  At a Glance: Where You Will Be  The future is here.

Interviews for this week had been set by a third  Indian virtual assistant, who had also found contact information for  the best Kendo schools in Japan and the top salsa teachers in Cuba.  In the next e-mail folder, I was pleased to see that my fulfillment ac- count manager in Tennessee, Beth, had resolved nearly two dozen  problems in the last week—keeping our largest clients in China and  South Africa smiling—and had also coordinated California sales tax  filing with my accountants in Michigan. The taxes had been paid via  my credit card on file, and a quick glance at my bank accounts  confirmed that Shane and the rest of the team  at my credit card  processor were depositing more cash than last month. All was right  in the world of automation.  It was a beautiful sunny day, and I closed my laptop with a smile.  For an all-you-can-eat buffet breakfast with coffee and orange juice,  I paid $4 U.S. The Indian outsourcers cost between $4-10 U.S. per  hour. My domestic outsourcers are paid on performance or when  product ships. This creates a curious business phenomenon: Negative  cash flow is impossible.  Fun things happen when you earn dollars, live on pesos, and  compensate in rupees, but that's just the beginning.  But I'm an Employee! How Does This Help Me?  Nobody can give you freedom.

It is small-scale training  wheels for the most critical of NR skills: remote management and  communication. G  ======================================== [Página 132] ======================================== 120 STEP III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  It is time to learn how to be the boss. It isn't time-consuming. It's  low-cost and it's low-risk. Whether or not you "need" someone at  this point is immate rial. It is an exercise.  It is also a litmus test for entrepreneurship: Can you manage (di- rect and chastise) other people? Given the proper instruction and  practice , I believe so. Most entrepreneurs fail because they jump into  the deep end of the pool without learning to swim first. Using a  virtual assistant (VA) as a simple exercise with no downside, the  basics of management are covered in a 2-4-week test costing be- tween $100-400. This is an investment, not an expense, and the ROI  is astounding. It will be repaid in a maximum of 10-14 days, after  which it is pure timesaving profit.  Becoming a member of the NR is not just about working smarter.  It's about building a system to replace yourself.  This is the first exercise.  Even if you have no intention of becoming an entrepreneur, this  is the ultimate  continuation of our 80/20 and elimination process:  Preparing someone to replace you (even if it never happens) will  produce an ultrarefined set of rules that will cut remaining fat and  redundancy from your schedule. Lingering unimportant tasks will  disappear as soon as someone else is being paid to do them.  But what about the cost?  This is a hurdle that is hard for most. If I can do it better than an  assistant, why should I pay them at all? Because the goal is to free your  time to focus on bigger and better things.  This chapter is a low-cost exercise to get you past this lifestyle  limiter. It is absolutely necessary that you realize that you can always  do something more cheaply yourself. This doesn't mean you want to  spend your time doing it. If you spend your time, worth $20-25 Per  hour, doing something that someone else will do for $10 per hour,  it's simply a poor use of resources. It is important to take baby steps  toward paying others to do work for you. Few do it, which is another  reason so few people have their ideal lifestyles.  ======================================== [Página 133] ======================================== Outsourcing Life 121  Even if the cost is occasionally more per hour than you currently  earn, the trade is often worth it. Let's assume you make $50,000  and  thus $25 per hour (working from 9-5, Monday through Friday, for 50  weeks per year). If you pay a top-notch assistant $30 per hour and he  or she saves you one full 8-hour shift per week, your cost  (subtracting what you're being paid) is $40 to free an extra day.  Would you pay $40 per week to work Monday to Thursday? I would,  and I do. Keep in mind that this is a worst-case cost scenario.  But what if your boss freaks out?  It's largely a non-issue, and prevention is better than cure. There  is no ethical or legal reason for the boss to know if you choose non- sensitive tasks. The first option is to assign personal items. Time is  time, and if you're spending time on chores and errands that could be  spent better elsewhere, a VA will improve life and the management  learning curve is similar. Second, you can delegate business tasks  that don't include financial information or identify your company.  Ready to build an army of assistants? Let's first look at the dark  side of delegation. A review is in order to prevent abuses of power  and wasteful behavior.  Delegation Dangers: Before Getting Started  The first rule of any technology used in a business is that  automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify  the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an  inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency.  —BILL GATES  ave you ever been given illogical assignments, handed unim- portant work, or comma nded to do something in the most in- efficient fashion possible? Not fun and not productive.  Now it's your turn to show that you know better. Delegation is to  be used as a further step in reduction, not as an excuse to create H  ======================================== [Página 134] ======================================== 122 STEP III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  more movement and add the unimportant. Remem ber—unless  something is well-defined and important, no one should do it.  Eliminate before you delegate.  Never automate  something that can be eliminated, and never  delegate something that can be automate d or streamlined. Otherwise,  you waste someone else's time instead of your own, which now  wastes your hard-earned cash. How's that for incentive to be  effective and efficient? Now you're playing with your own dough.  It's something I want you to get comfortable with, and this baby step  is small stakes.  Did I mention to eliminate before you delegate?  For example, it is popular among executives to have assistants  read e-mail. In some cases this is valuable. In my case, I use spam fil- ters, autoresponders with FAQs, and automatic forwarding to out- sourcers to limit my e-mail obligation to 10-20 e-mail responses per  week. It takes me 30 minutes per week because I used systems—  elimination and automation—to make it so.  Nor do I use an assistant to set meeti ngs and conference calls be- cause I have eliminated meeti ngs. If I need to set the odd 20-minute  call for a given month, I'll send one two-sentence e-mail and be done  with it.  Principle number one is to refine rules and processes before  adding people. Using people to leverage a refined process multiplies  production; using people as a solution to a poor process multiplies  problems.

It's  a good question, but I don't want to answer it. I want to watch  Family Guy.  The truth be told, it is a hell of a lot of work writing about not  working. Ritika of Brickwork and Venky of YMII are more than  capable of writing this section, so I'll just mention two guidelines and  leave the mental hernia of detail work to them.  Golden Rule #1: Each delegated task must be both time- consuming and well-defined. If you're running around like a  chicken with its head cut off and assign your VA to do that for  you, it doesn't improve the order of the universe.  Golden Rule #2:  On a lighter note, have some fun with it.  Have someone in Bangalore or Shanghai send e-mails to  friends as your personal concierge to set lunch dates or  similar basics. Harass your boss with odd phone calls in  strong accents from unkno wn numbers. Being effective  doesn't mean being serious all the time. It's fun being in  control for a change. Get a bit of repression off your chest  so it doesn't turn into a complex later.  Getting Personal and Going Howard Hughes   oward Hughes, the ultrarich filmmaker and eccentric from The Aviator, was  notorious for assigning odd tasks to his assistants. Here are a few you might want  to consider.13  1. After his first plane crash, Hughes confided in a friend that he believed his  recovery was due to his consumption of orange juice and its healing  properties. He believed that exposure to the air  13. Donald Bartlett, Howard Hughe s: His Life and Madne ss. T  H  ======================================== [Página 136] ======================================== 124 STEP III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  diluted the juice's potency, so he demanded that fresh oranges be sliced and  juiced in front of him.  2. When Hughes was partaking of the nightlife in Las Vegas, his aides were  charged with approaching any girls he took a liking to. If a girl was invited to  join the Hughes table and agreed, an aide would pull out a waiver and  agreement for her to sign.  3. Hughes had a barber on call 24/7 but had his hair and nails trimmed  about once a year.  4. In his hotel-bound years, Hughes was rumored to have instructed  assistants to place a single cheeseburger in a specific tree outside his  penthouse room at a 4:00 P.M. each day, whether he was there or not.  Such a world of possibilities! Just as the Model-T brought transportation to  the masses, virtual assistants bring eccentric billionaire behavior within reach of  each man, woman, and child. Now, that's progress.  ithout further ado, let me pass the mic. Note that YMII per- forms both personal and business tasks, whereas Brickwork  focuses solely on business projects. Let's start with the important but  dull stuff and move quickly from the sublime to the ridiculous. To  give a true taste of what to expect, I have not corrected non-native- sounding English.  Venky: Don't limit yourself. Just ask us if something is possible.  We've arranged parties, organized caterers, researched summer  courses, cleaned up accounting books, created 3D drafts based  on blueprints. Just ask us.

This frees up your time  to work or hang out with your son.  What can we not do? We can't do anything that would re- quire our physical presence.

Basic Choices: New Delhi or New York?  here are tens of thousands of VAs—ho w on earth do you find the  right one? The resources at the end of this chapter will show you  where to look, but it is overwhelming and confusing unless you have  a few criteria determined in advance.  It often helps to begin with the question "Where on Earth?" T  ======================================== [Página 139] ======================================== Outsourcing Life 127  Remote or Local?  "Made in the USA" doesn't have the ring it used to. The pros of jumping  time zones and visiting third-world currency are twofold: People work while  you sleep, and the per-hour expense is less. Time savings and cost savings.  Ritika explains the former with an example.  One can give the remote personal assistant in India their assignment  when they are leaving work at the end of the day in New York City, and  they will have the presentation ready the next morning. Because of the  time difference with India, assistants can work on it while they are  asleep and have it back in their morning. When they wake up, they will  find the completed summ ary in their inbox. These assistants can also  help them keep pace with what they want to read, for example.  Indian and Chinese VAs, as well as most from other developing  countries, will run $4-15 per hour, the lower end being limited to simple  tasks and the higher end including the equivalent of Harvard or Stanford  M.B.A.s and Ph.D.s. Need a business plan to raise funding? Brickwork can  provide it for between $2,500-5,000 instead of $15,000-20,000. Foreign  assistance isn't just for the small time. I know from firsthand discussions  that executives from big five accounting and management consulting firms  routinely charge clients six figures for research reports that are then farmed  to India for low four figures.  In the United States or Canada, the per-hour range is often $25-100.  Seems like an obvious choice, right? Bangalore 100%? It's not. The  important metric is cost per completed task, not cost per hour.  The biggest challenge with overseas help will be the language barrier,  which often quadruples back-and-forth discussion and the ultimate cost. The  first time I hired an Indian VA, I made the fundamental mistake of not  setting an hour cap for three simple tasks. I checked in later that week and  found he had spent 23 hours chasing his tail. He had scheduled one tentative  interview for the following week, set at the wrong time! Mind boggling. 23  hours? It ended up  ======================================== [Página 140] ======================================== 128 STEP III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  costing me, at $10 per hour, $230. The same tasks, assigned later that  week to a native English speaker in Canada, were completed in two  hours at $25 per hour. $50 for more than four times the results. That  said, I later requested another Indian VA from the same firm who  was able to duplicate the native speaker results.  How do you know which to choose? That's the beautiful part:  You don't. It's a matte r of testing a few assistants to both sharpen  your communication skills and determine who is worth hiring and  who is worth firing. Being a results-based boss isn't as simple as it  looks.  There are a number of lessons to be learned here.  First, per-hour cost is not the ultimate  determinant of cost. Look  at per-task cost. If you need to spend time restating the task and  otherwise managing the VA, determine the time required of you and  add this (using your per-hour rate from earlier chapters) to the end  sticker price of the task. It can be surprising. As cool as it is to say  that you have people working for you in three countries, it's uncool  to spend time babysitting people who are supposed to make your life  easier.  Second, the proof is in the pudd ing. It is impossible to predict  how well you will work with a given VA without a trial. Luckily,  there are things you can do to improve your odds, and one of them is  using a VA firm instead of a solo operator.  Solo vs. Suppo rt Team  Let's suppose you find the perfect VA. He or she is performing all of  your noncritical  tasks and you've decided to take a much-deserved  vacation to Thailand. It's nice to know someone besides you will be  manning the wheel and putting out fires for a change. Finally, some  relief! Two hours before your flight from Bangkok to Phuket, you  receive an e-mail: Your VA is out of commission and will be in the  hospital for the next week. Not good. Vacation FUBAR.  ======================================== [Página 141] ======================================== Outsourcing Life 129  I don't like being dependent on one person, and I don't recom- mend it in the least. In the world of high technology, this type of  dependency would be referred to as a "single point of failure"—one  fragile item upon which all else depends. In the world of IT,14 the  term "redundancy" is used as a selling point for systems that continue  to function if there is a malfunction or mechanical failure in any  given part. In the context of VAs, redundancy entails having fallback  support.  I recomme nd that you hire a VA firm or VAs with backup team s  instead of sole operators. Examples abound, of course, of people who  have had a single assistant for decades without incident, but I suggest  that this is the exception rather than the rule. Better safe than sorry.  Besides simple disaster avoidance, a group structure provides a pool  of talent that allows you to assign multiple tasks without bothering to  find a new person with the qualifications. Brickwork and YMII both  exemplify this type of structure and provide a single point of contact,  a personal account manager, who then farms out your tasks to the  most-capable people in the group and across different shifts. Need  graphic design? Covered. Need database management? Covered. I  don't like calling and coordinating multiple people. I want one-stop  shopping and am willing to pay 10% more to have it. I encourage you  to be similarly pound-wise and penny-foolish.  Team  preference doesn't mean that bigger is better, just that  multiple people are better than one person. The best VA I have used  to date is an Indian with five backup assistants under him. Three can  be more than sufficient, but two is toeing the line.  14. Information technology.  ======================================== [Página 142] ======================================== 1  130 STEP III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  The #1 Fear: "Sweetheart, Did You Buy a  Porsche in China?"  T 'm sure you might have your fears. A} certainly did:  My outsourcers now know an alarming amount about me—not just my  schedule but my cholesterol, my infertility problems, my Social Security  number, my passwords (including the one that is a particularly  adolescent curse word). Sometimes I worry that I can't piss off my  outsourcers or I'll end up with a $12,000 charge on my MasterCard bill  from the Louis Vuitton in Anantapur.  The good  news is that misuse of financial and confidential information is  rare. In all of the interviews I condu cted for this section, I could find only  one case of information abuse, and I had to search long and hard. It  involved an overworked U.S.-based VA who hired freelance help at the last  moment.  Commit to memory the following—never use the new hire. Prohibit  small-operation VAs from subcontracting work to untested freelancers  without your written permission. The more established and higher-end  firms, Brickwork in the below example, have security measures that border  on excessive and make it simple to pinpoint abusers in the case of a breach:  "-Employees undergo background checks and sign NDAs  (nond isclosure agreements) in accordance with the company policy of  maintaining confidentiality of client information ■-Electronic access  card for entry and exit "Credit card information keyed only by select  supervisors "Removal of paper from the offices is prohibited "VLAN- based access restrictions between different teams; this ensures that there  is no unauthorized access of information between people of different  teams in the organization  ======================================== [Página 143] ======================================== Outsourcing Life 131  •-Regular reporting on printer logs  ^Floppy drives and USB ports disabled  "BS779 certification for accomplished international security  standards "128-bit encryption technology for all data  exchange "Secure VPN  connection  I bet there is a fair chance that sensitive data is 100 times safer  with Brickwork than on your own computer.  Still, information theft is best thought of as inevitable in a digital  world, and precautions should be taken with damage control in mind.  There are two rules that I use to minimize damage and allow for fast  repair.  1. Never use debit cards for online transactions or with remote  assistants. Reversing unauthorized credit card charges, particu- larly with American Express, is painless and near instantaneous.  Recovering funds withdrawn from your checking account via  unauthorized debit card use takes dozens of hours in paperwork  alone and can take months to receive, if approved at all.  2. If your VA will be accessing websites on your behalf, create a  new unique login and password to be used on those sites. Most of  us reuse both logins and passwords on multiple sites, and taking  this precaution limits possible damage. Instruct them to use these  unique logins to create accounts on new sites if needed. Note that  this is particularly important when using assistants who have  access to live comme rcial websites (developers, programme rs,  etc.).  If information or identity theft hasn't hit you, it will. Use these  guidelines and you'll realize when it happens that, just like most  nightmares, it's not that big a deal and is reversible.  ======================================== [Página 144] ======================================== 132 STEP III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  The Complicated Art of Simplicity:  Commo n Complaints  y assistant is an idiot!

It is tempting to M  ======================================== [Página 145] ======================================== Outsourcing Life 133  imme diately point the finger at someone else and huff and puff, but  most beginner bosses repeat the same mistakes I made.  1. I accepted the first person the firm provided and made no  special requests at the outset.  Request someone who has "excellent" English and indicate that  phone calls will be required (even if not). Be fast to request a  replaceme nt if there are repeated communication issues.  2. I gave imprecise directions.  I asked him to schedule interviews but didn't indicate that it was  for an article. He assumed, based on work with previous clients,  that I wanted to hire someone and he misspent time compiling  spreadsheets and combing online job sites for additional infor- mation I didn't need.  Sentences should have one possible interpretation and be  suitable for a 2nd-grade reading level. This goes for native speak- ers as well and will make requests clearer. Ten-dollar words dis- guise imprecision.  Note that I asked him to respond if he didn't understand or had  questions. This is the wrong approach. Ask foreign VAs to  rephrase tasks to confirm understanding before getting started.  3. I gave him a license to waste time.  This brings us again to damage control. Request a status update  after a few hours of work on a task to ensure that the task is both  understood and achievable. Some tasks are, after initial attem pts,  impossible.  4. I set the deadline a week in advance.  Use Parkinson's Law and assign tasks that are to be completed  within no more than 72 hours. I have had the best luck with 48  and 24 hours. This is another compelling reason to use a small  group (three or more) rather than a single individual who can be- come overtaxed with last-minute requests from multiple clients.  ======================================== [Página 146] ======================================== 134 STEP III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  Using short deadlines does not mean avoiding larger tasks (e.g.,  business plan), but rather breaking them into smaller milestones  that can be completed in shorter time frames (outline, competitive  research summa ries, chapters, etc.).  5. I gave him too many tasks  and didn't set an order of  importance.  I advise sending one task at a time whenever possible and no  more than two. If you want to cause your computer to hang or  crash, open 20 windows and applications at the same time. If you  want to do the same to your assistant, assign him or her a dozen  tasks without prioritizing them. Recall our mantra: Eliminate  before you delegate.

I would like to start with the following task.  TASK: I need  to find the names and e-mails of editors of  men's magazines in the US (for example: maxim, stuff, GQ,  esquire, blender, etc.) who also have written books. An example  of such a person would be AJ Jacobs who is Editor-at-Large of  Esquire (www.ajjacobs.com). I already have his information and  need  more like him.  Can you do this?

The extent to  which you will outsource next makes delegation look like finger  painting.  In the world of automation, not all business models are created  equal. How do you assemble a business and coordinate all its parts  without lifting a finger? How do you automate  cash deposits in your  bank account while avoiding the most common problems? It begins  with understanding the options, the art of dodging information flow,  and what we will call "muses."  The next chapter is a blueprint for the first step: a product.  -Q&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS  i.   Get an assistant—even if you don't need one.

Tina Forsyth, an online business manager (higher-level VA) who  helps six-figure-income clients achieve seven figures with busi- ness model redesigns, makes the following recomme ndations:  •-Look at your to-do list—what has been sitting on it the  longest?  •-Each time you are interrupted or change tasks, ask,  "Could a VA do this?"  ■-Examine pain points—what causes you the most frustration  and boredom?

Let go of the controls a bit. Don't assign crap tasks  that end up consuming rather than saving time. It makes little  sense to spend 10 to 15 minutes sending an e-mail to India to get a  price quote on a plane ticket when you could do the same online  in 10 minutes and avoid all the subsequent back-and-forth.  Push outside your comfort zone—that is the entire point of the  exercise. It is always possible to reclaim a task for yourself if the  VA proves incapable, so test the limits of their capabilities.  3.   Identify your top five time-consuming nonwork tasks and five  personal tasks you could assign for sheer fun.  -COMFORT CHALLENGE  Use the Criticism Sandwich (2 Days and Weekly)  Chances are good that someone—be it co-worker, boss, customer, or  significant other—does something irritating or at a subpar level.  Rather than avoid the topic out of fear of confrontation, let's  chocolate-coat it and ask them to fix it. Once per day for two days,  and then each Thursday (Monday through Wednesday is too tense  and Friday is too relaxed) for the next three weeks, resolve to use  what I call the "Criticism Sandwich" with someone. Put it on the cal- endar. It's called the Criticism Sandwich because you first praise the  person for something, then deliver the criticism, and then close with  topic-shifting praise to exit the sensitive topic. Here's an example  with a superior or boss, with keywords and phrases underlined.  ======================================== [Página 150] ======================================== 138 STEP  III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  You: Hi, Mara. Do you have a second?   Mara: Sure. What's up?  You: First, I wanted to thank you for helping me with the Meelie  Worm account [or whatever]. J really appreciate you showing  me how to handle that. You're really good  at fixing the technical  issues.  Mara: No problem.   You: Here's the thing.15 There is a lot of work coming down on  everyone, and I'm feeling16 a bit overwhelmed. Normally, priori- ties are really clear to me,17 but I've been having trouble recently  figuring out which tasks are highest on the list. Could you help  me by pointing out the most important items when a number  need to be done? I'm sure it's just me,18 but I'd really appreciate  it, and I think it would help.  Mara: Uhh... I'll see what I can do.  You: That means a lot to me. Thanks. Before I forget,19 last week's  presentation was excellent.  Mara: Did you think so? Blah, blah, blah ...  15. Don't call it a problem if you can avoid it.  16. No one can argue with your feelings, so use this to avoid a debate about external  circumstances.  17. Notice how I take "you" out of the sentence to avoid finger-pointing, even though  it's implicit. "Normally, you make priorities clear" sounds like a backhanded insult. If  this is significant other, you can skip this formality, but never use "you always do X,"  which is just a fight starter.  18. Take a little bit of the heat off with this. The point has already been made.  19. "Before I forget" is a great segue to the closing compliment, which is also a topic  shifter and gets you off the sensitive topic without awkwardness.  ======================================== [Página 151] ======================================== o   Income Autopilot I  -FINDING THE MUSE  Just set it and forget it!  —RON POPEIL, founder of RONCO; responsible for more  than $i billion in sales of rotisserie chicken roasters  As to methods there may be a million and then some, but  principles are few.

First things first: coffee. The jet lag was  minor, considering he had just returned from a two-week jaunt through the  islands of Croatia. It was just one of six countries he had visited in the last  12 months. Japan was next on the agenda.  Buzzing with a smile and his coffee mug in hand, he ambled over to his  Mac to check on personal e-mail first. There were 32 messages and all  brough t good  news.  One of his friends and business partners, also a cofound er of Limewire,  had an update: Last Bamboo, their start-up poised to reinvent peer-to-peer  technology, was round ing the final corners of D ======================================== [Página 152] ======================================== 140 STEP III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  development. It could be their billion-dollar baby, but Doug was let- ting the engineers run wild first.  Samson Projects, one of the hottest contemporary art galleries in  Boston, had compliments for Doug's latest work and requests for  expanded involvement with new exhibits as their sound curator.  The last e-mail in his inbox was a fan letter addressed to "Demon  Doc" and praise for his latest instrumental hip-hop album, onliness  VI.O.I. Doug had released his album as what he termed "open source  music"—anyone could download the album for free and use sounds  from any track in his or her own compositions.  He smiled again, polished off his dark roast, and opened a win- dow to deal with business e-mail next. It would take much less time.  In fact, less than 30 minutes for the day and 2 hours for the week.  How much things change.  Two years earlier, in June of 2004,  I was in Doug's apartment  checking e-mail for what I hoped would be the last time for a long  time. I was headed to JFK Airport in New York in a matte r of hours  and was preparing for an indefinite quest around the world. Doug  looked on with amusement. He had similar plans for himself and was  finally extricating himself from a venture-funded Internet startup that  had once been a cover story and his passion but was now just a job.  The euphoria of the dot-com era was long dead, along with most  chances for a sale or an IPO.  He bid me farewell and made a decision as the taxi pulled from  the curb—enough of the complicated stuff. It was time to return to  basics.  Prosoundeffects.com, launched in January of 2005  after one week  of sales testing on eBay, was designed to do one thing: give Doug  lots of cash with minimal time investment.  This brings us back to his business inbox in 2006.   There are 10 orders for sound libraries, CDs that film producers,  musicians, video game designers, and other audio professionals use  to add hard-to-find sounds—whether the purr of a lemur or an  ======================================== [Página 153] ======================================== Income Autopilot I 141  exotic instrument—to their own creations. These are Doug's prod- ucts, but he doesn't own them, as that would require physical inven- tory and upfront cash. His business model is more elegant than that.  Here is just one revenue stream:   1. A prospective customer sees his Pay-Per-Click (PPC) adver- tising on Google or other search engines and clicks through to his  site, www .prosoundeffects.com.  2. The prospect orders a product for $325 (the average purchase  price, though prices range from $29-7,500)  on a Yahoo shopping  cart, and a PDF with all their billing and shipping information is  automatically e-mailed to Doug.  3. Three times a week, Doug presses a single button in the  Yahoo management page to charge all his customers' credit cards  and put cash in his bank account. Then he saves the PDFs  as  Excel purchase orders and e-mails the purchase orders to the  manufacturers of the CD libraries. Those companies mail the  products to Doug's customers—this is called drop-shipping— and  Doug pays the manufacturers as little as 45% of the retail price of  the products up to 90 days later (net-90 terms).  Let's look at the mathematica l beauty of his system for full effect.  For each $325  order at his cost of 55% off retail, Doug is entitled  to $178.75.  If we subtract 1% of the full retail price (1% of $325  =  $3.25)  for the Yahoo Store transaction fee and 2.5% for the credit  card processing fee (2.5% of $325 = $8.13), Doug is left with a pre- tax profit of $167.3 8 for this one sale.  Multiply this by 10 and we have $1673.80  in profit for 30 min- utes of work. Doug is making $3,347.60 per hour and purchases no  product in advance. His initial start-up costs were $1,200  for the  webpage design, which he recouped in the first week. His PPC  advertising costs approximate ly $700 per month and he pays Yahoo  $99 per month for their hosting and shopping cart.  ======================================== [Página 154] ======================================== 142 STEP III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  He works less than two hours a week, often pulls more than  $10,000  per month, and there is no financial risk whatsoever.  Now Doug spends his time making music, traveling, and explor- ing new businesses for exciteme nt. Prosoundeffects.com is not his  end-all-be-all, but it has removed all financial concerns and freed his  mind to focus on other things.  What would you do if you didn't have to think about money? If  you follow the advice in this chapter, you will soon have to answer  this question.  It's time to find your muse.  THERE ARE A million and one ways to make a million dollars. From  franchising to freelance consulting, the list is endless. Fortunately,  most of them are unsuited to our purpose. This chapter is not for  people who want to run businesses but for those who want to own  businesses and spend no time on them.  The response I get when I introduce this concept is more or less  universal: Huh?  People can't believe that most of the ultrasuccessful companies in  the world do not manufacture their own products, answer their own  phones, ship their own products, or service their own customers.  There are hundreds of companies that exist to pretend to work for  someone else and handle these functions, providing rentable  infrastructure to anyone who knows where to find them.  Think Microsoft manufactures the Xbox 360 or that Kodak de- signs and distributes their digital came ras? Guess again. Flextronics,  a Singapore-based engineering and manufacturing firm with locations  in 30 countries and $15.3 billion in annual revenue, does both. Most  popular brands of mountain bikes in the United States are all  manufactured in the same three or four plants in China. Dozens of  call centers press one button to answer calls for the JC Penneys of the  world, another to answer calls for the Dell Computers of the world,  and yet another to answer calls for the New Rich like me.  ======================================== [Página 155] ======================================== Income Autopilot I 143  It's all beautifully transparent and cheap.  Before we create this virtual architecture, however, we need a  product to sell. If you own a service business, this section will help  you convert expertise into a shippable hard good to escape the limits  of a per-hour-based model. If starting from scratch, ignore service  businesses for now, as constant customer contact makes absence  difficult.20  To narrow the field further, our target product can't take more  than $500  to test, it has to lend itself to automation within four  weeks, and—when up and running—it can't require more than one  day per week of management.  Can a business be used to change the world, like The Body Shop  or Patagonia? Yes, but that isn't our goal here.  Can a business be used to cash out through an IPO or sale? Yes,  but that isn't our goal either.  Our goal is simple: to create an automate d vehicle for generating  cash without consuming time. That's it.21 I will call this vehicle a  "muse" whenever possible to separate it from the ambiguous term  "business," which can refer to a lemonade stand or a Fortune 10 oil  conglomerate—our objective is more limited and thus requires a  more precise label.  So first things first: cash flow and time. With these two curren- cies, all other things are possible. Without them, nothing is possible.  20. There are a few limited exceptions, such as online membership sites that  don't require content generation, but as a general rule, products require much  less maintenance and will get you to your TMI faster.  21. Muses will provide the time and financial freedom to realize your dreamlines  in record time, after which one can (and often does) start additional companies  to change the world or sell.  ======================================== [Página 156] ======================================== 144 STEP III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  Why to Begin with the End in Mind: A  Cautionary Tale  arah is excited. It has been two weeks since her line of humorous  T-shirts for golfers went online, and she is averaging 5 T-shirt  sales per day at $15 each. Her cost per unit is $5, so she is grossing  $50 in profit (minus 3% in credit card fees) per 24 hours, as she  passes shipping and handling on to customers. She should soon  recoup the cost of her initial order of 300 shirts (including plate  charges, setup, etc.)— but wants to earn more.  It's a nice reversal of fortune, considering the fate of her first  product. She had spent $12,000 to develop, patent, and manufacture  a high-tech stroller for new moms (she has never been a new mom),  only to find that no one was interested.  The T-shirts, in contrast, were actually selling, but sales were be- ginning to slow.  It appears she has reached her online sales ceiling, as well-funded  and uneducated competitors are now spending too much for adver- tising and driving up costs. Then it strikes her—retail!  Sarah approaches the manager of her local golf shop, Bill, who  imme diately expresses interest in carrying the shirts. She's thrilled.  Bill asks for the customary 40% minimum discount for wholesale  pricing. This means her sell price is now $9 instead of $15 and her  profit has dropped from $10 to $4. Sarah decides to give it a shot and  does the same with three other stores in surrounding towns. The  shirts begin to move off the shelves, but she soon realizes that her  small profit is being eaten by extra hours she spends handling  invoices and additional administration.  She decides to approach a distributor22 to alleviate this labor, a  company that acts as a shipping warehouse and sells products from  22. Distributors are also known as "wholesalers." S  ======================================== [Página 157] ======================================== Income Autopilot I 145  various manufacturers to golf stores nationwide. The distributor is in- terested and asks for its usual pricing—70% off of retail or $4.50—  which would leave Sarah 50 cents in the hole on each unit. She declines.  To make matte rs worse, the four local stores have already started  discounting her shirts to compete among one another and are killing  their own profit margins. Two weeks later, reorders disappear. Sarah  abandons retail and returns to her website demoralized. Sales online  have dropped to almost nothing with new competition. She has not  recouped her initial investment, and she still has 50 shirts in her  garage.  Not good.  It all could have been prevented with proper testing and planning.  ED "MR. CREATINE" BYRD is no Sarah. He does not invest and hope  for the best.  His San Francisco-based company, MRI, had the top-selling  sports supplement in the United States from 2002 -2005,  NO2. It is  still a top-seller despite dozens of imitators. He did it through smart  testing, smart positioning, and brilliant distribution.  Prior to manufacturing, MRI first offered a low-priced book re- lated to the product through Vi-page advertisements in men's health  magazines. Once the need had been confirmed with a mountain of  book orders, NO2 was priced at an outrageous $79.95, positioned as  the premium product on the market, and sold exclusively through  GNC stores nationwide. No one else was permitted to sell it.  How can it make sense to turn away business? There are a few  good reasons.  First, the more competing resellers there are, the faster your  product goes extinct. This was one of Sarah's mistakes.  It works like this: Reseller A sells the product for your recom- mended advertised price of $50, then reseller B sells it for $45 to  compete with A, and then C sells it for $40 to compete with A and B.  In no time at all, no one is making profit from selling your product  ======================================== [Página 158] ======================================== 146 STEP  III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  and reorders disappear. Customers are now accustomed to the lower  pricing and the process is irreversible. The product is dead and you  need to create a new product. This is precisely the reason why so  many companies need to create new product after new product  month after month. It's a headache.  I have had one single supplement, BrainQUICKEN® (also sold  as BodyQUICK®) for six years and have maintained a consistent  profit margin by limiting wholesale distribution, particularly online,  to the top one or two largest resellers who can move serious  quantities of product and agree to maintain a minimum advertised  pricing.23 Otherwise, rogue discounters on eBay and mom-and-pop  independents will drive you broke.  Second, if you offer someone exclusivity, which most manufac- turers try to avoid, it can work in your favor. Since you are offering  one company 100% of the distribution, it is possible to negotiate  better profit margins (offering less of a discount off of retail price),  better marketing support in-store, faster payment, and other prefer- ential treatme nt.  It is critical that you decide how you will sell and distribute your  product before you commit to a product in the first place. The more  middlemen are involved, the higher your margins must be to main- tain profitability for all the links in the chain.  Ed Byrd realized this and exemplifies how doing the opposite of  what most do can reduce risk and increase profit. Choo sing distri- bution before product is just one example.  Ed drives a Lamborghini down the California coast when not  traveling or in the office with his small focused staff and his two  Australian shepherds. This outcome is not accidental.

This is done by including a Minimum Advertised  Pricing (MAP) policy in your General Terms and Conditions (GTC), which are agreed  to automatically when a written wholesale order is placed. Sample GTC and order  forms are available at www .fourhourworkweek.com.  ======================================== [Página 159] ======================================== Income Autopilot I 147  creation methods—and those of the New Rich in general—can be emulated.  Here's how you do it in the fewest number of steps.  Step One: Pick an Affordably Reachable  Niche Market  When I was younger ... I [didn't] want to be pigeonho led ...  Basically, now you want to be pigeonho led. It's your niche. — JOAN CHEN, actress; appeared in The Last Emperor and Twin  Peaks  reating demand is hard. Filling demand is much easier. Don't create a  product, then seek someone to sell it to. Find a market— define your  customers—then find or develop a product for them.  I have been a student and an athlete, so I developed products for those  markets, focusing on the male demographic whenever possible. The  audiobook I created for college guidance counselors failed because I have  never been a guidance counselor. I developed the subsequent speed-reading  seminar after realizing that I had free access to students, and the business  succeeded because—being a student myself—I understood their needs and  spending habits. Be a member of your target market and don't speculate  what others need or will be willing to buy.  Start Small, Think Big  Some people are just into lavish dwarf entertainment. — DANNY BLACK (4'2"), part-owner ofShortdwarf.com24  Danny Black rents dwarfs as entertainment for $149  per hour. How is that  for a niche market?  24. The Wall Street Journal, July 18, 2005  (http://www .technologyinvestor.com/  Iogin/2004/Jul18-O5.php). C  ======================================== [Página 160] ======================================== 148 STEP III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  It is said that if everyone is your customer, then no one is your  customer. If you start off aiming to sell a product to dog- or car- lovers, stop. It's expensive to advertise to such a broad market, and  you are competing with too many products and too much free infor- mation. If you focus on how to train German shepherds or a  restoration product for antique Fords, on the other hand, the market  and competition shrink, making it less expensive to reach your  customers and easier to charge premium pricing.  BrainQUICKEN was initially designed for students, but the  market proved too scattered and difficult to reach. Based on positive  feedback from student-athletes, I relaunched the product as  BodyQUICK and tested advertising in magazines specific to martial  artists and powerlifters. These are minuscule markets compared to  the massive student market, but not small. Low media cost and lack  of competition enabled me to dominate with the first "neural  accelerator"25 in these niches. It is more profitable to be a big fish in  a small pond than a small undefined fish in a big pond. How do you  know if it's big enough to meet  your TMI? For a detailed real-life  example of how I determined the market size of a recent product, see  "Muse Math" on this book's companion site.  Ask yourself the following questions to find profitable niches.  1. Which social, industry, and professional groups do you  belong to, have you belonged  to, or do you unde rstand,  whether dentists, engineers, rock climbers, recreational  cyclists, car restoration aficionado s, dancers, or other?  Look creatively at your resume, work experience, physical habits,  and hobbies and compile a list of all the groups, past and present,  that you can associate yourself with. Look at products and books   25. This was a new product category that I created and coined to eliminate and  preempt the competition. Strive to be the largest, best, or first in a precise category. I  prefer being first.  ======================================== [Página 161] ======================================== Income Autopilot 1 149  you own, include online and offline subscriptions, and ask your- self, "What groups of people purchase the same?" Which maga- zines, websites, and newsletters do you read on a regular basis?  2. Which of the groups you identified have their own magazines?  Visit a large bookstore such as Barnes & Noble and browse the  magazine rack for smaller specialty magazines to brainstorm  additional niches. There are literally thousands of occupation- and  interest/hobby-specific magazines to choose from. Use Writer's  Market to identify magazine options outside the bookstores.  Narrow the groups from question 1 above to those that are reach- able through one or two small magazines. It's not important that  these groups all have a lot of money (e.g., golfers)—only that  they spend money (amate ur athletes, bass fishermen, etc.) on  products of some type. Call these magazines, speak to the ad- vertising directors, and tell them that you are considering adver- tising; ask them to e-mail their current advertising rate card and  include both readership numbers and magazine back-issue  samples. Search the back issues for repeat advertisers who sell  direct-to-consumer via 800 numbers or websites—the more repeat  advertisers, and the more frequent their ads, the more profitable a  magazine is for them... and will be for us.  Step Two: Brainstorm (Do Not Invest In) Products  Genius is only a superior power of seeing.  —JOHN  RUSKIN, famed art and social critic  ick the two markets that you are most familiar with that have their  own magazines with full-page advertising that costs less than  $5,000.  There should be no fewer than 15,000 readers.  This is the fun part. Now we get to brainstorm or find products  with these two markets in mind. P  ======================================== [Página 162] ======================================== 150 STEP III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  The goal is come up with well-formed product ideas and spend  nothing; in Step 3, we will create advertising for them and test re- sponses from real customers before investing in manufacturing.  There are several criteria that ensure the end product will fit into an  automate d architecture.  The Main Benefit Should Be Encapsulated in One Sentence.  People can dislike you—and you often sell more by offending some—  but they should never misunderstand you.  The main benefit of your product should be explainable in one  sentence or phrase. How is it different and why should I buy it? ONE  sentence or phrase, folks. Apple did an excellent job of this with the  iPod. Instead of using the usual industry jargon with GB, bandwidth,  and so forth, they simply said, "1,000  songs in your pocket." Done  deal. Keep it simple and do not move ahead with a product until you  can do this without confusing people.  It Should Cost the Customer $50-200.   The bulk of companies set prices in the midrange, and that is where  the most competition is. Pricing low is shortsighted, because some- one else is always willing to sacrifice more profit margin and drive  you both bankrupt. Besides perceived value, there are three main  benefits to creating a premium, high-end image and charging more  than the competition.  1. Higher pricing means that we can sell fewer units—and thus  manage fewer customers—and fulfill our dreamlines. It's  faster.  2. Higher pricing attracts lower-maintenance customers (better  credit, fewer complaints/questions, fewer returns, etc.). It's  less headache. This is HUG E.  3. Higher pricing also creates higher profit margins. It's safer.  ======================================== [Página 163] ======================================== Income Autopilot I 151  I personally aim for an 8-iox markup, which means a $100  product can't cost me more than $io-i2.50.26 If I had used the com- monly recomme nded 5 x markup with BrainQUICKEN, it would  have gone bankrupt within 6 months due to a dishonest supplier and  late magazine. The profit margin saved it, and within 12 months it  was generating up to $80,000 per month.  High has its limits, however. If the per-unit price is above a cer- tain point, prospects need to speak to someone on the phone before  they are comfortable enough to make the purchase. This is con- traindicated on our low-information diet.  I have found that a price range of $50-200 per sale provides the  most profit for the least customer service hassle. Price high and then  justify.  It Should Take No More Than 3 to 4 Weeks to Manufacture. This is  critically important for keeping costs low and adapting to sales  demand without stockpiling product in advance. I will not pursue any  product that takes more than three to four weeks to manufacture, and  I recomme nd aiming for one to two weeks from order placeme nt to  shippable product.  How do you know how long something takes to manufacture?  Contact contract manufacturers who specialize in the type of  products you're considering: http://www .thomasnet.com/. Call a  related manufacturer (e.g., toilet bowls) if you need a referral to a  related manufacturer you cannot find (e.g., toilet cleaning solutions).  Still no luck? Google different synonyms for your product in com- bination with "organization" and "association" to contact the appro- priate industry organizations. Ask them for referrals to contract  manufacturers and for the names of their trade magazines, which  26. If you decide to resell someone else's higher-end products like Doug, especially  with drop-shipping, the risk is lower and smaller margins can suffice.  ======================================== [Página 164] ======================================== 152 STEP  III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  often contain advertisements for contract manufacturers and related  service providers we'll need for your virtual architecture later.  Request pricing from the contract manufacturers to ensure the proper  markup is possible. Determine the per-unit costs of production for  ioo, 500,1,000, and 5,000 units.  It Should Be Fully Explainabl e in a Good Online FAQ.  Here is where I really screwed up in my product choice with Brain-  QUICKEN.  Even though ingestibles have enabled my NR life, I would not  wish them on anyone. Why not? You get 1,000  questions from every  customer: Can I eat bananas with your product? Will it make me fart  during dinner? On and on, ad nauseam. Choose a product that you  can fully explain in a good online FAQ. If not, the task of travelling  and otherwise forgetting about work becomes very difficult or you  end up spending a fortune on call center operators.  Understanding these criteria, a question remains: "How does one  obtain a good muse product that satisfies them?" There are three  options we'll cover in ascending order of recomme ndation.  Option One: Resell a Product  urchasing an existing product at wholesale and reselling it is the  easiest route but also the least profitable. It is the fastest to set up  but the fastest to die off due to price competition with other resellers.  The profitable life span of each product is short unless an exclusivity  agreeme nt prevents others from selling it. Reselling is, however, an  excellent option for secondary back-end27 products that  27. "Back-end" products are products sold to customers once the sale of a primary  product has been made. iPod covers and car GPS systems are two examples. These  products can have lower margins, because there is no advertising cost to acquire the  customer. P  ======================================== [Página 165] ======================================== Income Autopilot I 153  can be sold to existing customers or cross-sold28 to new customers  online or on the phone.  To purchase at wholesale, use these steps.  i.   Contact the manufacturer and request a "wholesale pricelist"  (generally 40% off retail) and terms. 2.  If a business tax ID  number is needed, print out the proper  forms from your state's Secretary of State website and file  for an LLC (which I prefer) or similar protective business  structure for $100 -200.  Do NOT purchase product until you have completed Step 3 in the  next chapter. It is enough at this point to confirm the profit margin  and have product photos and sales literature.  That's reselling. Not much more to it.  Option Two: License a Product  I not only use all the brains that I have, but all that I can  borrow. —WOOD ROW WILSON  ome of the world's best-known brands and products have been  borrowed from someone or somewhere else. The basis for the  energy drink Red Bull came  from a tonic in Thailand, and the Smurfs  were brought from Belgium. Pokemon came from the land of Honda.  The band KISS made millions in record and concert sales, but the  real profit has been in licensing— granting others the right to  produce hundreds of products with their name and image in  exchange for a percentage of sales.  There are two parties involved in a licensing deal, and a member  28. "Cross-selling" is selling a related product to a customer while they're still on the  phone or in an online shopping cart after the sale of a primary product has been  made.

S ======================================== [Página 166] ======================================== 154 STEP III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  of the New Rich could be either. First, there is the inventor of the  product,29 called the "licensor," who can sell others the right to manu- facture, use, or sell his or her product, usually for 3-10% of the whole- sale price (usually around 40% off retail) for each unit sold. Invent,  let someone else do the rest, and cash checks. Not a bad model.  The other side of the equation is the person interested in manu- facturing and selling the inventor's product for 90-gj% of the profit:  the licensee. This is, for me and most NR, more interesting.  Licensing is, however, dealmaking-intensive on both sides and a  science unto itself. Creative contract negotiation is essential and most  readers will run into problems if it's their first product. For real-world  case studies on both sides, ranging from Teddy Ruxp in to Tae-Bo,  and full agreeme nts with actual dollar amounts, visit  www .fourhourworkweek.com. From how to sell inventions without  prototypes or patents to how to secure rights to products as a no- name beginner, it's all there. The economics are fascinating and the  profits can be astounding.  In the meantime, we will focus on the least complicated and most  profitable option open to the most people: product creation.  Option Three: Create a Product  Creation is a better means of self-expression than possession; it  is through creating, not possessing, that life is revealed. —VIDA  D. SCUDDER, The Life of the Spirit in the Modern English  Poets  reating a product is not complicated. "Create" sounds more  involved than it actually is. If the idea is a hard product—an  invention— it is possible to hire mechanical engineers or industrial  designers on www .elance.com to develop a  29. This also refers to owners of copyrights or trademarks. C  ======================================== [Página 167] ======================================== Income Autopilot I 155  prototype based on your description of its function and appearance,  which is then taken to a contract manufacturer. If you find a generic  or stock product made by a contract manufacturer that can be re- purposed or positioned for a special market, it's even easier: Have  them manufacture it, stick a custom label on it for you, and presto- new product. This latter example is often referred to as "private  labeling." Have you ever seen a chiropractor's office with its own  line of vitamin products or the Kirkland brand at Costco? Private  labeling in action.  It is true that we'll be testing market response without manufac- turing, but if the test is successful, manufacturing is the next step.  This means we need to keep in mind setup costs, per-unit costs, and  order minimums. Innovative gadgets and devices are great but often  require special tooling, which makes the manufacturing start-up costs  too expensive to meet  our criteria.  Putting mechanical devices aside and forgetting about welding  and engineering, there is one class of product that meet s all of our  criteria, has a manufacturing lead time of less than a week in small  quantities, and often permits not just an 8-10 x markup, bu t a 20-50 x  markup.  No, not heroin or slave labor. Too much bribing and human  interaction required.  Information.  Information products are low-cost, fast to manufacture, and time- consuming for competitors to duplicate. Consider that the top-selling  non-information infomercial products—whether exercise equipment  or supplements—have a useful life span of two to four months before  imitators flood the market. I studied economics in Beijing for six  months and observed firsthand how the latest Nike sneaker or  Callaway golf club could be duplicated and on eBay within a week of  first appearing on shelves in the United States. This is not an  exaggeration, and I am not talking about a look-alike product— I  mean an exact duplicate for /20 the cost.  ======================================== [Página 168] ======================================== 156 STEP III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  Information, on the other hand, is too time-consuming for most  knockoff artists to bother with when there are easier products to  replicate. It's easier to circumvent a patent than to paraphrase an  entire course to avoid copyright infringement. Three of the most  successful television products of all time—all of which have spent  more than 300 weeks on the infomercial top-10 bestseller lists—  reflect the competitive and profit margin advantage of information  products.  No Down Payment (Carlton Sheets)  Attacking Anxiety and Depression (Lucinda Bassett)  Personal Power (Tony Robbins)  I know from conversations with the principal owners of one of the  above products that more than $65 million worth of information  moved through their doors in 2002. Their infrastructure consisted of  fewer than 25 in-house operators, and the rest of the infrastructure,  ranging from media purchasing to shipping, was outsourced.  Their annual revenue-per-employee is over $2.7 million plus.  Incredible.  On the opposite end of the market size spectrum, I know a man  who created a low-budg et how-to DVD  for less than $200  and sold it  to owners of storage facilities who wanted to install security systems.  It's hard to get more niche than that. In 2001,  selling DVDs  that cost  $2 to duplicate for $95 apiece through trade magazines, he made  several hundred thousand dollars with no employees.  But I'm Not an Expert!  f you aren't an expert, don't sweat it. First, "expert" in the context of  selling product means that you know more about the topic than the  purchaser. No more. It is not necessary to be the best—just better  than a small target number of your prospective customers. Let's  suppose that your current I  ======================================== [Página 169] ======================================== Income Autopilot I 157  dreamline—to compete in the 1,150-mile Iditarod dogsledding race  in Alaska—requires $5,000 to realize. If there are 15,000 readers and  even 50 (0.003%) can De convinced of your superior expertise in skill X  and spend $100 for a program that teaches it, that is $5,000.  Bring on  the Huskies. Those 50 customers are what I call the "minimal  customer base"—the minimum number of customers you need to  convince of your expertise to fulfill a given dreamline.  Second, expert status can be created in less than four weeks if you  understand basic credibility indicators and what people are  conditioned to equate with proof of superior knowledge. See the  boxed text in this chapter to learn how.  The degree to which you personally need expert status also de- pends on how you obtain your content. There are three main options.  1. Create the content yourself, often via paraphrasing and com- bining points from several books on a topic.  2. Repurpose content that is in the public domain and not subject  to copyright protection, such as government documents and  mate rial that predates modern copyright law.  3. License content or compensate an expert to help create con- tent. Fees can be one-time and paid up front or royalty-based  (5-10% of net revenue, for example).  If you choose option 1 or 2, you need expert status within a limited  market.  Let's assume you are a real estate broker and have determined  that, like yourself, most brokers want a simple but good website to  promote themselves and their businesses. If you read and understand  the three top-selling books on home-page design, you will know  more about that topic than 80% of the readership of a magazine for  real estate brokers. If you can summa rize the content and make  recomme ndations specific to the needs of the real estate market, a  0.5-1.5%  response from an ad you place in the magazine is not  unreasonable to expect.  ======================================== [Página 170] ======================================== 158 STEP III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  Use the following questions to brainstorm potential how-to or  informational products that can be sold to your markets using your  expertise or borrowed expertise. Aim for a combination of formats  that will lend itself to $50-200 pricing, such as a combination of two  CDs (30-90 minutes each), a 40-page transcription of the CDs, and a  10-page quickstart guide.  1. How can you tailor a general skill for your market—what I  call "niching down"—or add to what is being sold successfully in  your target magazines? Think narrow and deep rather than broad.  2. What skills are you interested in that you—and others in your  markets—would pay to learn? Become an expert in this skill for  yourself and then create a product to teach the same. If you need  help or want to speed up the process, consider the next question.  3. What experts could you interview and record to create a  sellable audio CD? These people do not need to be the best, but  just better than most. Offer them a digital master copy of the  interview to do with or sell as they like (this is often enough)  and/or offer them a small up-front or ongoing royalty payment.  Use Skype.com with HotRecorder (more on these and related  tools in Tools and Tricks) to record these conversations directly to  your PC and send the mp3 file to an online transcription service.  4. Do you have a failure-to-success story that could be turned  into a how-to product for others? Consider problems you've  overcome in the past, both professional and personal.  ======================================== [Página 171] ======================================== Income Autopilot I 159  The Expert Builder: How to Become a Top  Expert in 4 Weeks  t's time to obliterate the cult of the expert. Let the PR world scorn me. First and  foremost, there is a difference between being perceived as an expert and being  one. In the context of business, the former is what sells product and the latter,  relative to your "minimal customer base," is what creates good products and  prevents returns.  It is possible to know all there is to know about a subject— medicine, for  example—but if you don't have M.D. at the end of your name, few will listen. The  M.D. is what I term a "credibility indicator." The so-called expert with the most  credibility indicators is the one who will sell the most product, not the one with the  most knowledge of a topic.  How, then, do we go about acquiring credibility indicators in the least time  possible?  It took a friend of mine just three weeks to become a "top relationship expert  who, as featured in Glamour and other national media, has counseled executives  at Fortune 500 companies on how to improve their relationships in 24 hours or  less." How did she do it?  She followed a few simple steps that created a credibility snowball effect.  Here's how you can do the same.  1. Join two or three related trade organizations with official-sounding  names. In her case, she chose the Association for Conflict Resolution  (www .acrnet.org) and The International Foundation for Gender Education  (www .ifge.org). This can be done online in five minutes with a credit card.  2. Read the three top-selling books on your topic (search historical New  York Times bestseller lists online) and summarize each on one page.  3. Give one free one-to-three-hour seminar at the closest well-known  university, using posters to advertise. Then do the same at branches of two  well-known big companies (AT&T , IBM, etc.) located in the same area. Tell  the company that you have given seminars at University X or X College and  are a member of those groups from step 1. Emphasize that you are offering it  to them for I ======================================== [Página 172] ======================================== 160 STEP  III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  free to get additional speaking experience outside of academics and will not  be selling products or services. Record the seminars from two angles for  later potential use as a CD/DVD product.  4. Optional: Offer to write one or two articles for trade magaz ines  related to your topics, citing what you have accomplished in steps 1 and 3 for  credibility. If they decline, offer to interview a known expert and write the  article—it still gets your name listed as a contributor.  5. Join ProfNet, which is a service that journalists use to find experts to  quote for articles. Getting PR is simple if you stop shouting and start  listening. Use steps 1, 3, and 4 to demonstrate credibility and online  research to respond to journalist queries. Done properly, this will get you  featured in media ranging from small local publications to the New York  Times and ABC News.  Becoming a recognized expert isn't difficult, so I want to remove that barrier  now.  I am not recommending pretending to be something you're not. I can't!  "Expert" is nebu lous media-speak and so overused as to be indefinable. In  modern PR terms, proof of expertise in most fields is shown with group  affiliations, client lists, writing credentials, and media mentions, not \Q points or  Ph.D.s.  Presenting the truth in the best light, but not fabricating it, is the name of the  game.  See you on CNN.   -Q&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS  or this hands-on chapter, the Q&A is simple. In fact, it's more like  a Q.  The question is, "Did you read the chapter and follow the direc- tions?" If not, do it!

I use this type of lead-in whenever making off-the-wall requests. It softens it and  makes the person curious enough to listen before spitting out an automatic "no."  32. This answers the questions they'll have in their head: "Who are you and why are  you calling now?" I like to be a "first-time" something to play the sympathy card, and I  find a recent media feature online to cite as the trigger for calling.  33. I call people I'm familiar with. If you can't call yourself a longtime fan, tell them that  you have followed the mentor's career or business exploits for a certain number of  years.  34. Don't pretend to be strong.

Prospects would leave their contact information, and  based on the number of callers or response to a follow-up sales letter,  the product would be abandon ed or manufactured.  In the Internet era, there are better tools that are both cheaper and  faster. We'll test the product ideas from the last chapter on Google  Adwords—the largest and most sophisticated Pay-Per-Click (PPC)  engine—in five days for $500  or less. PPC here refers to the  highlighted search results that are listed above and to the right of  normal search results on Google. Advertisers pay to have these ads  displayed when people search for a certain term related to the adver- tisers' product, such as "cognitive supplement," and are charged a  small fee from $.05 to over $1 each time someone clicks through to  their site.

The basic test process consists of three parts, each of which is  covered in this chapter.  39. It can be illegal to charge customers prior to shipment—so we will not charge  customers—but it is still common practice. Why do so many commercials state "allow  three to four weeks for delivery" if it only takes three to five days for a shipment to get  from New York to California? It gives the companies time to manufacture product and  use customers' credit card payments to finance it. Clever but often against the law. M ======================================== [Página 180] ======================================== 168 STEP III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  Best: Look at the competition and create a more-compelling  offer on a basic one-to-three-page website (one to three  hours). Test: Test the offer using short Google Adwords  advertising  campaigns (three hours to set up and five days of passive  observation). Divest or Invest: Cut losses with losers and  manufacture the  winner(s) for sales rollout.  Let's use two people, Sherwood and Johanna, and their two  product ideas—French sailor shirts and a how-to yoga DVD for rock  climbers—as case studies of what the testing steps look like and how  you can do the same.   Sherwood bought a striped sailing shirt in France while traveling  last summe r, and upon returning to NYC has been continually  approached by 20-30-year-old males on the street who want to know  where to get their own. Sensing an opportunity, he requests back  issues of NYC-based weekly magazines aimed at this demographic  and calls the manufacturer in France for pricing. He learns that he  can purchase shirts at a wholesale price of $20 that sell for $100  retail. He adds $5 per shirt to account for shipping to the United  States and arrives at a per-shirt cost of $25. It's not quite our ideal  markup (4 x vs. 8-10 x), but he wants to test the product regardless.  Johanna is a yoga instructor who has noticed her growing client  base of rock climbers. She is also a rock climber and is considering  creating a yoga instructional DVD tailored to that sport, which would  include a 20-page spiral-bound manual and be priced at $80. She  predicts that production of a low-budg et first edition of the DVD  would cost nothing more than a borrowed camera, one 90-minute  digital tape, and a friend's iMac for simple editing. She can burn  small quantities of this first-edition DVD—no  menus, just straight  footage and titles—on the laptop and create labels with freeware  from www .download.com. She has contacted a duplication house  ======================================== [Página 181] ======================================== Income Autopilot II 169  and learned that more-professional DVDs will cost $3-5 apiece to  duplicate in small quantities (minimum of 250),  including cases.  Now that they have ideas and estimates of start-up costs, what  next?  Besting the Competition  First and foremost, each product must pass a competitive litmus test.  How can Sherwood and Johanna beat the competition and offer a  superior product or guarantee?  1. Sherwood and Johanna Google the top terms each would use to  try and find their respective products. To come up with related  terms and derivative terms, both use search term suggestion tools.  Overture: http://inventory.overture.eom/d/searchinventory/  suggestion/ Google:  https://adwords.google.com/select/main?cmd=  KeywordSandbox Ask.com: www.ask.com (type in one  term and see "narrow  your search," "expand your search," and "related terms"  on the right side)  Both then visit the three websites that consistently appear in  top search and PPC positions. How can Sherwood and Johanna  differentiate themselves?  "Use more credibility indicators? (media, academia,  associations, and testimonials)  "Create a better guarantee? "Offer  better selection?40 "Free or faster  shipping?  Sherwood notices that the shirts are often hard to find on the  40. This applies to Sherwood and not Johanna.  ======================================== [Página 182] ======================================== 170 STEP III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  competitive sites, all of which feature dozens of products, and the  shirts are either made in the United States (inauthentic) or  shipped from France (customers must wait two to four weeks).  Johanna cannot find a "yoga for rock climbing" DVD, so she is  starting from a blank slate.  2. Sherwood and Johanna now need to create a one-page (300- 600 words) testimonial-rich advertisement that emphasizes their  differentiators and product benefits using text and either personal  photos or stock photos from stock photo websites. Both have  spent two weeks collecting advertisements that have prompted  them to make purchases or that have caught their attention in  print or online—these will serve as models.41 Johanna asks her  clients for testimonials and Sherwood lets his friends try on the  shirts to get several for his page. Sherwood also asks the manu- facturer for photos and advertising samples.  See www .pxmethod.com for a good example of how I have  created a test page using testimonials from seminar attendees.  Free how-to seminars as recomme nded in the Expert Builder are  ideal for identifying popular selling points and securing  testimonials.  Testing the Advertisement  Sherwood and Johanna now need to test actual customer response to  their advertisements. Sherwood first tests his concept with a 48-hour  eBay auction that includes his advertising text. He sets the "reserve"  (the lowest price he'll accept) for one shirt at $50 and cancels the  auction last minute to avoid legal issues since he doesn't have  product to ship. He has received bids up to $75 and decides to  41. How did I come up with the most successful BodyQUICK headline ("The Fastest  Way to Increase Power and Speed Guaranteed")? I borrowed it from the longest- running, and thus most profitable, Rosetta Stone headline: "The Fastest Way to Learn  a Language Guaranteed™" Reinventing the wheel is expensive—become an astute  observer of what is already working and adapt it.  ======================================== [Página 183] ======================================== Income Autopilot II 171  move to the next phase of testing. Johanna doesn't feel comfortable  with the apparent deception and skips this preliminary testing.  Sherwood's cost: <$5.  Both find a low-cost provider such as www .bluehost.com to host  their soon-to-be one-page site. Bluehost includes one domain name  with the hosting; Sherwood chooses www .shirtsfromfrance. com and  Johanna chooses ww w.yogaclimber.com. For additional domain  names, Johanna uses the cheap domain registrar www .  domainsinseconds.com.  Cost to both: <$40.   Sherwood uses Dreamweaver to create his one-page site adver- tisement and then creates two additional pages. If someone clicks on  the "purchase" button at the bottom of the first page, it takes them to  a second page with pricing, shipping and handling,42 and basic  contact fields to fill out (including e-mail and phone). If the visitor  presses "continue with order," it takes them to a page that states,  "Unfortunately, we are currently on back order but will contact you  as soon as we have product in stock. Thank you for your patience."  This structure allows him to test the first-page ad and his pricing  separately. If someone gets to the last page, it is considered an order.  Johanna is not comfortable with "dry testing," as Sherwood's  approach is known, even though it is legal if the billing data isn't  captured. She instead hires a designer from www .elance.com for  $100  to create a single webpage with the content of her one-page ad  and an e-mail sign-up for a free "top 10 tips" list for using yoga for  rock climbing. She will consider 60% of the sign-ups as hypothetical  orders.  Cost to both: <$i50.  Both set up simple Google Adwords campaigns with 50-100  search terms to simultaneously test headlines while driving traffic  42. Sherwood includes shipping and handling prior to the final order page so that  people don't finalize the order just to confirm total pricing. He wants his "orders" to  reflect real orders and not price checkers.  ======================================== [Página 184] ======================================== 172 STEP III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  to their pages. Their daily budg et limits are set at $50 per day. (At  this segue into PPC testing. I recomme nd you first visit www .  google.com/onhnebusiness and then follow along by creating your  own account, which should take about 10 minutes. It would be a  waste of rain forests to use ten pages to explain terms that can be  understood at a glance online.)  Sherwood and Johanna decide on the best search terms by using  the search term suggestion tools mentioned earlier. Both aim for spe- cific terms when possible ("french sailor shirts" vs. "french shirts";  "yoga for sports" vs. "yoga") for higher conversion rates (the per- centage of visitors that purchase) and lower cost-per-click (CPC).  They aim also for second through fourth positioning, but no more  than$.20 CPC.  Sherwood will use Google's free analytical tools to track "orders"  and page abandon ment rates—what percentage of visitors leave the  site from which pages. Johanna will use www.aweber.com to track e- mail sign-ups. Since both Sherwood and Johanna are unsure of how  to implement these tools, they hire freelance Web programme rs to set  them up.  Cost to both: $100.   Both Johanna and Sherwood design Adwords ads that focus on  their differentiators. Each Google Adwords ad consists of a headline  and then two lines of description, neither of which can exceed 35  characters. In Sherwood's case, he creates five groups of 10 search  terms each. The following are two of his ads.  SAILOR SHIRTS FROM FRANCE  REA L FRENCH  SAILOR SHIRTS  French Quality, Shipped from U.S. French Quality, Shipped from U.S.  Lifetime Guarantee! Lifetime Guarantee!  www .shirtsfromfrance.com www .shirtsfromfrance.com  Johanna creates the same five groups of 10 terms each and tests a  number of ads, including these:  ======================================== [Página 185] ======================================== Income Autopilot II 173  YOGA FOR ROCK CLIMBERS Y OGA FOR ROCK CLIMBERS  DVD Used by 5.12 Climbers DVD  Used by 5.12 Climbers  Get Flexible Fast! Get Flexible Fast!  www.yogac limber.com www .yogaforsports.com  Notice that these ads can be used to test not just headlines but  guarantees, product names, and domain names. It's as simple as  creating several ads, rotated automatically by Google, that are iden- tical except for the one variable to be tested. How do you think I de- termined the best title for this book?   Both Sherwood and Johanna disable the feature on Google that  serves only the best-performing ad. This is necessary to later com- pare the click-through rates from each and combine the best elements  (headline, domain name, and body text) into a final ad.  Last but not least, ensure that the ads don't trick prospects into  visiting the site. The product offer should be clear. Our goal is quali- fied traffic, so we do not want to offer something "free" or otherwise  attract window shoppers or the curious who are unlikely to buy.  Cost to both: $50 or less per day x 5 days = $250.43  Investing or Divesting  Five days later, it's time to tally the results.  What can we consider a "good" click-through and conversion  rate? This is where the math can be deceiving. If we're selling a  $10,000  abominable snowman suit with an 80% profit margin, we  obviously need a much lower conversion rate than someone who is  43. Keeping in mind that 100 specific terms at $0.10 per click will perform better than  10 broad terms at $1.00 per click, the more you spend, and thus the more traffic you  drive, the more statistically valid the results will be. If budg et permits, increase the  number of related terms and daily expenditure so that the entire PPC test costs $500- 1,000.  ======================================== [Página 186] ======================================== 174 STEP III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  selling a $50 DVD  with a 70% profit margin. For sophisticated tools  and free spreadsheets that do all sorts of calculations for you, visit  www .fourhourworkweek.com.  Johanna and Sherwood decide to keep it simple at this stage: How  much did they spend on PPC ads and how much did they "sell"?  Johanna has done well. The traffic wasn't enough to make the test  stand up to statistical scrutiny, but she spent about $200 on PPC and  got 14 sign-ups for a free 10-tip report. If she assumes 60% would  purchase, that means 8.4 people x $75 profit per DVD  = $630 in  hypothetical total profit. This is also not taking into account the  potential lifetime value of each customer.  The results of her small test are no guarantee of future success,  but the indications are positive enough that she decides to set up a  Yahoo Store for $99 per month and a small per-transaction fee. Her  credit isn't excellent, so she will opt to use www .paypal.com to  accept credit cards online instead of approaching her bank for a  merchant account.44 She e-mails the 10-tip report to those who  signed up and asks for their feedback and recomme ndations for  content on the DVD. Ten days later, she has a first attem pt at the  DVD  ready to ship and her store is online. Her sales to the original  sign-ups cover costs of production and she is soon selling a  respectable 10 DVD s per week ($750 profit) via Google Adwords  and Overture, the second-largest PPC engine. She plans to test-print  advertising in niche magazines and now needs to create an automa- tion architecture to remove herself from the equation.  Sherwood didn't fare as well but still sees potential. He spent  $150  on PPC and "sold" three shirts for a hypothetical $225  in profit.  He had more than enough traffic, but the bulk of visitors left the site  on the pricing page. Rather than drop pricing, he decides to test a "2x  money-back guarantee" on the pricing page, which will  44. This is a checking account for receiving credit card payments.  ======================================== [Página 187] ======================================== Income Autopilot II 175  enable customers to get a $200  refund if the $100 shirts aren't the  "most comfortable they've ever owned." He retests and "sells" seven  shirts for $525 in profit. Based on these results, he sets up a merchant  account through his bank to process credit cards, orders a dozen  shirts from France, and sells them all over the following ten days.  This gives him enough profit to buy a small display ad at 50% off  (asking for a "first-time advertiser discount" and then citing a  competing magazine to get another 20% off) in a local weekly art  magazine, in which he calls the shirt "Jackson Pollock Shirts." He  orders two dozen more shirts with net-30 payment terms and puts a  toll-free number45 in the print ad that forwards to his cell phone. He  does this instead of using a website for two reasons: (1) He wants to  determine the most common questions for his FAQ online, and (2) he  wants to test an offer of $100 for one shirt ($75 in profit) or "buy  two, get one free" ($200 - $75 =  $125 profit).  He sells all 24 shirts in the first five days the magazine runs, most  through the special offer. Success. He redesigns the print ad, putting  answers to common questions in the text to cut down on calls for  information, and decides to negotiate a longer-term ad agreeme nt  with the magazine. He sends his sales rep a check for four issues at  30% of their published rates. He calls to confirm that they received  his check via FedEx and, with check in hand and deadlines looming,  they don't refuse.  Sherwood wants to go to Berlin during a two-week break from  his job, which he is now considering quitting. How can he roll out  his success and escape his own company? He needs to build the  architecture and get his mobile M.B.A.  That's where the next chapter comes in.  45.

How did he test the  idea and go from $o to $10,000 per month in the process? He  followed these steps.  1. Market Selection  He chose music and television producers as his market because  he is a musician himself and has used these products.  2. Product Brainstorm  He chose the most popular products available for resale from the  largest manufacturers of sound libraries and arranged a wholesale  purchase and drop-ship agreeme nt with them. Many of these  libraries cost well above $300 (up to $7,500), and this is precisely  why he needs to answer more customer-service questions than  someone with a lower-priced product of $50-200.  3. Micro-Testing  He auctioned the products on eBay to test demand (and the  highest possible pricing) before purchasing inventory. He ordered  product only when people placed orders from him, and product  shipped imme diately from the manufacturers' warehouses. Based  on this demand confirmed on eBay, Doug created a Yahoo Store  with these products and began testing Google Adwords and other  PPC search engines.  4. Rollout and Automation  Following this testing, and upon generating sufficient cash flow,  Doug began experimenting with print advertising in trade maga- zines. Simultaneously, he streamlined and outsourced operations  to reduce his time requirements from two hours per day to two  hours per week.

On Saturday and Sunday, go to a farmers' market or other outdoor  event where goods are sold. If this isn't possible, go to small  independent retailers (not chains or mass retail).  Set a budg et of $100  for your negotiating tuition and look for  items to purchase that total at least $150. Your job is to get the sell- ers down to a total of $100 or less for the lot. It is better to practice  on many cheap items rather than a few big items. Be sure to reply to  their first offer with, "What type of discount can you offer?" to let  them negotiate against themselves. Negotiate near closing time,  choose your objective price, bracket, and make a firm offer with cash  in hand for that amount.46 Practice  walking away if your objective  price isn't met. On Monday, call two magazines (expect the first to  be awkward) and use the script on the companion site to negotiate,  minus the last firm offer. Get them as low as possible and then call  them back later to indicate that your proposal was refused by upper  management or otherwise vetoed.  This is the negotiating equivalent of paper trading.47 Get used to  refusing offers and countering in person and—most importantly—  on the phone.  46.

His  company has increased its annual revenue 30% per year since it all began,  and he is able to spend more time with his three daughters than he ever  thought possible.  The experiment? As CEO of Applegate Farms, he insists on spending  just one day per week at the company headquarters in Bridgewater, New  Jersey. He's not the only CEO who spends time at home, of course—there  are hund reds who have heart attacks or nervous breakdowns and need time  to recover—but there is a huge difference. McDonnell has been doing it for  more than 17 years. Rarer still, he started doing it just six months after  founding the company.  49.

Limiting contact with  managers forces the entrepreneur to develop operational rules that  enable others to deal with problems themselves instead of calling for  help.  This isn't just for small operations. Applegate Farms sells more  than 120 organic and natural meat  products to high-end retailers and  generates more than $35 million in revenue per year.  It is all possible because McDonnell started with the end in mind.  Behind the Scenes: The Muse Architecture  Orders are nobody can see the Great Oz!

Infamous deal-maker Wayne Huizenga copied the org chart of  McDonald's to turn Blockbuster into a billion-dollar behemoth, and  dozens of titans have done much the same. In our case, it's the "end  in mind" that is different. Our goal isn't to create a business that is as  large as possible, but rather a business that bothers us as little as  possible. The architecture has to place us out of the information flow  instead of putting us at the top of it.  I didn't get this right the first time I tried.  In 2003,1  was interviewed in my home office for a documentary  called As Seen on TV. We were interrupted every 20-30 seconds with  beeping e-mail notifications, IM pings, and ringing phon es.

Here is what the general profit- loss might look like for a hypothetical $80 product sold via phone and developed  with the help of an expert, who is paid a royalty. I recommend calculating profit  margins using higher-than-anticipated expenses. This will account for unforeseen  costs (read: screwups) and miscellaneous fees such as monthly reports, etc.  REVE NUE _________ _______ ______ ______ _______ _______ ____  Product cost.......................................................................... $80.00  Shipping/Handling..................................................................$12.95  Total Revenu e.....................................................................$92.95  EXPE NSES ____________________________________________________________  Product manufacturing   ........................................................$10.00  Call center ($0.83 per minute x average  call time of 4 minutes)........................................................ $3.32  Shipping...................................................................................$5.80  Fulfillment ($1.85 per package + $0.50 for  boxes/packing).................................................................. $2.35  Credit card processing (2.75% of $92.95)................................ $2.56  Returns + declined cards (6% of $92.95)   _______............... $5.58  Royalties (5% of wholesale price of $48 [$80 x .6])_________$2.40  Total expenses..................................................................... $32.01  PROFIT (revenue minus expenses)     ...........................$60.94  How do you factor in adve rtising cost? If a $1,000 ad or $1,000 in PPC  produces 50 sales, my advertising cost per order (CPO ) is $20. This makes the  actual per-unit profit $40.94.  I set a new goal after that experience, and when I was interviewed  six months later as a follow-up, one change was more pronounced  than all others: silence. I had redesigned the business from the ground  up so that I had no phon e calls to answer and no  e-mail to respond to. E  ======================================== [Página 199] ======================================== Income Autopilot III 187  I'm often asked how big my company is—how many people I  employ full-time. The answer is one. Most people lose interest at that  point. If someone were to ask me how many people run Brain- QUICKEN LLC, on the other hand, the answer is different: between  200 and 300.1 am the ghost in the machine.  From advertisements—print in this example—to a cash deposit in  my bank account, the diagram on page 185 is what a simplified  version of my architecture looks like, including some sample costs.  If you have developed a product based on the guidelines in the last  two chapters, it will plug into this structure hand-in-glove.  Where am I in the diagram? Nowhere.  I am not a tollbooth through which anything needs to pass. I am  more like a police officer on the side of the road who can step in if  need be, and I use detailed reports from outsourcers to ensure the  cogs are moving as intended. I check reports from fulfillment each  Monday and monthly reports from the same the first of each month.  The latter reports include orders received from the call center, which  I can compare to the call center bills to gauge profit. Otherwise, I just  check bank accounts online on the first and fifteenth of each month  to look for odd deductions. If I find something, one e-mail will fix it,  and if not, it's back to kendo, painting, hiking, or whatever I happen  to be doing at the time.  Removing Yourself from the Equation:  When and How  The system is the solution. —AT&T  he diagram on page 185 should be your rough blueprint for  designing a self-sustaining virtual architecture. There could be  differences—more or fewer elements—but the main principles are  the same: T  ======================================== [Página 200] ======================================== 188 STEP III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  1. Contract outsourcing companies that specialize in one func- tion vs. freelancers whenever possible so that if someone is fired,  quits, or doesn't perform, you can replace them without inter- rupting your business. Hire trained groups of people who can  provide detailed reporting and replace one another as needed.  2. Ensure that all outsourcers are willing to communicate among  themselves to solve problems, and give them written permission  to make most inexpensive decisions without consulting you first (I  started at less than $ioo and moved to $400  after two months).  How do you get there? It helps to look at where entrepreneurs  typically lose their momentum and stall permanently.  Most entrepreneurs begin with the cheapest tools available,  bootstrapping and doing things themselves to get up and running  with little cash. This isn't the problem. In fact, it's necessary so that  the entrepreneurs can train outsourcers later. The problem is that  these same entrepreneurs don't know when and how to replace  themselves or their homema de infrastructure with something more  scalable.  By "scalable," I mean a business architecture that can handle  10,000  orders per week as easily as it can handle 10 orders per week.  Doing this requires minimizing your decision-making re- sponsibilities, which achieves our goal of time freedom while setting  the stage for doubling and tripling income with no change in hours  worked.  Call the companies at the end of the chapter to research costs.  Plan and budg et accordingly to upgrade infrastructure at the fol- lowing milestones, which I measure in units of product shipped:  Phase I: 0-50 Total Units of Product Shipped   Do it all yourself. Put your phone number on the site for both general  questions and order-taking—this is important in the beginning— and  take customer calls to determine common questions that you  ======================================== [Página 201] ======================================== Income Autopilot III 189  will answer later in an online FAQ. This FAQ will also be the main  mate rial for training phone operators and developing sales scripts.  Is PPC, an offline advertisement, or your website too vague or  misleading, thus attracting unqualified and time-consuming con- sumers? If so, change them to answer common questions and make  the product benefits (including what it isn't or doesn't do) clearer.  Answer all e-mail and save your responses in one folder called  "customer service questions." CC yourself on responses and put the  nature of the customers' questions in the subject lines for future in- dexing. Personally pack and ship all product to determine the cheap- est options for both. Investigate opening a merchant account from  your local small bank (easier to get than with a larger bank) for later  outsourced credit card processing.  Phase II: >10 Units Shipped Per Week  Add the extensive FAQ to your website and continue to add answers  to common questions as received. Find local fulfillment companies in  the yellow pages under "fulfillment services" or "mailing services." If  you cannot find one there or at www.mfsanet.org, call local printers  and ask them for recommendations. Narrow the field to those (often  the smallest) who will agree not to charge you setup fees and  monthly minimums. If this isn't possible, ask for at least 50% off  both and then request that the setup fee be applied as an advance  against shipping or their other fees.  Limit the candidates further to those who can respond to order  status e-mail (ideal) or phone calls from customers. The e-mail from  your "customer service" folder will be provided as copy-and-paste  responses, especially those related to order status and refund  requests.50  To lower or eliminate miscellaneous fees, explain that you are a  50. Sample e-mail responses for fulfillment purposes can be found at www .  fourhourworkweek.com.  ======================================== [Página 202] ======================================== 190 STEP III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  start-up and that your budg et is small. Tell them you need the cash  for advertising that will drive more shipments. If needed, mention the  competitive companies that you are considering and pit them against  one another, using lower pricing or concessions from one to get  larger discounts and bonuses from the others.  Before making your final selection, ask for at least three client  references and use the following to elicit the negatives: "I understand  they're good, but everyone has weaknesses. If you had to point out  where you've had some issues and what they're not the best at, what  would you say? Can you please describe an incident or a dis- agreeme nt? I expect these with all companies, so it's no big deal, and  it's confidential, of course."  Ask for "net-30 terms"—payment for services 30 days after  they're rendered—after one month of prompt payment for their  services. It is easier to negotiate all of the above points with smaller  operations that need the business. Have your contract manufacturer  ship product directly to the fulfillment house once you have decided  on one and put the fulfillment house's e-mail (you can use an e-mail  address at your domain and forward it) or phone number on the  online "thank you" page for order status questions.  Phase III: >20 Units Shipped Per Week  Now you will have the cash flow to afford the setup fees and the  monthly minimums that bigger, more sophisticated outsourcers will  ask for. Call the end-to-end fulfillment houses that handle it all— from order status to returns and refunds. Interview them about costs  and ask them for referrals to call centers and credit card processors  they've collaborated with for file transfers and problem solving.  Don't assemble an architecture of strangers—there will be  programm ing costs and mistakes, both of which are expensive.  Set up an account with the credit card processor first, for which  you will need your own merchant account. This is critical, as the ful- fillment house can only handle refunds and declined cards for trans-  ======================================== [Página 203] ======================================== Income Autopilot III 191  actions they process themselves through an outsourced credit card  processor.  Optionally, set up an account with one of the call centers your  new fulfillment center recomme nds. These will often have toll-free  numbers you can use instead of purchasing your own. Look at the  percentage split of online to phone orders during testing and consider  carefully if the extra revenue from the latter is worth the hassle. It  often isn't. Those who call to order will generally order online if  given no other option.  Before signing on with a call center, get several 800 numbers they  answer for current clients and make test calls, asking difficult  product-related questions and gauging sales abilities. Call each num- ber at least three times (morning, afternoon , and evening) and note  the make-or-break factor: wait time. The phone should be answered  within three to four rings, and if you are put on hold, the shorter the  wait the better. More than 15 seconds will result in too many aban- doned calls and waste advertising dollars.  The Art of Undecision: Fewer  Options = More Revenue  Companies go out of business when they make the wrong decisions  or, just as important, make too many decisions. The latter creates  complexity.  —MIKE MAPLES, cofounder of Motive Communications (IPO to $260  million market cap), founding executive of Tivoli (sold to IBM for  $750 million), and investor in companies such as Digg.com  Toseph Sugar man is the marketing genius behind dozens of direct-  I response and retail successes, including the BluBlocker sunglasses  phenomenon. Prior to his string of home runs on television (he sold  20,000  pairs of BluBlockers within 15 minutes of his first QVC  ======================================== [Página 204] ======================================== 192 STEP III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  appearance), his domain was print media, where he made millions  and built an empire called JS&A Group. He was once recruited to  design an advertisement for a manufacturer's watch line. The manu- facturer wanted to feature nine different watches in the ad, and Joe  recomme nded featuring just one. The client insisted and Joe offered  to do both and test them in the same issue ofThe Wall Street Journal.  The result? The one-watch offer outsold the nine-watch offer 6-to-i.51  Henry Ford once said, referring to his Model-T, the bestselling  car of all time,52 "The customer can have any color he wants, so long  as it's black." He understood something that businesspeople seem to  have forgotten: Serving the customer ("customer service") is not  becoming a personal concierge and catering to their every whim and  want. Customer service is providing an excellent product at an  acceptable price and solving legitimate  problems (lost packages, re- placeme nts, refunds, etc.) in the fastest manner possible. That's it.  The more options you offer the customer, the more indecision  you create and the fewer orders you receive—it is a disservice all  around. Furthermore, the more options you offer the customer, the  more manufacturing and customer service burden you create for  yourself.  The art of "undecision" refers to minimizing the number of deci- sions your customers can or need to make. Here are a few methods  that I and other NR have used to reduce service overhead 20-80%:  1. Offer one or two purchase options ("basic" and "premium,"  for example) and no more.  2. Do not offer multiple shipping options. Offer one fast method  instead and charge a premium.  3. Do not offer overnight or expedited shipping (it is possible to  refer them to a reseller who does, as is true with all of these  51. Joseph Sugarman, Advertising Secrets of the Written Word(De\S\ar Books, 1998 ).  52. Depending on whose math is used (number of cars vs. gross sales), some  claim the original Volkswagen Beetle holds the record.  ======================================== [Página 205] ======================================== Income Autopilot III 193  points), as these shipping methods will produce hundreds of  anxious phone calls.  4. Eliminate phone orders completely and direct all prospects to  online ordering. This seems outrageous until you realize that  success stories like Amazon.com have depended on it as a  fundamental cost-saver to survive and thrive.  5. Do not offer international shipments. Spending 10 minutes per  order filling out customs forms and then dealing with  customer complaints when the product costs 20-100%  more  with tariffs and duties is about as fun as headbutting a curb.  It's about as profitable, too.  Some of these policies hint at what is perhaps the biggest time- saver of all: customer filtering.  Not All Customers Are Created Equal  nce you reach Phase III and have some cash flow, it's time to re- evaluate your customers and thin the herd. There are good and  bad versions of all things: good  food,  bad food; good movies, bad mov- ies; good sex, bad sex; and, yes, good customers and bad customers.  Decide now to do business with the former and avoid the latter. I  recomme nd looking at the customer as an equal trading partner and  not as an infallible blessing of a human being to be pleased at all  costs. If you offer an excellent product at an acceptable price, it is an  equal trade and not a begging session between subordinate (you) and  superior (customer). Be professional but never kowtow to un- reasonable people.  Instead of dealing with problem customers, I recomme nd you  prevent them from ordering in the first place.  I know dozens of NR who don't accept Western Union or checks  as payment. Some would respond to this with, "You're giving up 10- 15% of your sales!" The NR, in turn, would say, "I am, but I'm O  ======================================== [Página 206] ======================================== 194 STEP III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  also avoiding the 10-15% of the customers who create 40% of the  expenses and eat 40% of my time." It's classic 80/20.  Those who spend the least and ask for the most before ordering  will do the same after the sale. Cutting them out is both a good  lifestyle decision and a good financial decision. Low-profit and high- maintenance customers like to call operators and spend up to 30  minutes on the phon e asking questions that are unimportant or  answered online, costing—in my case—$24.90  (30 x $0.83)  per 30- minute incident, eliminating the minuscule profit they contribute in  the first place.   Those who spend the most complain the least. In addition to our  premium $50-200 pricing, here are a few additional policies that  attract the high-profit and low-maintenance customers we want:  1. Do not accept payment via Western Union, checks, or money  order.  2. Raise wholesale minimums to 12-100 units and require a tax  ID number to qualify resellers who are real businesspeople  and not time-intensive novices. Don't run a personal business  school.  3. Refer all potential resellers to an online order form that must  be printed, filled out, and faxed in. Never negotiate pricing or  approve lower pricing for higher-volume orders. Cite "com- pany policy" due to having had problems in the past.  4. Offer low-priced products (a la MRI's NO2 book) instead of  free products to capture contact information for follow-up  sales. Offering something for free is the best way to attract  time-eaters and spend money on those unwilling to return the  favor.  5. Offer a lose-win guarantee (see boxed text) instead of free  trials.  6. Do not accept orders from common mail fraud countries such  as Nigeria.   ======================================== [Página 207] ======================================== Income Autopilot III 195  Make your customer base an exclusive club, and treat the mem- bers well once they've been accepted.  The Lose-Win Guarantee— How to  Sell Anything to Anyone   If you want a guarantee, buy a toaster.   —CLINT EASTWOOD  he 30-day money-back guarantee is dead. It just doesn't have the pizzazz it  once did. If a product doesn't work, I've been lied to and will have to spend an  afternoon at the post office to return it. This costs me more than just the price I  paid for the product, both in time and actual postage. Risk elimination just isn't  enough.  This is where we enter the neglected realm of lose-win guarantees and risk  reversal. The NR use what most consider an afterthought— the guarantee—as a  cornerstone sales tool.  The NR aim to make it profitable for the customer even if the product fails.  Lose-win guarantees not only remove risk for the consumer but put the company  at financial risk.  Here are a few examples of putting your money where your mouth is.  Delivered in 30 minutes or less or it's free!  (Domino's Pizza built its business on this guarantee.)  We're so confident you'll like CIALIS, if you don't we'll pay for the brand of  your choice.  (The "CIALIS® Promise Program" offers a free sample of CIALIS and then  offers to pay for competing products if CIALIS doesn't live up to the hype.)  If your car is stolen, we'll pay $500 of your insurance deductible.  (This guarantee helped THE CLUB become the #1-selling  mechanical automobile anti-theft device in the world.)  110% guaranteed to work within 60 minutes of the first dose.   (This was for BodyQUICK and a first among sports supplements. I offered to  not only refund customers the price of the product if it T  ======================================== [Página 208] ======================================== 196 STEP  III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  didn't work within 60 minutes of the first dose, but also to send them a check  for 10% more.)  The lose-win guarantee might seem like a big risk, especially when someone can  abuse it for profit like in the BodyQUICK example, but it isn't. . . //your product  delivers. Most people are honest.  Let's look at some actual numbers.  Returns for BodyQUICK, even with a 60-day return period (and partially  because of it53), are less than 3% in an indus try in which the average is 12-15%  for a normal 30-day 100% money-back guarantee. Sales increased more than  300% within four weeks of introducing the 110% guarantee, and returns  decreased overall.  Johanna adopted this lose-win offer and came up with "Increase sport- specific flexibility 40% in two weeks or return it for a full refund (including  shipping) and keep the 20-minute bonus DVD as our gift."  Sherwood found his guarantee as well: "If these shirts are not the most  comfortable you've ever worn, return them and get 2-times your purchase price  back. Each shirt is also guaranteed for life—if it gets threadbare, send it back and  we'll replace it free of charge."  Both of them increased sales more than 200% in the first two months. Return  percentage remained the same for Johanna and increased 50% for Sherwood,  from 2 to 3%. Disaster? Far from it. Instead of selling 50 and getting one back  with a 100% guarantee [(50 x $100) - $100  = $4,900 in revenue], he sold 200  and got six back with the 200% guarantee [(200 x $100 ) - (6 x $200 ) = $18,800 in  revenue]. I'll take the latter.  Lose-win is the new win-win. Stand out and reap the rewards.  53. For the benefit of the customer and to capitalize on universal laziness (me  included), provide as much time as possible to consider or forget the product.  Ginsu knives offered a 50-year guarantee.

I promise you new  muscles in days!  — CHAR LES ATLAS, strongman who sold more than $30 million worth  of "dynamic-tension" muscle courses through comic books  f approaching large resellers or potential partners, small company size will be  an obstacle. This discrimination is often as insurmountable as it is unfounded.  Fortunately, a few simple steps can dramatically upgrade your budding Fortune  500 image and take your muse from coffee shop to boardroom in 45 minutes or  less.  1. Don't be the CEO or founder.  Being the "CEO" or "Found er" screams start-up. Give yourself the mid-level  title of "vice president" (VP), "director," or something similar that can be  added to depending on the occasion (Director of Sales, Director of Business  Development, etc.). For negotiation purposes as well, remember that it is  best not to appear to be the ultimate decision-maker.  2. Put multiple e-mail and phone contacts on the website.  Put various e-mail addresses on the "contact us" page for different  departments, such as "human resources," "sales," "general inquiries,"  "wholesale distribution," "media/PR," "investors," "Web comments," "order  status," and so on. In the beginning, these will all forward to your e-mail  address. In Phase III, most will forward to the appropriate outsourcers.  Multiple toll-free numbers can be used in the same fashion.  3. Set up an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) remote recep tionist.  It is possible to sound like a blue chip for less than $30. In fewer than ten  minutes on a site such as www .angel.com, which boasts clients such as  Reebok and Kellog's, it is possible to set up an 800 number that greets  callers with a voice prompt such as, "Thank I  ======================================== [Página 210] ======================================== 198 STEP  III: A IS FOR AUTOMATION  you for calling [business name]. Please say the name of the person or  department you would like to reach or just hold on for a list of options."  Upon speaking your name or selecting the appropriate department, the  caller is forwarded to your preferred phone or the appropriate outsourcer— with on-hold music and all.  4. Do not provide home addresses.   Do not use your home address or you will get visitors. Prior to securing an  end-to-end fulfillment house that can handle checks and money orders—if  you decide to accept them—use a post office box but leave out the "PO Box"  and include the street address of the post office itself. Thus "PO Box 555,  Nowhere, US 1193 6" becomes "Suite 555, 1234 Downtown Ave., US  11936."  Go forth and project professionalism with a well-designed image. Perceivedsize  does matter.  -COMFORT CHALLENGE  Relax in Public (2 days)  This is the last Comfort Challenge, placed prior to the chapter that  tackles the most uncomfortable turning point for most office  dwellers: negotiating remote work agreeme nts. This challenge is in- tended to be fun while showing—in no uncertain terms—that the  rules most follow are nothing more than social conventions. There  are no legal boundaries stopping you from creating an ideal life ... or  just being self-entertained and causing mass confusion.  So, relaxing in public. Sounds easy, right? I'm somewhat famous  for relaxing in style to get a laugh out of friends. Here is the deal,  and I don't care if you're male  or female, 20 or 60, Mongolian or  Martian. I call the following a "time-out."  Once per day for two days, simply lie down in the middle of a  crowded pub lic place at some point. Lunchtime is ideal. It can be a  ======================================== [Página 211] ======================================== Income Autopilot III 199  well-trafficked sidewalk, the middle of a popular Starbucks, or a popular  bar. There is no real technique involved. Just lie down and remain silent on  the ground  for about ten seconds, and then get up and continue on with  whatever you were doing before. I used to do this at nightclubs to clear  space for break-dancing circles. No one responded to pleading, but going  catatonic on the ground did the trick.  Don't explain it at all. If someone asks about it after the fact (he or she  will be too confused to ask you while you're doing it for io seconds), just  respond, "I just felt like lying down for a second." The less you say, the  funnier and more gratifying this will be. Do it on solo missions for the first  two days, and then feel free to do it when with a group of friends. It's a riot.  It isn't enough to think outside the box. Thinking is passive. Get used to  acting outside the box.  -TOOLS AND TRICKS  Looking Huge—Virtual Receptionist and IVR  "-Angel (www .angel.com) (888-692-6435)  Get an 800 number with professional voice menu (voice recognition de- partments, extensions, etc.) in five minutes.

Then a nod, a laugh, and a crooked smile of resignation.  "OK, then—it's fine."  And that was that, lickity-split. Forty-four-year old Dave Cama-rillo,  lifelong employee, had cracked the code and started his second life.  He hadn't been fired; he hadn't been yelled at. His boss seemed to be  handling the whole situation quite well. Granted, Dave delivered the good s  on the job, and it wasn't like he was doing naked snow angels in client  meetings, but still—he had just spent 30 days in China without telling  anyone.  "It wasn't half as hard as I though t it would be."  Dave works among more than 10,000 employees at Hewlett-  ======================================== [Página 220] ======================================== 208 STEP IV: L IS FOR LIBERATION  Packard (HP), and—against all odds—he actually likes it. He has no  desire to start his own company and has spent the last seven years  doing tech support for customers in 45 states and 22 countries. Six  months ago, however, he had a small problem.  She measured 5'2" and weighed no pounds.  Was he, like most men, afraid of commitment, unwilling to stop  running around the house in Spider-Man underoos, or inseparable  from the last refuge of any self-respecting man, the PlayStation? No,  he was past all that. In fact, Dave was locked and loaded, ready to pop  the big question, but he was short on vacation days and his girlfriend  lived out of town. Waaaaa y out of town—5,91 3 miles out of town.  He had met her on a client visit to Shenzhen, China, and it was  now time to meet  the parents, logistics be damned.  Dave had only recently begun to take tech calls at home, and, well,  isn't home where the heart is? One plane ticket and one T-Mobile  GSM  tri-band phone later, he was somewhere over the Pacific en  route to his first seven-day experiment. Twelve time zones hence, he  proposed, she accepted, and no one was the wiser stateside.  The second field trip was a 30-day tour of Chinese family and  food (pig face, anyone?), ending with Shumei Wu becoming Shu-mei  Camarillo. Back in Palo Alto, HP continued its quest for world  domination, neither knowing nor caring where Dave was. He had his  calls forwarded to his newly begotten wife's cell phone and all was  right in the world.  Now back in the United States after hoping for the best and  preparing for the worst, Dave had earned his Eagle Scout mobility  badge. The future looks flexible, indeed. He is going to start by  spending two months in China every summe r and then move to  Australia and Europe to make up for lost time, all with the full sup- port of his boss.  The key to cutting the leash was simple—he asked for forgive- ness instead of permission.  "I didn't travel for 30 years of my life—so why not?"  ======================================== [Página 221] ======================================== Disappea ring Act 209  THAT'S PRECISELY THE question everyone should be asking—why  the hell not?  From Caste to Castaway  he old rich, the upper class of yore with castles and ascots and  irritating little lapdogs, are characterized as being well- established in one place. The Schwarzes of Nantucket and the  McDonnells of Charlottesville. Blech. Summe rs in the Hamptons  issoooo o 1990s.  The guard is changing. Being bound to one place will be the new  defining feature of middle class. The New Rich are defined by a  more elusive power than simple cash—unrestricted mobility. This  jet-setting is not limited to start-up owners or freelancers. Employees  can pull it off, too.54  Not only can they pull it off, but more and more companies want  them to pull it off. BestBuy, the consumer electronics giant, is now  sending thousands of employees home from their HQ in Minnesota  and claims not only lowered costs, but also a 10-20% increase in re- sults. The new mantra is this: Work wherever and whenever you  want, but get your work done.  In Japan, a three-piece zombie who joins the 9-5 grind each  morning is called a sarari-man—salaryman—and, in the last few  years, a new verb has emerged: datsu-sara sum, to escape (datsu) the  salaryman (sara) lifestyle.  It's your turn to learn the datsu-sara dance.55  54. If you're an entrepreneur, don't skip this chapter. This introduction to remote  working tools and tactics is integral to the international pieces of the puzzle that follow.  55. This verb is used by Japanese women as well, even though female workers are  referred to as "OL"—office ladies. T  ======================================== [Página 222] ======================================== 210 STEP IV: L IS FOR LIBERATION  Trading Bosses for Beer:  An Oktoberfest Case Study  o create the proper leverage to be unshackled, we'll do two  things: demonstrate the business benefit of remote working and  make it too expensive or excruciating to refuse a request for it.  Remember Sherwood?  His French shirts are beginning to move and he is itching to ditch  the United States for a global walkabout. He has more than enough  cash now but needs to escape constant supervision in the office be- fore he can implement all the timesaving tools from Elimination and  travel.  He is a mechanical engineer and is producing twice as many  designs in half the time since erasing 90% of his time-wasters and  interruptions. This quantum leap in performance has been noticed by  his supervisors and his value to the company has increased, making it  more expensive to lose him. More value means more leverage for  negotiations. Sherwood has been sure to hold back some of his  productivity and efficiency so that he can highlight a sudden jump in  both during a remote work trial period.  Since eliminating most of his meet ings and in-person discussions,  he has naturally moved about 80% of all communication with his  boss and colleagues to e-mail and the remaining 20% to phone. Not  only this, but he has used tips from chapter 7, "Interrupting  Interruption and the Art of Refusal," to cut unimportant and repeti- tive e-mail volume in half. This will make the move to remote less  noticeable, if at all noticeable, from a managerial standpoint. Sher- wood is running at full speed with less and less supervision.  Sherwood implements his escape in five steps, beginning on July  12 during the slow business season and lasting two months, ending  with a trip to Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany, for two weeks as a  final test before bigger and bolder vagabonding plans. T  ======================================== [Página 223] ======================================== Disappea ring Act 211  Step 1: Increase Investment  First, he speaks with his boss on July 12 about additional training  that might be available to employees. He proposes having the com- pany pay for a four-week industrial design class to help him better  interface with clients, being sure to mention the benefit to the boss  and business (i.e., he'll decrease intradepartmental back-and-forth  and increase both client results and billable time). Sherwood wants  the company to invest as much as possible in him so that the loss is  greater if he quits.  Step 2: Prove Increased Output Offsite  Second, he calls in sick the next Tuesday and Wednesday, July 18  and 19, to showcase his remote working productivity.56 He decides  to call in sick between Tuesday and Thursday for two reasons: It  looks less like a lie for a three-day weekend and it also enables him to  see how well he functions in social isolation without the imminent  reprieve of the weekend. He ensures that he doubles his work output  on both days, leaves an e-mail trail of some sort for his boss to no- tice, and keeps quantifiable records of what he accomplished for  reference during later negotiations. Since he uses expensive CAD  software that is only licensed on his office desktop, Sherwood in- stalls a free trial of GoToMyPC remote access software so that he  can pilot his office computer from home.  Step 3: Prepare the Quantifiable Business Benefit  Third, Sherwood creates a bullet-point list of how much more he  achieved outside the office with explanations. He realizes that he  needs to present remote working as a good business decision and  56. Any reason to be home will do (cable or phone installation, home repairs, etc.) or,  if you prefer not to use a ruse, work a weekend or take two vacation days.  ======================================== [Página 224] ======================================== 212 STEP  IV: L IS FOR LIBERATION  not a personal perk. The quantifiable end result was three more de- signs per day than his usual average and three total hours of addi- tional billable client time. For explanations, he identifies removal of  commute and fewer distractions from office noise.  Step 4: Propose a Revocable Trial Period  Fourth, fresh off completing the comfort challenges from previous  chapters, Sherwood confidently proposes an innocent one-day-per- week remote work trial period for two weeks. He plans a script in  advance but does not make it a PowerPoint presentation or otherwise  give it the appearance of something serious or irreversible.57  Sherwood knocks on his boss's office door around 3 P.M. on a  relatively relaxed Thursday, July 27, the week after his absence, and  his script looks like the following. Stock phrases are underlined and  footnotes explain negotiating points.  Sherwood: Hi. Bill. Do you have a quick second?  Bill:  Sure. What's up?  Sherwood: I just wanted to bounce an idea off of you that's been on  my mind. Two minutes should be plenty.  Bill:  OK. Shoot.  Sherwood: Last week, as you know, I was sick. Long story short, I  decided to work at home despite feeling terrible. So here's the  funny part. I thought I would get nothing done, but ended up  finishing three more designs than usual on both days. Plus, I put  in three more billable hours than usual without the commute,  office noise, distractions, etc. OK, so here's where I'm going.  Just as a trial. I'd like to propose working from home Mondays  and Tuesdays for just two weeks. You can veto it whenever you  want, and I'll come in if we need to do meet ings, but I'd like to  try it for just two weeks and review the results.  57. Review the Puppy  Dog Close from "Income Autopilot II: Testing the Muse."  ======================================== [Página 225] ======================================== Disappea ring Act 213  I'm 100%  confident that I'll get twice as much done. Does that  seem reasonable?  Bill: Hmm... What if we need to share client designs?  Sherwood: There's a program called GoToMyPC that I used to ac- cess the office computer when I was sick. I can view everything  remotely, and I'll have my cell phone on me 24/7. Soooo o . ..  What do you think? Test it out starting next Monday and see  how much more I get done?58  Bill: Ummm  ... OK, fine. But it's just a test. I have a meet ing in five  and have to run, but let's talk soon.   Sherwood: Great. Thanks for the time. I'll keep you posted on it all.  I'm sure you'll be pleasantly surprised.  Sherwood didn't expect to get two days per week approved. He  asked for two so that, in the case his boss refused, he could ask for  just one as a fallback position (bracketing). Why didn't Sherwood go  for five days remote per week? Two reasons. First, it's a lot for  management to accept off the bat. We need to ask for an inch and  turn it into a foot without setting off panic alarms. Second, it is a  good idea to hone your remote-working abilities—rehearse a bit- before shooting for the big time, as it decreases the likelihood of  crises and screwups that will get remote rights revoked.  Step 5: Expand  Remote Time  Sherwood ensures that his days outside of the office are his most  productive to date, even minimally dropping in-office production to  heighten the contrast. He sets a meeting to discuss the results with  his boss on August 15 and prepares a bullet-point page detailing in- creased results and items completed compared to in-off ice time. He  suggests upping the ante to four days per week remote for a two- week trial, fully prepared to concede to three days if need be.  58. Do not digress from your goal. Once you've addressed an objection or concern, go  for the close.  ======================================== [Página 226] ======================================== 214 STEP  IV: L IS FOR LIBERATION  Sherwood: It really turned out even better than I expected. If you  look at the numbers, it makes a lot of business sense, and I'm  enjoying work a lot more now. So, here we are. I'd like to sug- gest, if you think it makes sense, that I try four days a week for  another two-week trial. I was thinking that coming in Friday59  would make sense to prepare for the coming week, but we  could do whichever day you prefer.  Bill:  Sherwood, I'm really not sure we can do that.  Sherwood: What's your main concern?60  Bill: It seems like you're on your way out. I mean, are you going to  quit on us? Second, what if everyone wants to do the same?   Sherwood: Fair enough. Good points.61 First, to be honest. I was  close to quitting before, with all the interruptions and commute  and whatnot, but I'm actually feeling great now with the change  in routine.62 I'm doing more and feel relaxed for a change.  Second, no one should be allowed to work remotely unless they  can show increased productivity, and I'm the perfect  experiment. If they can show it, however, why not let them do  it on a trial basis? It lowers costs for the office, increases  productivity, and makes employees happier. So. what do you  say? Can I test it out for two weeks and come in Fridays to take  care of the office stuff? I'll still document everything, and you,  of course, have the right to change your mind at any point.  59. Friday is the best day to be in the office. People are relaxed and tend to leave  early.  60. Do not accept a vague refusal. Pinpointing the main concern in detail enables you  to overcome it.  61. Don't jump to the defensive after an objection. Acknowledge the validity of a  boss's concerns to prevent an ego-driven battle of wills.  62. Note this indirect threat dressed as a confession. It will make the boss think  twice about refusing but prevents the win-lose outcome of an ultimatum.  ======================================== [Página 227] ======================================== Disappea ring Act 215  Bill:  Man, you are an insistent one. OK, we'll give it a shot, but don't  go blabbing about it. Sherwood: Of course. Thanks, Bill. I  appreciate  the trust. Talk to  you soon.   Sherwood continues to be productive at home and maintains his  lower in-office performance. He reviews the results with his boss  after two weeks and continues with four remote days per week for an  additional two weeks until Tuesday, September 19, when he requests  a full-time remote trial of two weeks while he is visiting relatives out  of state.63 Sherwood's team  is in the middle of a project that requires  his expertise, and he is prepared to quit if his boss refuses. He  realizes that, just as you want to negotiate ad pricing close to  deadlines, getting what you want often depends more on when you  ask for it than how you ask for it. Though he would prefer not to quit,  his income from shirts is more than enough to fund his dream-lines  of Oktoberfest and beyond.  His boss acquiesces and Sherwood doesn't have to use his threat  of quitting. He goes home that evening and buys a $524  round-trip  ticket, less than one week's shirt sales, to Munich for Oktoberfest.  Now he can implement all the time-savers possible and hack out  the inessentials. Somewhere between drinking wheat beer and  dancing in lederhosen, Sherwood will get his work done in fine form,  leaving his company better off than prior to 80/20 and leaving  himself all the time in the world.  But hold on a second... What if your boss still refuses? Hmm...  Then they force your hand. If upper management won't see the light,  you'll just have to use the next chapter to fire their asses.  63. This removes the boss's ability to call you to the office. This is critical for making  the first jump overseas.  ======================================== [Página 228] ======================================== 216 STEP  IV: L IS FOR LIBERATION  An Alternative: The Hourglass Approach  t can be effective to take a longer period of absence up front in what some NR  have termed the "hourglass" approach, so named because you use a long proof- of-concept up front to get a short remote agreement and then negotiate back up  to full-time out of the office. Here's what it looks like.  1. Use a preplanned project or emergency (family issue, personal issue,  relocation, home repairs, whatever) that requires you to take one or two  weeks out of the office.  2. Say that you recognize you can't just stop working and that you would  prefer to work instead of taking vacation days.  3. Propose how you can work remotely and offer, if necessary, to take a  pay cut for that period (and that period only) if performance isn't up to  par upon returning.  4. Allow the boss to collaborate on how to do it so that he or she is  invested in the process.  5. Make the two weeks "off" the most productive period you've ever had at  work.  6. Show your boss the quantifiable results upon returning, and tell him or  her that—without all the distractions, commute, etc.—you can get twice  as much done. Suggest two or three days at home per week as a trial  for two weeks.  7. Make those remote days ultraproductive.  8. Suggest only one or two days in the office per week.  9. Make those days the least productive of the week.  10. Sugge st complete mobility—the boss will go for it.  -Q&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS  Recently, I was asked if I was going to fire an employee who made a  mistake that cost the company $600 ,000.

That is why most men dread it.  —GEORG E BERN ARD SHAW   hile entrepreneurs have the most trouble with Automation,  since they fear giving up control, employees get stuck on  Liberation because they fear taking control. Resolve to grab the  reins—the rest of your life depends on it.  The following questions and actions will help you to replace  presence-based work with performance-based freedom.  1. If you had a heart attack, and assuming your boss were sym  pathetic, how could you work remotely for four weeks?  If you hit a brick wall with a task that doesn't seem remote- compatible or if you predict resistance from your boss, ask the  following:  •-What are you accomplishing with this task—what is the  purpose?  •-If you had to find other ways to accomplish the same—if your  life depended on it—ho w would you do it? Remote confer- encing? Video conferencing? GoToMeeting, GoToMyPC, or  related services?  •-Why would your boss resist remote work? What is the imme- diate negative effect it would have on the company and what  could you do to prevent or minimize it?  2. Put yourself in your boss's shoes. Based on your work history,  would you trust yourself to work outside of the office? If you  wouldn't, reread Elimination to improve production and consider  the hourglass option.  3. Practice environment-free productivity.  Attempt to work for two to three hours in a cafe for two Satur- days prior to proposing a remote trial. If you exercise in a gym,  attem pt to exercise for those two weeks at home or otherwise W  ======================================== [Página 230] ======================================== 218 STEP IV: L IS FOR LIBERATION  outside of the gym environment. The purpose here is to separate  your activities from a single environment and ensure that you  have the discipline to work solo.  4. Quantify current productivity.  If you have applied the 80/20 Principle, set the rules of interrupt- ing interruption, and completed related groundwork, your per- formance should be at an all-time high in quantifiable terms,  whether customers served, revenue generated, pages produced,  speed of accounts receivable, or otherwise. Document this.  5. Create an opportunity to demonstrate remote work produc  tivity before asking for it as a policy.  This is to test your ability to work outside of an office environ- ment and rack up some proof that you can kick ass without  constant supervision.  6. Practice the art of getting past "no" before proposing.  Go to farmers' markets to negotiate prices, ask for free first-class  upgrades, ask for compensation if you encounter poor service in  restaurants, and otherwise ask for the world and practice using the  following magic questions when people refuse to give it to you.  "What would I need to do to [desired outcome]?" "Under what  circumstances would you [desired outcome]?" "Have you ever  made an exception?" "I'm sure you've made an exception  before, haven't you?" (If no for either of the last two, ask,  "Why not?" If yes, ask, "Why?")  7. Put your employer on remote training wheels—propose Mon  day or Friday at home.  Consider doing this, or the following step, during a period when  ======================================== [Página 231] ======================================== Disappearing Act 219  it would be too disruptive to fire you, even if you were marginally  less productive while remote.  If your employer refuses, it's time to get a new boss or become  an entrepreneur. The job will never give you the requisite time  freedom. If you decide to jump ship, consider letting them make  you walk the plank—quitting is often less appealing than tactfully  getting fired and using severance or unemployment to take a long  vacation.  8. Extend each successful trial period until you reach full-time or  your desired level of mobility.  Don't underestimate  how much your company needs you. Per- form well and ask for what you want. If you don't get it over time,  leave. It's too big a world to spend most of life in a cubicle.  ======================================== [Página 232] ======================================== Beyond Repair  -KILLING YOUR JOB  All courses of action are risky, so prudence is not in avoiding  danger (it's impossible), but calculating risk and acting  decisively.

Going into a project or job without defining when worth- while becomes wasteful is like going into a casino without a cap on  what you will gamble: dangerous and foolish.

You are just terrified  that you might end up worse off than you are now.  I'll tell you right now: If you're at this point, you won't be worse off.  Revisit fear-setting and cut the cord.  Like Pulling Off a Band-Aid: Its Easier and  Less Painful Than You Think  The average man is a conformist, accepting miseries and  disasters with the stoicism of a cow standing in the rain. — COLIN WILSON, British author of The Outsider; New  Existentialist  here are several principal phobias that keep people on sinking ships,  and there are simple rebuttals for all of them.  1. Quitting is permanent.  Far from it. Use the Q&A questions in this chapter and chapter 3 (Fear- setting) to examine how you could pick up your chosen career track or  start another company at a later point. I have never seen an example  where a change of direction wasn't somehow reversible.  2. I won't be able to pay the bills.  Sure you will. First of all, the objective will be to have a new job or  source of cash flow before quitting your current job. Problem solved.  If you jump ship or get fired, it isn't hard to eliminate most expenses  temporarily and live on savings for a brief period. From renting out your  home to refinancing or selling it, there are options. There are always  options.  It might be emotionally difficult, but you won't starve. Park your car  in the garage and cancel insurance for a few months. T  ======================================== [Página 236] ======================================== 224 STEP IV: L IS FOR LIBERATION  Carpool or take the bus until you find the next gig. Rack up some  more credit card debt and cook instead of eating out. Sell all the  crap that you spent hundreds or thousands on and never use.  Take a full inventory of your assets, cash reserves, debts, and  monthly expenses. How long could you survive with your current  resources or if you sold some assets?  Go through all expenses and ask yourself, If I had to eliminate  this because I needed an extra kidney, how would I do it? Don't  be melodramat ic when there is no need—few things are fatal,  particularly for smart people. If you've made it this far in life, los- ing or dropping a job will often be little more than a few weeks of  vacation (unless you want more) prior to something better.  3. Health insurance and retirement accounts disappear if I quit.  Untrue.  I was scared of both when I was eliminated from TrueSAN. I  had visions of rotting teeth and working at Wal-Mart to survive.  Upon looking at the facts and exploring options, I realized that  I could have identical medical and dental coverage—the same  provider and network—fo r $300-500 per month. To transfer my  40i(k) to another company (I chose Fidelity Investments) was  even easier: It took less than 30 minutes via phone and cost  nothing.  Covering both of these bases takes less time than getting a  customer service rep on the phone to fix your electric bill.  4. It will ruin my resume.  I love creative nonfiction.  It is not at all difficult to sweep gaps under the rug and make  uncommon items the very things that get job interviews. How?  Do something interesting and make them jealous. If you quit and  then sit on your ass, I wouldn't hire you either.  On the other hand, if you have a one-to-two-year world cir-  ======================================== [Página 237] ======================================== Beyond Repair 225  cumnavigation on your resume or training with professional  soccer team s in Europe to your credit, two interesting things  happen upon returning to the working world. First, you will get  more interviews because you will stand out. Second, interviewers  bored in their own jobs will spend the entire meet ing asking how  you did it!  If there is any question of why you took a break or left your  previous job, there is one answer that cannot be countered: "I had  a once-in-a-lifetime chance to do [exotic and envy-producing ex- perience] and couldn't turn it down. I figured that, with [20-40]  years of work to go, what's the rush?"  The Chee secake Factor  Would you like me to give you a formula for success? It's quite  simple, really. Double your rate of failure. —THOMAS J. WATSON,  founder of IBM  SUMMER 1999  ven before I tasted it, I knew something wasn't quite right. After eight hours in  the refrigerator, this cheesecake still hadn't set at all. It swished in the gallon  bowl like a viscous soup, chunks  shifting and bobbing as I tilted it under close  inspection. Somewhere a mistake had been made. It could have been any  number of things:  Three 1 lb. sticks of Philly Cream Cheese  Eggs  Stevia  Unf lavored gelatin  Vanilla  Sour cream  In this case, it was probably a combination of things and the lack of a few  simple ingredients that generally make cheesecake a form of cake. E  ======================================== [Página 238] ======================================== 226 STEP  IV: L IS FOR LIBERATION  I was on a no-carbohydrate diet, and I had used this recipe before. It had  been so delicious that my roommates wanted their fair share and insisted on an  attempt at bulk production. Hence began the mathematical shenanigans and  problems.  Before Splenda® and other miracles of sugar imitation came on the scene,  the hard core used stevia, an herb 300 times sweeter than sugar. One drop was  like 300 packets of sugar. It was a delicate tool and I wasn't a delicate cook. I had  once made a small handful of cookies using baking soda instead of baking  powder, and that was bad enough to drive my roommates to puke on the lawn.  This new masterpiece made the cookies look like fine dining: It tasted like liquid  cream cheese mixed with cold water and about 600 packets of sugar.  I then did what any normal and rational person would do: I grabbed the  largest soup ladle with a sigh and sat down in front of the TV to face my  punishment. I had wasted an entire Sunday and a boatload of ingredients—it was  time to reap what I had sown.  One hour and 20 large spoonfuls later, I hadn't made a dent in the enormous  batch of soup, but I was down for the count. Not only could I not eat anything but  soup for two days, I couldn't bring myself to even look at cheesecake, previously  my favorite dessert, for more than four years.  Stupid? Of course. It's about as stupid as one can get. This is a ridiculous  and micro example of what people do on a larger scale with jobs all the time: self- imposed suffering that can be avoided. Sure, I learned a lesson and paid for the  mistake. The real question is— for what?  There are two types of mistakes: mistakes of ambition and mistakes of sloth.  The first is the result of a decision to act—to do something. This type of  mistake is made with incomplete information, as it's impossible to have all the  facts beforehand. This is to be encouraged. Fortune favors the bold.  The second is the result of a decision of sloth—to not do something— wherein we refuse to change a bad situation out of fear despite having all the  facts. This is how learning experiences become terminal punishments, bad  relationships become bad marriages, and poor job choices become lifelong  prison sentences.  ======================================== [Página 239] ======================================== Beyond Repair 227  "Yeah, but what if I'm in an industry where jumping around is looked  down upon? I've been here barely a year, and prospective employers  would think..."  Would they? Test assumptions before condemning yourself to more  misery. I've seen one determinant of sex appeal  to good employers:  performance. If you are a rock star when it comes to results, it doesn't  matter if you jump ship from a bad company after three weeks. On the  other hand, if tolerating a punishing work environment for years at a  time is a prerequisite for promotion in your field, could it be that you're in  a game not worth winnin g?  The consequences of bad decisions do not get better with age.

It's neither uncommon nor fatal. Here are a few  exercises to help you realize just how natural job changes are and how  simple the transition can be.  i.   First, a familiar reality check: Are you more likely to find what you want  in your current job or somewhere else?  2. If you were fired from your job today, what would you do to get things  under financial control?  3. Take a sick day and post your resume on the major job sites. Even if you  have no immediate plans to leave your job, post your resume on sites  such as www.monster.com and www.career builder.com, using a  pseudonym if you prefer.

Call headhunters if your level makes such a step appropriate, and  send a brief e-mail such as the one below to friends and nonwork  contacts.  Dear All,  I am considering making a career move and am  interested in all opportunities that might come to mind.  Nothing is too outrageous or out of left field. [If you know  what you want or don't want on some level, feel free to add,  "I am particularly interested in . . ." or "I would like to avoid .  . ."]  Please let me know if anything comes to mind!

Take a sneak peek at the future now and it will make both action  and being assertive easier.  4. If you run or own a company, imagine that you have just been  sued and must declare bankruptcy.

The transformation begins in a small Mexican village.  ======================================== [Página 243] ======================================== Mini-Retirements 231  Fables and Fortune Hunters  n American businessman took a vacation to a small coastal  Mexican village on doctor's orders. Unable to sleep after an  urgent phone call from the office the first morning, he walked out to  the pier to clear his head. A small boat with just one fisherman had  docked, and inside the boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The  American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish.  "How long did it take you to catch them?" the American asked.  "Only a little while," the Mexican replied in surprisingly good  English.  "Why don't you stay out longer and catch more fish?" the Ameri- can then asked.  "I have enough to support my family and give a few to friends,"  the Mexican said as he unloaded them into a basket.  "But... What do you do with the rest of your time?"  The Mexican looked up and smiled. "I sleep late, fish a little, play  with my children, take a siesta with my wife, Julia, and stroll into the  village each evening, where I sip wine and play guitar with my  amigos. I have a full and busy life, senor."  The American laughed and stood tall. "Sir, I'm a Harvard M.B.A.  and can help you. You should spend more time fishing, and with the  proceeds, buy a bigger boat. In no time, you could buy several boats  with the increased haul. Eventually, you would have a fleet of fishing  boats."  He continued, "Instead of selling your catch to a middleman, you  would sell directly to the consumers, eventually opening your own  cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution.  You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village, of course,  and move to Mexico City, then to Los Angeles, and eventually New  York City, where you could run your expanding enterprise with  proper management." A  ======================================== [Página 244] ======================================== 232 STEP IV: L IS FOR LIBERATION  The Mexican fisherman asked, "But, sefior, how long will all this  take?"  To which the American replied, "15-20 years. 25 tops."  "But what then, sefior?"  The American laughed and said, "That's the best part. When the  time is right, you would announce an IPO and sell your company  stock to the public and become very rich. You would make millions."  "Millions, senor? Then what?"  "Then you would retire and move to a small coastal fishing vil- lage, where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids,  take a siesta with your wife, and stroll to the village in the evenings  where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos ..."  I RECENTLY HAD lunch in San Francisco with a good friend and  former college roommate . He will soon graduate from a top business  school and return to investment banking. He hates coming home  from the office at midnight but explained to me that, if he works 80- hour weeks for nine years, he could become a managing director and  make a cool $3-10 million per year. Then he would be successful.  "Dude, what on earth would you do with $3-10 million per year?"  I asked.  His answer? "I would take a long trip to Thailand."  That just about sums up one of the biggest self-deceptions of our  modern age: extended world travel as the domain of the ultrarich.  I've also heard the following:  "I'll just work in the firm for 15 years. Then I'll be partner and I  can cut back on hours. Once I have a million in the bank, I'll put it in  something safe like bonds, take $80,000 a year in interest, and retire  to sail in the Caribbean."  "I'll only work in consulting until I'm 35, then retire and ride a  motorcycle across China."  If your dream, the pot of gold at the end of the career rainbow, is  ======================================== [Página 245] ======================================== Mini-Retirements 233  to live large in Thailand, sail around the Caribbean, or ride a motor- cycle across China, guess what? All of them can be done for less  than $3,00 0. I've done all three. Here are just two examples of how  far a little can go.64  $250  U.S. Five days on a private Smithsonian tropical  research island with three local fishermen who caught and  cooked all my food and also took me on tours of the best  hidden dive spots in Panama.   $150  U.S. Three days of chartering a private plane in  Mendoza wine country in Argentina and flying over the  most beautiful vineyards around the snowcapped Andes  with a personal guide.  Question: What did you spend your last $400 on? It's two or three  weekends of nonsense and throwaway forget-the-workweek behavior  in most U.S. cities. $400 is nothing for a full eight days of life- changing experiences. But eight days isn't what I'm recomme nding at  all. Those were just interludes in a much larger production. I'm  proposing much, much more.  The Birth of Mini-Retirements and  the Death of Vacations  There is more to life than increasing its speed.  —MOHANDAS GANDHI  n February of 2004,1 was miserable and overworked. My travel  fantasy began as a plan to visit Costa Rica in March 2004 for four  weeks of Spanish and relaxation. I needed a recharge  64. The dollar figures in this chapter are all from a period immediately following  President Bush's reelection in 2004 , which correlated to the worst dollar exchange  rates of the last 20 years. I  ======================================== [Página 246] ======================================== 234 STEP IV: L IS FOR LIBERATION  and four weeks seeme d "reasonable" by whatever cockamamie  benchmark you can use for such a thing.  A friend familiar with Central America dutifully pointed out that  it would never work, as Costa Rica was about to enter its rainy  season. Torrential downpours weren't the uplifting jolt I needed, so I  shifted my focus to four weeks in Spain. It's a long trip over the  Atlantic, though, and Spain was close to other countries I'd always  wanted to visit. I lost "reasonable" somewhere shortly thereafter and  decided that I deserved a full three months to explore my roots in  Scandinavia after four weeks in Spain.  If there were any real-time bombs or pending disasters, they  would certainly crop up in the first four weeks, so there really wasn't  any additional risk in extending my trip to three months. Three months  would be great.  Those three months turned into 15, and I started to ask myself,  "Why not take the usual 20-30-year retirement and redistribute it  throughout life instead of saving it all for the end?"  The Alternative to Binge Traveling  Thanks to the Interstate Highway System, it is now possible  to travel from coast to coast without seeing anything. — CHARLES KURALT, CBS news reporter  f you are accustomed to working 50 weeks per year, the tendency,  even after creating the mobility to take extended trips, will be to go  nuts and see 10 countries in 14 days and end up a wreck. It's like  taking a starving dog to an all-you-can-eat buffet. It will eat itself to  death.  I did this three months into my 15-month vision quest, visiting  seven countries and going through at least 20 check-ins and check- outs with a friend who had negotiated three weeks off. The trip was  an adrenaline-packed blast but like watching life on fast-forward. It I  ======================================== [Página 247] ======================================== Mini-Retirements 235  was hard for us to remem ber what had happened in which countries  (except Amsterdam65), we were both sick most of the time, and we  were upset to have to leave some places simply because our pre- purchased flights made it so.  I recomme nd doing the exact opposite.  The alternative to binge travel—the mini-retirement—entails  relocating to one place for one to six months before going home or  moving to another locale. It is the anti-vacation in the most positive  sense. Though it can be relaxing, the mini-retirement is not an escape  from your life but a reexamination of it—the creation of a blank  slate. Following elimination and automation, what would you be  escaping from? Rather than seeking to see the world through photo  ops between foreign-but-familiar hotels, we aim to experience it at a  speed that lets it change us.  This is also different from a sabbatical. Sabbaticals are often  viewed much like retirement: as a one-time event. Savor it now while  you can. The mini-retirement is defined as recurring—it is a lifestyle.  I currently take three or four mini-retirements per year and know  dozens who do the same.

This takes time. The effect is not cumulative, and no number of  two-week (also called "too weak"66) sightseeing trips can replace one  good walkabout.67  In the experience of those I've interviewed, it takes two to three  months just to unplug from obsolete routines and become aware of  just how much we distract ourselves with constant motion. Can you  have a two-hour dinner with Spanish friends without getting  anxious? Can you get accustomed to a small town where all busi- nesses take a siesta for two hours in the afternoon  and then close at  4:00 P.M.? If not, you need to ask, Why?  Learn to slow down. Get lost intentionally. Observe how you  judge both yourself and those around you. Chances are that it's been  a while. Take at least two months to disincorporate old habits and  rediscover yourself without the reminder of a looming return flight.  The Financial Realities: It Just Gets Better  he economic argument for mini-retirements is the icing on the  cake. Four days in a decent hotel or a week for two at a nice  hostel costs the same as a month in a nice posh apartment.

I've been  there, so this isn't a holier-than-thou sermon. I know too well  that it's easier to live with ourselves if we cite an external reason for  inaction.  I've since met paraplegics and the deaf, senior citizens and single  mothers, home owners and the poor, all of whom have sought and  found excellent life-changing reasons for extended travel instead of  dwelling on the million small reasons against it.  Most of the concerns above are addressed in the Q&A, but one in  particular requires a bit of preemptive nerve calming.

The prime fear of all parents prior to their first international trip is  somehow losing a child in the shuffle.  The good news is that if you are comfortable taking your kids to  New York, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., or London, you will  have even less to worry about in the starting cities I recomme nd in  the Q&A. There are fewer guns and violent crimes in all of them  compared to most large U.S. cities. The likelihood  of problems is  decreased further when travel is less airport and hotel-hopping among  strangers and more relocation to a second home: a mini-retirement.  But still, what if?  Jen Errico, a single mother who took her two children on a five- month world tour, had a more acute fear than most, one that often  woke her at 2:00 A.M. in a cold sweat: What if something happens  tome?  She wanted to prime her kids for worst-case scenario but didn't  want to scare them to death, so—like all good mothers—she made it  a game: Who can best mem orize the itineraries, hotel addresses, and  Mom's phone number? She had emergency contacts in each country  whose numbers were loaded into the speed dial of her cell phone,  which had global roaming. In the end, nothing happened. Now she's  planning to move to a ski chalet in Europe and send her kids to  school in multilingual France. Success begets success.  She was most afraid in Singapore, and in retrospect, it was where  she had the least reason to be worried (she took her kids to South  Africa, among other places). She was scared because it was the first  stop and she was unaccustomed to traveling with her kids. It was  perception, not reality.  Robin Malinsky-Rumme ll, who spent a year traveling through  South America with her husband and seven-year-old son, was  warned by friends and family not to visit Argentina after their de- valuation riots in 2001. She did her homework, decided that the fear  ======================================== [Página 253] ======================================== Mini-Retirements 241  was unfounded, and proceeded to have the time of her life in Pata- gonia. When she told locals that she was originally from New York,  their eyes widened and jaws dropped: "I saw those buildings blow up  on TV! I would never go to such a dangerous place!" Don't assume  that places abroad are more dangerous than your hometown. Most  aren't.  Robin is convinced, as I am, that people use children as an excuse  to stay in their comfort zones. It's an easy excuse not to do something  adventurous. How to overcome the fear? Robin recommends two  things:  i. Before embarking on a long international trip with your chil- dren for the first time, take a trial run for a few weeks.  2. For each stop, arrange a week of language classes that begin  upon arrival and take advantage of transportation from the  airport if available. The school staff will often handle apart- ment rentals for you, and you will be able to make friends and  learn the area before setting off on  your own.  But what if your concern isn't so much losing your children but  losing your mind because of your children?  Several families interviewed for this book recomme nded the  oldest persuasive tool known to man: bribery. Each child is given  some amount of virtual cash, 25-50 cents, for each hour of good be- havior. The same amount is subtracted from their accounts for  breaking the rules. All purchases for fun—whether souvenirs, ice  cream, or otherwise—come out of their own individual accounts. No  balance, no goodies. This often requires more self-control on the part  of the parents than the children.  ======================================== [Página 254] ======================================== 242 STEP  IV: L IS FOR LIBERATION  How to Get Airfare at 50-80% Off  his is not a book on budg et travel. Most of the cost-cutting recommendations  found in such guides are designed with the binge traveler in mind. For someone  embarking on a mini-retirement, an extra $150  for hassle-free airfare amortized  over two months is a better deal than 20 hours of manipulating frequent-flier  points on an unknown airline or chasing questionable deals.  Following two weeks of research, I once bought a one-way standby  ticket to  Europe for $120 . I arrived at JFK brimming with enthusiasm and confidence— look at all these schmucks paying retail!—and 90% of the "participating" airlines  refused my ticket. Those that didn't were booked for weeks solid. I ended up  staying in a hotel for two nights for a $300  tab, filing a complaint with AMEX, and  eventually calling 1-800-FLY-EUROPE from the JFK terminal in frustration. I  bought a round-trip ticket to London on Virgin Atlantic for $300  and left an hour  later. The same ticket cost more than $700  a week earlier.  After 25 countries, I've found a few simple strategies that get you 90% of the  possible savings without wasting time or producing migraines.  1. Use credit cards with reward points for large muse-related  advertising and manufacturing expenses.  I am not spending more money to get pennies on the dollar—these  costs are inevitable, so I capitalize on them. This alone gets me a free  round-trip international ticket each three months.  2. Purchase tickets far in advance (three months or more) or last  minute, and aim for both departure and return between Tues  day and Thursday.  Long-term travel planning turns me off and can be expensive if plans  change, so I opt for purchasing all tickets in the last four or five days  prior to target departure. The value of empty seats is $0 as soon as the  flight takes off, so true last-minute seats are cheap. T  ======================================== [Página 255] ======================================== Mini-Retirements 243  Use Orbitz (www .orbitz.com) first. Fix the departure and return dates  between Tuesday and Thursday. Then look at prices for alternative  departure dates each of three days into the past and each of three days into  the future. Using the cheapest departure date, do the same with the return  dates to find the cheapest combination. Check this price against the fares  on the website of the airline itself. Then begin bidding on www.priceline.com  at 50% of the better of the two, working up in $50 increments until you get a  better price or realize it's not possible. 3. Consider buying one ticket to an  international hub and then an ongoing ticket with a cheap local airline.  If going to Europe, I generally get three tickets. One free Southwest  ticket (from transferring AMEX points) from CA to JFK, the cheapest  ticket to Heathrow in London, and then an ubercheap ticket on either  Ryanair or EasyJet to my final destination. I have paid as little as $10 to  go from London to Berlin or London to Spain. That is not a typo. Local  airlines will often offer seats on flights for just the cost of taxes and  gasoline. To Central or South American destinations, I'll often look at  local flights from Panama or international flights from Miami.  When More Is Less: Cutting the Clutter  Human beings have the capacity to learn to want almost any  conceivable material object. Given, then, the emergence of a  modern industrial culture capable of producing almost  anything, the time is ripe for opening the storehouse of  infinite need! ... It is the modern Pandora's box, and its  plagues are loose upon the world.    —TULES HENRY  To be free, to be happy and fruitful, can only be attained  through sacrifice of many common but overestimated  things. —ROBERT  HENRI  ======================================== [Página 256] ======================================== 244 STEP IV: L IS FOR LIBERATION   know the son of one deca-millionaire, a personal friend of Bill  Gates, who now manages private investments and ranches. He has  accumulated an assortment of beautiful homes over the last decade,  each with full-time cooks, servants, cleaners, and support staff. How  does he feel about having a home in each time zone? It's a pain in the  ass! He feels like he's working for his staff, who spend more time in  his homes than he does.  Extended travel is the perfect excuse to reverse the damage of  years of consuming as much as you can afford. It's time to get rid of  clutter disguised as necessities before you drag a five-piece Sam- sonite set around the world. That is hell on earth.  I'm not going to tell you to walk around in a robe and sandals  scowling at people who have televisions. I hate that kashi-crunching  holier-than-thou stuff. Turning you into a possession-less scribe is  not my intention. Let's face it, though: There are tons of things in  your home and life that you don't use, need, or even particularly  want. They just came  into your life as impulsive flotsam and jetsam  and never found a good exit. Whether you're aware of it or not, this  clutter creates indecision and distractions, consuming attention and  making unfettered happiness a real chore. It is impossible to realize  how distracting all the crap is—whether porcelain dolls, sports cars,  or ragged T-shirts—until you get rid of it.  Prior to my 15-month trip, I was stressed about how to fit all of  my belongings into a 14 x 10-foot rental storage space. Then I  realized a few things: I would never reread the business magazines  I'd saved, I wore the same five shirts and four pairs of pants 90% of  the time, it was about time for new furniture, and I never used the  outdoor grill or lawn furniture.  Even getting rid of things I never used proved to be like a capital- ist short-circuit. It was hard to toss things I had once thought were  valuable enough to spend money on. The first ten minutes of sorting  through clothing was like choosing which child of mine should live  or die. I hadn't exercised my throwing-out muscles in some I  ======================================== [Página 257] ======================================== Mini-Retirements 245  time. It was a struggle to put nice Christmas clothing I'd never worn  into the "go" pile and just as hard to separate myself from worn and  ragged clothing I had for sentimental reasons. Once I'd passed  through the first few tough decisions, though, the momentum had  been built and it was a breeze. I donated all of the seldom-worn  clothing to Goodwill. The furniture took less than 10 hours to offload  using Craigslist, and though I was paid less than 50% of the retail  prices for some and nothing for others, who cared? I'd used and  abused them for five years and would get a new set when I landed  back in the United States. I gave the grill and lawn furniture to my  friend, who lit up like a kid at Christmas. I had made his month. It  felt wonderful and I had an extra $300  in pocket change to cover at  least a few weeks of rent abroad.  I created 40% more space in my apartment and hadn't even  grazed the surface. It wasn't the extra physical space that I felt most.  It was the extra mental space. It was as if I had 20 mental applica- tions running simultaneously before, and now I had just one or two.  My thinking was clearer and I was much, much happier.  I asked every vagabond interviewee in this book what their one  recomme ndation would be for first-time extended travelers. The  answer was unanimous: Take less with you.  The overpacking impulse is hard to resist. The solution is to set  what I call a "settling fund." Rather than pack for all contingencies, I  bring the absolute minimum and allocate $100-300 for purchasing  things after I arrive and as I travel. I no longer take toiletries or more  than a week's worth of clothing. It's a blast. Finding shaving cream or  a dress shirt overseas can produce an adventure in and of itself.  Pack as if you were coming back in one week. Here are the bare  essentials, listed in order of importance:  1. One week of clothing appropriate to the season, including one  semiformal shirt and pair of pants or skirt for customs. Think  T-shirts, one pair of shorts, and a multipurpose pair of jeans.  ======================================== [Página 258] ======================================== 246 STEP  IV: L IS FOR LIBERATION  2. Backup photocopies or scanned copies of all important docu- ments: health insurance, passport/visa, credit cards, debit  cards, etc.  3. Debit cards, credit cards, and $200  worth of small bills in  local currency (traveler's checks are not accepted in most  places and are a hassle)  4. Small cable bike lock for securing luggage while in transit or  in hostels; a small padlock for lockers if needed  5. Electronic dictionaries for target languages (book versions are  too slow to be of use in conversation) and small gramma r  guides or texts  6. One broad-strokes travel guide  That's it.

The Bora-Bora Dealmaker  "BAFFIN ISLAND , NUNAV Ul"  osh Steinitz69 stood at the edge of the world and stared in amazement. He dug  his boots into the six feet of sea ice and the unicorns danced.  Ten narwhals—rare cousins of the beluga—came to the surface and pointed  their six-foot-plus spiral tusks toward the heavens. The pod of 3,000-pound  whales then fell into the depths once again. The narwhals are deep divers—more  than 3,000 feet in some cases— so Josh had at least 20 minutes until their  reappearance.  It seemed appropriate that he was with the narwhals. Their name came from  Old Norse and referred to their mottled white and blue skin.  69. Founder of www .nileproject.com. J  ======================================== [Página 259] ======================================== Mini-Retirements 247  Nahva lr—corpse man.  He smiled as he had done often in the last few years. Josh himself was a  dead man walking.  One year after graduating from college, Josh found out that he had oral  squamous carcinoma—cancer. He had plans to be a management consultant.  He had plans to be lots of things. Suddenly none of it mattered. Less than half of  those who suffered from this particular type of cancer survived.70 The reaper  didn't discriminate and came without warning.  It became clear that the biggest risk in life wasn't making mistakes but regret:  missing out on things. He could never go back and recapture years spent doing  something he disliked.  Two years later and cancer-free, Josh set off on an indefinite global  walkabout, covering expenses as a freelance writer. He later became the  cofounder of a website that provides customized itineraries to would-be  vagabonds. His executive status didn't lessen his mobile addiction. He was as  comfortable cutting deals from the over-water bungalows of Bora-Bora as he was  in the log cabins of the Swiss Alps.  He once took a call from a client while at Camp Muir on Mt. Rainier. The  client needed to confirm some sales numbers and asked Josh about all the wind  in the background. Josh's answer: "I'm standing at 10,000 feet on a glacier and  this afternoon the wind is whipping us down the mountain." The client said he'd  let Josh get back to what he was doing.  Another client called Josh while he was leaving a Balinese temple and heard  the gongs in the background. The client asked Josh if he was in church. Josh  wasn't quite sure what to say. All that came out was, "Yes?"  Back among the narwhals, Josh had a few minutes before heading to base  camp to avoid polar bears. Twenty-four-hour daylight meant that he had much to  share with his friends back in the land of cubicles. He sat down on the ice and  produced his satellite phone and laptop from a waterproof bag. He began his e- mail in the usual way:  "I know you're all sick of seeing me have so much fun, but guess where I  am?"  70. http://www .usc.edu/hsc/dental/opfs/SC/indexSC.html.  ======================================== [Página 260] ======================================== 248 STEP IV: L IS FOR LIBERATION  -Q&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS  It is fatal to know too much at the outcome: boredom  comes as quickly to the traveler who knows his route as to  the novelist who is overcertain of his plot. —PAUL  THEROUX, To the Ends of the Earth  f this is your first time considering a commitment to the mobile  lifestyle and long-term adventuring, I envy you! Making the jump  and entering the new worlds that await is like upgrading your role in  life from passenger to pilot.  The bulk of this Q&A will focus on the precise steps that you  should take—and the countdown timeline you can use—when pre- paring for your first mini-retirement. Most steps can be eliminated or  condensed once you get one trip under your belt. Some of the steps  are one-time events, after which subsequent mini-retirements will  require a maximum of two to three weeks of preparation. It now  takes me three afternoon s.  Grab a pencil and paper—this will be fun.  i.   Take an asset and cash-flow snapshot.  Set two sheets of paper on a table. Use one to record all assets  and corresponding values, including bank accounts, retirement  accounts, stocks, bonds, home, and so forth. On the second, draw  a line down the middle and write down all incoming cash flow  (salary, muse income, investment income, etc.) and outgoing  expenses (mortgage, rent, car payments, etc.). What can you  eliminate that is either seldom used or that creates stress or dis- traction without adding a lot of value?  2.  Fear-set a one-year mini-retirement in a dream location in Europe.  Use the questions from chapter 3 to evaluate your worst-case- scenario fears and evaluate the real potential consequences. Ex- I  ======================================== [Página 261] ======================================== Mini-Retirements 2 49  cept in rare cases, most will be avoidable and the rest will be  reversible.  3.   Choose a location for your actual mini-retirement. Where to  start?  This is the big question. There are two options that I advocate:   a. Choose a starting point and then wander until you find  your second home. This is what I did with a one-way ticket  to London , vagabonding throughout Europe until I fell in  love with Berlin, where I remained for three months.  b. Scout a region and then settle in your favorite spot. This is  what I did with a tour of Central and South America,  where I spent one to four weeks in each of several cities,  after which I returned to my favorite—Bu enos Aires—for  six months.  It is possible to take a mini-retirement in your own country, but  the transformative effect is hampered if you are surrounded by  people who carry the same socially reinforced baggage.  I recomme nd choosing an overseas location that will seem  foreign but that isn't dangerous. I box, race motorcycles, and do  all sorts of macho things, but I draw the line atfavelas,71 civilians  with machine guns, pedestrians with machetes, and social strife.  Cheap is good, but bullet holes are bad. Check the U.S. Depart- ment of State for travel warnings before booking tickets (http://  travel.state.gov).  Here are just a few of my favorite starting points. Feel free to  choose other locations. The most lifestyle for the dollar is under- lined: Argentina (Buenos Aires, Cordoba), China (Shanghai,  Hong Kong, Taipei), Japan (Tokyo, Osaka), England (London),  71. Brazilian shantytowns. See the movie City of God (Cidade  de Deus)\o get a taste  of how fun these are.  ======================================== [Página 262] ======================================== 250 STEP IV: L IS FOR LIBERATION  Ireland (Galway), Thailand (Bangkok, Chiang Mai), Germany  (Berlin. Munich), Norway (Oslo), Australia (Sydney), New Zea- land (Queenstown), Italy (Rome, Milan, Florence), Spain (Ma- drid, Valencia, Sevilla), and Holland (Amsterdam). In all of these  places, it is possible to live well while spending little. I spend less  in Tokyo than in California because I know it well. Hip, recently  gentrified artist areas, not unlike the Brooklyn of 10 years ago,  can be found in almost all cities. The one place I can't seem to  find a decent lunch for less than $20 U.S.? London.  Here are a few exotic places I don't recomme nd for vaga- bonding virgins: all countries in Africa, the Middle East, or Cen- tral and South America (excepting Costa Rica and Argentina).  Mexico City and Mexican border areas are also a bit too kidnap- happy to make it onto my favorites list.  4. Prepare for your trip. Here's the countdown.  "Three months out—Eliminate  Get used to minimalism before the departure. Here are the ques- tions to ask and act upon, even if you never plan to leave:  What is the 20% of my belongings that I use 80% of the time?  Eliminate the other 80% in clothing, magazines, books,  and all else. Be ruthless—you can always repurchase  things you can't live without.  Which belongings create stress in my life? This could relate to  maintenance costs (money and energy), insurance, monthly  expenses, time consumption, or simple distraction.  Eliminate, eliminate, eliminate. If you sell even a few  expensive items, it could finance a good portion of your  mini-retirement. Don't rule out the car and home. It's  always possible to purchase either upon your return, often  losing no money in the process.  ======================================== [Página 263] ======================================== Mini-Retirements 251  Check current health insurance coverage for extended over- seas travel. Get the wheels in motion to rent or sell your home—  renting out is most recommended by serial vagabonds—or end  your apartment lease and move all belongings into storage.  In all cases where doub ts crop up, ask yourself, "If I had a gun  to my head and had to do it, how would I do it?" It's not as hard as  you think.  "-Two months out—Automate  After eliminating the excess, contact companies (including sup- pliers) that bill you regularly and set up autopayment with credit  cards that have reward points. Telling them that you will be travel- ing the world for a year often persuades them to accept credit cards  rather than chase you around the planet like Carmen Sandiego.  For the credit card companies themselves and others that  refuse, arrange automatic debit from your checking account. Set  up online banking and bill payment. Set up all companies that  won't take credit cards or automatic  debit as online payees. Set  these scheduled checks for $15-20 more than expected when  dealing with utilities and other variable expenses. This will cover  miscellaneous fees, prevent time-consuming billing problems,  and accrue as a credit. Cancel paper bank and credit card state- ment delivery. Get bank-issued credit cards for all checking  accounts—generally one for business and one for personal— and  set the cash advances to $0 to minimize abuse potential. Leave  these cards at home, as they are just for emergency overdraft  protection.  Give a trusted member of your family and/or your accountant  power of attorney,72 which gives that person authority to  72. This is a serious step and should not be taken with those you do not trust. In this  case, it helps because your accountant can then sign tax documents or checks in your  name instead of consuming hours and days of your time with faxes, scanners, and  expensive international FedEx'ing of documents.  ======================================== [Página 264] ======================================== 252 STEP IV: L IS FOR LIBERATION  sign documents (tax filings and checks, for example) in your  name. Nothing screws up foreign fun faster than having to sign  original documents when faxes are unacceptable.  ■-One month out—  Speak to the manager of your local post office and have all mail  forwarded to a friend, family member, or personal assistant, who  will be paid $100 -200 per month to e-mail you brief descriptions  of all nonjunk mail each Monday.  Get all required and recomme nded immunizations and vac- cinations for your target region. Check the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention (www.cdc.gov/travel/). Note that proof of  immunizations is sometimes required to pass through foreign  customs.  Set up a trial account with GoToMyPC or similar remote- access software and take a dry run to ensure that there are no  technological glitches.73  If resellers (or distributors) still send you checks—the fulfill- ment house should handle customer checks at this point—do one  of three things: give the resellers direct bank deposit information  (ideal), have the fulfillment house handle these checks (second  choice), or have the resellers pay via PayPal or mail checks to one  of the people you are trusting with power of attorney (far third).  In the last case, give the person with power of attorney deposit  slips so he or she can sign or stamp and mail in the checks. It is  convenient to become a member of a large bank (Bank of  America, Wells Fargo, Washington Mutual, Citibank, etc.) with  branches near the person assisting you so that they can drop off  the deposits while running other errands. No need to  73. This would be used if you leave your computer at home or in someone else's  home while traveling. This step can be skipped if you bring your computer, but that is  like a recovering heroin addict bringing a bag of opium to rehab. Don't tempt yourself  to kill time instead of rediscovering it.  ======================================== [Página 265] ======================================== Mini-Retirements 253  move all accounts to this bank if you don't want to; just open a  single new account that is used solely for these deposits.  ■-Two weeks out—  Scan all identification, health insurance, and credit/debit cards  into a computer from which you can print multiple copies, several  to be left with family members and several to be taken with you  in separate bags. E-mail the scanned file to yourself so that you  can access it while abroad if you lose the paper copies.  If you are an entrepreneur, downgrade your cell phone to the  cheapest plan and set up a voicema il greeting that states, "I am  currently overseas on business. Please do not leave a voicema il,  as I will not be checking it while gone. Please send me an e-mail  at___@__.com if the matte r is important. Thank you for your  understanding." Then set up e-mail autoresponders that indicate  responses could take up to seven days (or whatever you decide  for frequency) due to international business travel.  If you are an employee, consider getting a quad-band or GSM- compatible cell phone so that the boss can contact you. Get a  BlackBerry only if your boss will be checking to see if you are  working via e-mail. Be sure to disable the dead giveaway "Sent  from a BlackBerry" signature on outgoing e-mail! Other options  include using a Skypeln account that forwards to your foreign cell  phone (my preference) or a Vonage IP box that allows you to  receive landline calls anywhere in the world via a phone number  that begins with your home area code.  Find an apartment for your ultimate  mini-retirement desti- nation or reserve a hostel or hotel at your starting point for three  to four days. Reserving an apartment before you arrive is riskier  and will be much more expensive than using the latter three to  four days to find an apartment. I recomme nd hostels for the  starting point if possible—not for cost considerations  ======================================== [Página 266] ======================================== 254 STEP IV: L IS FOR LIBERATION  but because the staff and fellow travelers are more knowledge- able and helpful with relocations.  Get foreign medical evacuation insurance if needed for peace  of mind. This tends to be redundant if you are in a first-world  country and can buy local insurance to augment your own, which  I do, and it is useless if you are a io-hour flight from civilization.  I had evacuation insurance in Panama, as it's a 2-hour flight from  Miami, but I didn't bother elsewhere. Don't freak out about this;  it's just as true if you're in the middle of nowhere in the middle of  the United States.  •-One week out—  Decide on a schedule for routine batched tasks such as e-mail,  online banking, etc. to eliminate excuses for senseless pseudo- work procrasterbating. I suggest Monday mornings for checking  e-mail and online banking. The first and third Mondays of the  month can be used for checking credit cards and making other  online payments such as affiliates. These promises to yourself  will be the hardest to keep, so make a commitment now and  expect serious withdrawal cravings.  Save important documents—including the scan of your iden- tification, insurance, and credit/debit cards—to a small handheld  storage device that plugs into a computer USB port.  Move all things out of your home or apartment into storage,  pack a single small backpack and carry-on bag for the adventure,  and move in briefly with a family member or friend.  •-Two days out—  Put remaining automobiles into storage or a friend's garage. Put  fuel stabilizer in the gas tanks, disconnect the negative leads from  batteries to prevent drain, and put the vehicles on jack stands to  prevent tire and shock damage. Cancel all auto insurance except  for theft coverage.  ======================================== [Página 267] ======================================== Mini-Retirements 255  -Upon arrival (assuming you have not booked an apartment in  advance)—  First morning and afternoon  after check-in Take a hop-on-hop- off bus tour of the city followed by a bike tour of potential  apartment neighborhood s.  First late afternoon  or evening Purchase an unlocked74 cell  phone with a SIM card that can be recharged with simple  prepaid cards. E-mail apartment owners or brokers on  Craigslist.com and online versions of local newspapers for  viewings over the next two days.  Second and third days Find and book an apartment for one  month. Don't commit to more than one month until you've  slept there. I once prepaid two months only to find that the  busiest bus stop downtown was on the other side of my  bedroom wall.  Move-in day Get settled and purchase local health insurance.  Ask hostel owners and other locals what insurance they  use. Resolve not to buy souvenirs or other take-home items  until two weeks prior to departure.  One week later Eliminate all the extra crap you brought but  won't use often. Either give it to someone who needs it  more, mail it back to the United States, or throw it out.  74. "Unlocked" means that it is recharged with prepaid cards instead of being on a  monthly payment plan with a single carrier such as 02 or Vodafone. This also means  that the same phone can be used with carriers in other countries (assuming the  frequency is the same) with a simple switch of the SIM memory card for $10-30 U.S.  in most cases. Some U.S.-compatible quad-band phones can use SIM cards.  ======================================== [Página 268] ======================================== 256 STEP IV: L IS FOR LIBERATION  "►TOOLS AND TRICKS  Brainstorming Mini-Retirement Locations  ►Virtual Tourist (www .virtualtourist.com)  The single largest source of unbiased, user-generated travel content in the  world.

It was 10:33 A.M. now, the fifth time I'd checked the  time, and the twentieth time I'd asked myself, "What the &%$# am I going  to do today?"  The best answer I had come up with so far was: get a sandwich.  Thirty minutes earlier, I had woken up without an alarm clock for the  first time in four years, fresh off arriving from JFK the night before. I had  soooo  been looking forward to it: awakening to musical birdsong outside,  sitting up in bed with a smile, smelling the aroma of freshly brewed coffee,  and stretching out overhead like a cat in the shade of a Spanish villa.  Magnificent. It turned out more like this: bolt upright as if blasted with a  foghorn, grab clock, curse, jump out of bed in underwear to check e-mail,  remember that I was I  ======================================== [Página 277] ======================================== Filling the Void 265  forbidden to do so, curse again, look for my host and former class- mate , realize that he was off to work like the rest of the world, and  proceed to have a panic attack.  I spent the rest of the day in a haze, wandering from museum to  botanical garden to museum as if on rinse and repeat, avoiding In- ternet cafes with some vague sense of guilt. I needed a to-do list to  feel productive and so put down things like "eat dinner."  This was going to be a lot harder than I had thought.  Postpartum Depression: Its Normal  Man is so made that he can only find relaxation from one  kind of labor by taking up another.  —ANA TOLE FRANCE, author of The Crime ofSylvestre  Bonnard  I've Got More Money and Time Than I Ever Dreamed  Possible . . . Why Am I Depressed?  It's a good question with a good answer. Just be glad you're figuring  this out now and not at the end of life! The retired and ultrarich are  often unfulfilled and neurotic for the same reason: too much idle  time.  But wait a second ... Isn't more time what we're after? Isn't that  what this book is all about? No, not at all. Too much free time is no  more than fertilizer for self-doubt and assorted mental tail-chasing.  Subtracting the bad does not create the good. It leaves a vacuum.  Decreasing income-driven work isn't the end goal. Living more—  and becoming more—is.  In the beginning, the external fantasies will be enough, and there  is nothing wrong with this. I cannot overemphasize the importance of  this period. Go nuts and live your dreams. This is not superficial or  selfish. It is critical to stop repressing yourself and get out of the  postponement habit.  ======================================== [Página 278] ======================================== 266 STEP IV: L IS FOR LIBERATION  Let's suppose you decide to dip your toe in dreams like relocating  to the Caribbean for island-hopping or taking a safari in the  Serengeti. It will be wonderful and unforgettable, and you should do  it. There will come a time, however—be it three weeks or three years  later—when you won't be able to drink another pina colada or  photograph another damn red-assed baboon. Self-criticism and ex- istential panic attacks start around this time.  But This Is What I Always Wanted! How Can I Be Bored?! Don't freak  out and fuel the fire. This is normal among all high-performers who  downshift after working hard for a long time. The smarter and more  goal-oriented you are, the tougher these growing pains will be.  Learning to replace the perception of time famine with appreciation  of time abundance is like going from triple espressos to decaf.  But there's more! Retirees get depressed for a second reason, and  you will too: social isolation.  Offices are good for some things: free bad coffee and complain- ing thereof, gossip and commiserating, stupid video clips via e-mail  with even stupider comme nts, and meetings that accomplish nothing  but kill a few hours with a few laughs. The job itself might be a dead  end, but it's the web of human interactions—the social  environment—that keeps us there. Once liberated, this automatic  tribal unit disappears, which makes the voices in your head louder.  Don't be afraid of the existential or social challenges. Freedom is  like a new sport. In the beginning, the sheer newness of it is exciting  enough to keep things interesting at all times. Once you have learned  the basics, though, it becomes clear that to be even a half-decent  player requires some serious practice.  Don't fret. The greatest rewards are to come, and you're 10 feet  from the finish line.  ======================================== [Página 279] ======================================== Filling the Void 267  Frustrations and Doubts:  You're Not Alone  People say that what we are seeking is a meaning for life. I  don't think this is what we're really seeking. I think what we're  seeking is an experience of being alive. —JOSEPH  CAMPBELL, The Power of Myth  nce you eliminate the 9-5 and the rubber hits the road, it's not all  roses and white-sand bliss, though much of it can be. Without the  distraction of deadlines and co-workers, the big questions (such as  "What does it all mean?") become harder to fend off for a later time.  In a sea of infinite options, decisions also become harder—What the  hell should I do with my life? It's like senior year in college all over  again.  Like all innov ators ahead of the curve, you will have frightening  moments of doubt. Once past the kid-in-a-candy-store phase, the  comparative impulse will creep in. The rest of the world will con- tinue with its 9-5 grind, and you'll begin to question your decision to  step off the treadmill. Common doubts and self-flagellation include  the following:  1. Am I really doing this to be more free and lead a better life, or  am I just lazy?  2. Did I quit the rat race because it's bad, or just because I couldn't  hack it? Did I just cop out?  3. Is this as good as it gets? Perhaps I was better off when I was  following orders and ignorant of the possibilities. It was easier  at least.  4. Am I really successful or just kidding myself?  5. Have I lowered my standards to make myself a winner? Are  my friends, who are now making twice as much as three years  ago, really on the right track? O  ======================================== [Página 280] ======================================== 268 STEP  IV: L IS FOR LIBERATION  6. Why am I not happy? I can do anything and I'm still not happy.  Do I even deserve it?  Most of this can be overcome as soon as we recognize it for what  it is: outdated comparisons using the more-is-better and money-as- success mind-sets that got us into trouble to begin with. Even so,  there is a more profound observation to be made.  These doubts invade the mind when nothing else fills it. Think of  a time when you felt 100% alive and undistracted—in the zone.  Chances are that it was when you were completely focused in the  moment on something external: someone or something else. Sports  and sex are two great examples. Lacking an external focus, the mind  turns inward on itself and creates problems to solve, even if the  problems are undefined or unimportant. If you find a focus, an ambi- tious goal that seems impossible and forces you to grow,75 these  doubts disappear.  In the process of searching for a new focus, it is almost inevitable  that the "big" questions will creep in. There is pressure from pseudo- philosophers everywhere to cast aside the impertinent and answer the  eternal. Two popular examples are "What is the meaning of life?"  and "What is the point of it all?"  There are many more, ranging from the introspective to the  ontological, but I have one answer for almost all of them—I don't  answer them at all.  I'm no nihilist. In fact, I've spent more than a decade investigating  the mind and concept of meaning, a quest that has taken me from the  neuroscience laboratories of top universities to the halls of religious  institutions worldwide. The conclusion after it all is surprising.  I am 100%  convinced that most big questions we feel compelled  75. Abraham Maslow, the American psychologist famous for proposing "Mas-low's  Hierarchy of Needs," would term this goal a "peak experience."  ======================================== [Página 281] ======================================== Filling the Void 269  to face—handed down through centuries of overthinking and mis- translation—use terms so undefined as to make attem pting to answer  them a complete waste of time.76 This isn't depressing. It's liberating.  Consider the question of questions: What is the meaning of life?  If pressed, I have but one response: It is the characteristic state or  condition of a living organism. "But that's just a definition," the  questioner will retort, "that's not what I mean at all." What do you  mean, then? Until the question is clear—each term in it defined—  there is no point in answering it. The "meaning" of "life" question is  unanswerable without further elaboration.  Before spending time on a stress-inducing question, big or other- wise, ensure that the answer is "yes" to the following two questions:  i.   Have I decided on a single meaning for each term in this  question? 2.   Can an answer to this question be acted upon to  improve  things?  "What is the meaning of life?" fails the first and thus the second.  Questions about things beyond your sphere of influence like "What if  the train is late tomorrow?" fail the second and should thus be  ignored. These are not worthwhile questions. If you can't define it  or act upon it, forget it. If you take just this point from this book, it  will put you in the top i% of performers in the world and keep most  philosophical distress out of your life.  Sharpening your logical and practica l mental toolbox is not being  an atheist or unspiritual. It's not being crass and it's not being  superficial. It's being smart and putting your effort where it can make  the biggest difference for yourself and others.  76. There is a place for koans and rhetorical meditative questions, but these tools are  optional and outside the scope of this book. Most questions without answers are just  poorly worded.  ======================================== [Página 282] ======================================== 270 STEP IV: L IS FOR LIBERATION  The Point of It All: Drumroll, Please  What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather  the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely  chosen task.  —VIKTOR E. FRANKL, Holocaust survivor; author of Man's  Search for Meaning   believe that life exists to be enjoyed and that the most important thing is  to feel good  about yourself.  Each person will have his or her own vehicles for both, and those  vehicles will change over time. For some, the answer will be working with  orphans, and for others, it will be composing music. I have a personal  answer to both—to love, be loved, and never stop learning—but I don't  expect that to be universal.  Some criticize a focus on self-love and enjoyment as selfish or  hedonistic, but it's neither. Enjoying life and helping others—or feeling  good  about yourself and increasing the greater good —are no more mutually  exclusive than being agnostic and leading a moral life. One does not  preclude the other. Let's assume we agree on this. It still leaves the question,  "What can I do with my time to enjoy life and feel good  about myself?"  I can't offer a single answer that will fit all people, but, based on the  dozens of fulfilled NR I've interviewed, there are two components that are  fundamental: continual learning and service.

I see no other option. This is why I've felt com- pelled to quit or be fired from jobs within the first six months or  so. The learning curve flattens out and I get bored.  Though you can upgrade your brain domestically, traveling and  relocating provides unique conditions that make progress much  faster. The different surroundings act as a counterpoint and mirror for  your own prejudices, making weaknesses that much easier to fix. I  rarely travel somewhere without deciding first how I'll obsess on a  specific skill. Here are a few examples:  ■"Connemara, Ireland: Gaelic Irish, Irish flute, and  hurling, the fastest field sport in the world (imagine a mix of  lacrosse and rugby played with axe handles)  >-Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: Brazilian Portuguese and  Brazilian jujitsu  "-Berlin, Germany:  German and locking (a form of  upright break-dancing)  I tend to focus on language acquisition and one kinesthetic skill,  sometimes finding the latter after landing overseas.

It need not be a competitive sport—it could be  hiking, chess, or almost anything that keeps your nose out of a  textbook and you out of your apartment. Sports just happen to be  excellent for avoiding foreign-language stage fright and developing  lasting friendships while still sounding like Tarzan.  Language learning deserves special mention. It is, bar none, the  best thing you can do to hone clear thinking.  Quite aside from the fact that it is impossible to understand a  culture without understanding its language, acquiring a new language  makes you aware of your own language: your own thoughts.

Thousands of theoretical  linguists will disagree, but I know from research and personal  experimentation with more than a dozen languages that (i) adults can  learn languages much faster than children77 when constant 9-5 work  is removed and that (2) it is possible to become conversationally  fluent in any language in six months or less. At four hours per day,  six months can be whittled down to less than three months. It is  beyond the scope of this book  to explain applied linguistics and the  80/20 of language learning, but resources and complete how-to  guides can be found on www .fourhourworkweek.com. I learned six  languages after failing Spanish in high school, and you can do the  same with the right tools.  Gain a language and you gain a second lens through which to  question and understand the world. Cursing at people when you go  home is fun, too.

Morality is simply the attitude we adopt toward people we  personally dislike. —OSCAR WILDE  ne would expect me to mention service in this chapter, and here  it is.

Human life has long been focused on the exclusion of the  environment and the rest of the food chain, hence our current race to  imminent extinction. Serves us right. The world does not exist solely  for the betterment and multiplication of mankind.  Before I start chaining myself to trees and saving the dart frogs,  though, I should take my own advice: Do not become a cause snob.  How can you help starving children in Africa when there are  starving children in Los Angeles? How can you save the whales  when homeless people are freezing to death? How does doing vol- unteer research on coral destruction help those people who need help  now?  Children, please. Everything out there needs help, so don't get  baited into "my cause can beat up your cause" arguments with no  right answer. There are no qualitative or quantitative comparisons  that make sense. The truth is this: Those thousands of lives you save  could contribute to a famine that kills millions, or that one bush in  Bolivia that you protect could hold the cure for cancer. The down- stream effects are unkno wn. Do your best and hope for the best. If  you're improving the world—ho wever you define that—consider  your job well done.  Service isn't limited to saving lives or the environment either. It  can also improve life. If you are a musician and put a smile on the  faces of thousands or millions, I view that as service. If you are a  mentor and change the life of one child for the better, the world has  been improved. Improving the quality of life in the world is in no  fashion inferior to adding more lives.  Service is an attitude.  Find the cause or vehicle that interests you most and make no  apologies.  ======================================== [Página 286] ======================================== 274 STEP IV: L IS FOR LIBERATION  -Q&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS  Adults are always asking kids what they want to be when  they grow up because they are looking for ideas.  —PAULA POUNDSTONE  The miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk  on the green earth, dwelling deeply in the present moment  and feeling truly alive.  —THICH NHAT HANH  ut I can't just travel, learn languages, or fight for one cause for the  rest of my life! Of course you can't. That's not my suggestion at  all. These are just good "life hubs"—starting points that lead to  opportunities and experiences that otherwise wouldn't be found.  There is no right answer to the question "What should I do with my  life?" Forget "should" altogether. The next step—and that's all it is— is pursuing something, it matte rs little what, that seems fun or  rewarding. Don't be in a rush to jump into a full-time long-term  commitment. Take time to find something that calls to you, not just  the first acceptable form of surrogate work. That calling will, in turn,  lead you to something else.  Here is a good sequence for getting started that dozens of NR  have used with success.  i.   Revisit ground zero: Do nothing.  Before we can escape the goblins of the mind, we need to face  them. Principal among them is speed addiction. It is hard to re- calibrate your internal clock without taking a break from constant  overstimulation. Travel and the impulse to see a million things  can exacerbate this.  Slowing down doesn't mean accomplishing less; it means  cutting out counterproductive distractions and the perception of  being rushed. Consider attending a short silence retreat of 3-7  days during which all media and speaking is prohibited.

Take a learning mini-retirement in combination with local  volunteering.  Take a mini-retirement—six months or more if possible—to  focus on learning and serving. The longer duration will permit a  language focus, which in turn enables more meaningful interac- tion and contribution through volunteering.  For the duration of this trip, note self-criticisms and negative  self-talk in a journal. Whenever upset or anxious, ask "why" at  least three times and put the answers down on paper. Describing  these doubts in writing reduces their impact twofold. First, it's  often the ambiguous nature of self-doubt that hurts most. Defin- ing and exploring it in writing—just as with forcing colleagues to  e-mail—demands clarity of thought, after which most concerns  are found to be baseless. Second, recording these concerns seems  to somehow remove them from your head.  But where to go and what to do? There is no one right answer  to either. Use the following questions and resources to  brainstorm:  What makes you most angry about the state of the world?  What are you most afraid of for the next generation,  whether you have children or not? What makes you  happiest in your life? How can you help  others have the same?   There is no need to limit yourself to one location. Remember  Robin, who traveled through South America for a year with her  husband and seven-year-old son? The three of them spent one to  two months doing volunteer work in each location, including  building wheelchairs in Banos, Ecuador, rehabilitating exotic  animals in the Bolivian rain forest, and shepherding leather-back  sea turtles in Suriname.   How about doing archaeological excavation in Jordan or  tsunami relief on the islands of Thailand? These are just two of  ======================================== [Página 289] ======================================== Filling the Void 277  the dozens of foreign relocation and volunteering case studies in  each issue of Transitions Abroad magazine (www .transitions- abroad.com).

Revisit and reset dreamlines.  Following the mini-retirement, revisit the dreamlines set in  Definition and reset them as needed. The following questions will  help:  What are you good at?  What could you be the best at?  What makes you happy?  What excites you?  What makes you feel accomplished and good about  yourself? What are you most proud of having accomplished  in your  life? Can you repeat this or further develop it? What  do you enjoy sharing or experiencing with other  people?  5. Based on the outcomes of steps 1-4, consider testing new  part- or full-time vocations.  Full-time work isn't bad if it's what you'd rather be doing. This is  where we distinguish "work" from a "vocation."  ======================================== [Página 290] ======================================== 278 STEP IV: L IS FOR LIBERATION  If you have created a muse or cut your hours down to next to  nothing, consider testing a part-time or full-time vocation: a true  calling or dream occupation. This is what I did with this book. I  can now tell people I'm a writer rather than giving them the two- hour drug dealer explanation. What did you dream of being when  you were a kid? Perhaps it's time to sign up for Space Camp or  intern as an assistant to a marine biologist.  Recapturing the exciteme nt of childhood  isn't impossible. In  fact, it's required. There are no more chains—or excuses—to hold  you back.  ======================================== [Página 291] ======================================== The Top 13 New Rich Mistakes  If you don't make mistakes, you're not working on hard  enough problems. And that's a big mistake.  —FRANK WILCZEK, 2004  Nobel Prize winner in physics  Ho imparato che niente e impossibile, e anche che quasi niente e  facile . . . (I've learned that nothing is impossible, and that  almost nothing is easy ...) —ARTICOLO 31 (Italian rap group),  "Un Urlo"  u  mistakes are the name of the game in lifestyle design. It requires  fighting impulse after impulse from the old world of retirement-based life  deferral. Here are the slipups you will make. Don't get frustrated. It's all part  of the process.  1. Losing sight of dreams and falling into work for work's sake  (W4W) Please reread the introduction and next chapter of this book  whenever you feel yourself falling into this trap. Everyone does it, but  many get stuck and never get out.  2. Micromanaging and e-mailing to fill time Set the responsibilities,  problem scenarios and rules, and limits of autonomous decision- making—then stop, for the sanity of everyone involved.  3. Handling problems your outsourcers or co-workers can handle  4. Helping outsourcers or co-workers with the same problem more  than once, or with noncrisis problems  Give them if-then  ======================================== [Página 292] ======================================== 280 STEP IV: L IS FOR LIBERATION  rules for solving all but the largest problems. Give them the free- dom to act without your input, set the limits in writing, and then  emphasize in writing that you will not respond to help with  problems that are covered by these rules. In my particular case,  all outsourcers have at their discretion the ability to fix any prob- lem that will cost less than $400.  At the end of each month or  quarter, depending on the outsourcer, I review how their decisions  have affected profit and adjust the rules accordingly, often adding  new rules based on their good decisions and creative solutions.  5. Chasing customers, particularly unqua lified or international  prospects, when you have sufficient cash flow to finance your  nonfinancial pursuits  6. Answering e-mail that will not result in a sale or that can  be answered by a FAQ or auto-responder For a good example  of an auto-responder that directs people to the appropriate in- formation and outsourcers, e-mail info@brainquicken.com.  7. Working where you live, sleep, or should relax Separate  your environments—designate a single space for work and solely  work—or you will never be able to escape it.  8. Not performing a thorough  80/20 analysis every two to four  weeks for your business and personal life  9. Striving for endless perfection rather than great or sim- ply good enough, whether in your personal or professional life  Recognize that this is often just another W4W excuse. Most en- deavors are like learning to speak a foreign language: to be  correct 95% of the time requires six months of concentrated ef- fort, whereas to be correct 98% of the time requires 20-30 years.  Focus on great for a few things and good enough for the rest.  Perfection is a good ideal and direction to have, but recognize it  for what it is: an impossible destination.  10. Blowing minutiae and small problems out of proportion as an  excuse to work  ======================================== [Página 293] ======================================== The Top 13 New Rich Mistakes 281  11. Making non-time-sensitive issues urgent in order to jus- tify work How many times do I have to say it? Focus on life out- side of your bank accounts, as scary as that void can be in the  initial stages. If you cannot find meaning in your life, it is your  responsibility as a human being to create it, whether that is ful- filling dreams or finding work that gives you purpose and self- worth—ideally a combination of both.  12. Viewing one product, job, or project as the end-all and  be-all of your existence Life is too short to waste, but it is also  too long to be a pessimist or nihilist. Whatever you're doing now  is just a stepping-stone to the next project or adventure. Any rut  you get into is one you can get yourself out of. Doubts are no  more than a signal for action of some type. When in doubt or  overwhelmed, take a break and 80/20 both business and personal  activities and relationships.  13. Ignoring the social rewards of life Surround yourself with  smiling, positive people who have absolutely nothing to do with  work. Create your muses alone if you must, but do not live your  life alone. Happiness shared in the form of friendships and love is  happiness multiplied.  ======================================== [Página 294] ========================================   ======================================== [Página 295] ======================================== The Last Chapter  -AN E-MAIL YOU NEED TO READ  There is nothing the busy man is less busied with than liv  ing; there is nothing harder to learn. —SENECA  For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every  morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my  life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?" And  whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a  row, I know I need to change something . . . almost every- thing—all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embar- rassment or failure—these things just fall away in the face of  death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that  you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of  thinking you have something to lose. —STEVE JOBS, college  dropou t and CEO of Apple Computer, Stanford University  Commencement, 200578  I  .f you're confused about life, you're not alone. There are almost seven  billion of us. This isn't a problem, of course, once you realize that life is  neither a problem to be solved nor a game to be won.  If you are too intent on making the pieces of a nonexistent puzzle fit,  you miss out on all the real fun. The heaviness of success-chasing can be  replaced with a serendipitous lightness when you recognize that the only  rules and limits are those we set for ourselves.  78. http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html.  ======================================== [Página 296] ======================================== 284 STEP IV: L IS FOR LIBERATION  So be bold and don't worry about what people think. They don't  do it that often anyway.  Two years ago, I received an e-mail from a terminally ill girl in a  New York hospital. I have reread one portion of her letter many  times since and I hope you will do the same. Here it is.  SLOW   DANCE  Have you ever watched kids  On a merry-go-round?  Or listened to the rain  Slapping on the ground?   Ever followed a butterfly's erratic flight?  Or gazed at the sun into the fading night?  You better slow down .  Don't dance so fast.  Time is short.  The music won't last.  Do you run through each day  On the fly?  Whenyou ash How are you? Do  you hear the reply?  When the day is done,  do you lie in your bed  With the next hundred chores  Running through your head?  You'd better slow down .  Don't dance so fast.  ======================================== [Página 297] ======================================== The Last Chapter 285  Time is short.  The music won't last.  Ever toldyour child,  We'll do it tomorrow?  And inyour haste, Not  see his sorrow?  Ever lost touch,  Let a good  friendship die  Cause you never had time  To call and say, "Hi"?  You'd better slow down.  Don't dance so fast.  Time is short.  The music won't last.  Whenyou run so fast to get somewhere  You miss half the fun of getting there.  Whenyou worry and hurry through your day,  It is like an unop ened gift thrown awa y.  Life is not a race.  Do take it slower.

The Fundamental Four: Let Me Explain  he Fundamental Four are so named because they are the four  books I recomme nded to aspiring lifestyle designers prior to  writing The 4-Hour Workweek. Still well worth reading, here is the  sequence I suggest: T ======================================== [Página 300] ======================================== 288 Restricted Reading  The Magic of Thinking Big (192 pages)  BY DAVID SCHWARTZ  This book was first recommended to me by Stephen Key, an ultrasuccess- ful inventor who has made millions licensing products to companies, in- cluding Disney, Nestle, and Coca-Cola. It is the favorite book of many  superperformers worldwide, ranging from legendary football coaches to  famous CEOs, and has more than 100 5-star ratings on Amazon. The main  message is don't overestimate others and underestimate yourself. I still read  the first two chapters of this book whenever doubt creeps in.  How to Make Millions with Your Ideas: An  Entrepreneur's Guide (zyi pages)  BY DAN S. KENNEDY  This is a menu of options for converting ideas into millions. I read this when  I was in high school and have read it five times since. It is like steroids for  your entrepreneurship cortex. The case studies, from Domino's Pizza to  casinos and mail-order products, are outstanding.  The E-Myth Revisited: Why Most Small Businesses Don't  Work and What to Do About It (288 pages)  BY MICHAEL E. GERBER   Gerber is a masterful storyteller and his classic of automation discusses how  to use a franchise mind-set to create scalable businesses that are based on  rules and not outstanding employees. It is an excellent road map—told in  parable—for becoming an owner instead of constant micromanager. If  you're stuck in your own business, this book will get you unstuck in no  time.  Vagabonding: An Uncommon Guide to the Art of Long-Term  World Travel (224 pages)  BY ROL F POTTS  Rolf is the man. This is the book that got me to stop making excuses and  pack for an extended hiatus. It covers bits of everything but is particularly  helpful for determining your destination, adjusting to life on the road, and  re-assimilating back into ordinary life. It includes great little excerpts from  famous vagabonds, philosophers, and explorers, as well as anecdotes from  ======================================== [Página 301] ======================================== Restricted Reading 289  ordinary travelers. This is the first of two books (the other was Walden,  below) that I took with me on my first 15-month mini-retirement.  Reducing Emotional and Material Baggage  Walden (384 pages)  BY HENRY  DAVID THOR EAU  This is considered by many to be the masterpiece of reflective simple living.  Thoreau lived on the edge of a small lake in rural Massachusetts for two  years, building his own shelter and living alone, as an experiment in self- reliance and minimalism. It was both a huge success and a failure, which is  what makes this book such a compelling read.  Less Is More: The Art of Voluntary Poverty— An  Anthology of Ancient and Modern Voices in Praise of  Simplicity (336 pages)  EDITED  BY GOLDIAN  VANDENBROECK   This is a collection of bite-sized philosophies on simple living. I read it to  learn how to do the most with the least and eliminate artificial needs, not  live like a monk—big difference. It incorporates actionable principles and  short stories ranging from Socrates to Benjamin Franklin and the Bhaga-vad  Gita to modern economists.  The Monk and the Riddle: The Education of a Silicon  Valley Entrepreneur (192 pages)  BY RANDY  KOMISAR  This great book was given to me by Professor Zschau as a graduation gift  and introduced me to the phrase "deferred-life plan." Randy, a virtual CEO  and partner at the legendary Kleiner Perkins, has been described as a  "combined professional mentor, minister without portfolio, in-your-face  investor, trouble-shooter and door opener." Let a true Silicon Valley wizard  show you how he created his ideal life using razor-sharp thinking and  Buddhist-like philosophies. I've met him—he's the real deal.  ======================================== [Página 302] ======================================== 290 Restricted Reading  The 80/20 Principle: The Secret to Success by  Achieving More with Less (288 pages)  BY RICHARD KOCH   This book explores the "nonlinear" world, discusses the mathematical and  historical support for the 80/20 Principle, and offers practical applications  of the same.  Muse Creation and Related Skills  Harvard Business School Case Studies www .hbsp.harvard.edu (click on  "school cases") One of the secrets behind Harvard Business School's  teaching success is the case method—using real-life case studies for  discussion. These cases take you inside the marketing and operational plans  of 24-Hour Fitness, Southwest Airlines, Timberland, and hundreds of other  companies. Few people realize that you can purchase these case studies for  less than $10 apiece instead of spending more than $100,000 to go to  Harvard (not that the latter isn't worth it). There is a case study for every  situation, problem, and business model.  "This business has legs": How I Used Infomercial Marketing to  Create the $100 ,000,000 Thighmaster Craze: An Entrepreneurial  Adventure Story (206 pages)  BY PETER BIELER  This is the story of how a naive (in the best sense of the word) Peter Bieler  started from scratch—no product, no experience, no cash—and created a  $ioo-million merchandising empire in less than two years. It is a mind- expanding and often hysterical case study that uses real numbers to discuss  the fine points of everything from dealing with celebrities to marketing,  production, legal, and retail. Peter can now finance the media purchases for  your product: www.mediafunding.com.  Secrets of Power Negotiating: Inside Secretsfrom a  Master Negotiator (256 pages)  BY ROGER  DAWSON  This is the one negotiating book that really opened my eyes and gave me  ======================================== [Página 303] ======================================== ^  Restricted Reading 291  practical tools I could use immediately. I used the audio adaptation. If you're  hungry for more, William Ury's Getting Past No and G. Richard Shell's  Bargaining for Advantage: Negotiation Strategies for Reasonable People are  outstanding. These are the only negotiating books you'll ever need.  Response Magazine  (www .responsemagazine.com)  This magazine is dedicated to the multibillion-dollar direct response (DR)  industry, with a focus on television, radio, and Internet marketing. How-to  articles (increasing sales per call, lowering media costs, improving fulfill- ment, etc.) are interspersed with case studies of successful campaigns  (George Foreman Grill, Girls Gone Wild, etc.). The best outsourcers in the  business also advertise in this magazine. This is an excellent resource at an  excellent price—free.  Jordan Whitney Greensheet  (www.jwgreensheet.com)  This is an insider secret of the DR world. Jordan Whitney's weekly and  monthly reports dissect the most successful product campaigns, including  offers, pricing, guarantees, and ad frequencies (indicative of spending and,  thus, profitability). The publication also maintains an up-to-date tape library  from which infomercials and spot comm ercials can be purchased for  competitive research. Highly recomm ended.  Small Giants: Companies That Choose to Be Great Instead  of Big (256 pages)  BY BO BURLINGH AM  Longtime Inc. magazine editor-at-large Bo Burlingham crafts a beautiful  collage and analysis of companies that focus on being the best instead of  growing like cancer into huge corporations. Companies include Clif Bar  Inc., Anchor Stream Microbrewery, rock star Ani DiFranco's Righteous  Babe Records, and a dozen more from different industries. Bigger is not  better, and this book proves it.  ======================================== [Página 304] ======================================== 292 Restricted Reading  Negotiating World Travel and Preparing for Escape  Six Months Off: How to Plan, Negotiate, and Take the  Break You Need Without Burning Bridges or Going Broke  (252 pages)  BY HOPE DLUGOZIMA, JAMES SCOTT, AND  DAV ID SHARP  This was the first book to make me step back and say, "Holy sh*t. I can ac- tually do this!" It steamrolls over most fear factors related to long-term  travel and offers a step-by-step guide to taking time off to travel or pursue  other goals without giving up your career. Full of case studies and useful  checklists.
