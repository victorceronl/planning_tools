CHAPTER 1 
That's what makes death so hard-unsatisfied curiosity. 
-BERYL MARKHAM, 
West with the Night1 
od is the enemy of great. 
And that is one of the key reasons why we have so little that becomes 
great. 
We don't have great schools, principally because we have good schools. 
We don't have great government, principally because we have good gov- 
ernment. Few people attain great lives, in large part because it is just so 
easy to settle for a good life. The vast majority of companies never become 
great, precisely because the vast majority become quite good-and that is 
their main problem. 
This point became piercingly clear to me in 1996, when I was having 
dinner with a group of thought leaders gathered for a discussion about 
organizational performance. Bill Meehan, the managing director of the 
San Francisco office of McKinsey & Company, leaned over and casually 
confided, "You know, Jim, we love Built to Last around here. You and 
your coauthor did a very fine job on the research and writing. Unfortu - 
nately, it's useless. " 
Curious, I asked him to explain. 
"The companies you wrote about were, for the most part, always great, " 
he said. "They never had to turn themselves from good companies into 
great companies. They had parents like David Packard and George 
Merck, who shaped the character of greatness from early on. But what 
about the vast majority of companies that wake up partway through life 
and realize that they're good, but not great? " 
I now realize that Meehan was exaggerating for effect with his "useless " 
comment, but his essential observation was correct- that truly great com-

panies, for the most part, have always been great. And the vast majority of 
good companies remain just that-good, but not great. Indeed, Meehan's 
comment proved to be an invaluable gift, as it planted the seed of a ques - 
tion that became the basis of this entire book-namely, Can a good com- 
pany become a great company and, if so, how? Or is the disease of "just 
being good" incurable? 
Five years after that fateful dinner we can now say, without question, that 
good to great does happen, and we've learned much about the underlying 
variables that make it happen. Inspired by Bill Meehan's challenge, my 
research team and I embarked on a five-year research effort, a journey to 
explore the inner workings of good to great. 
To quickly grasp the concept of the project, look at the chart on page 2. " 
In essence, we identified companies that made the leap from good results 
to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. We com - 
pared these companies to a carefull y selected control group of comparison 
companies that failed to make the leap, or if they did, failed to sustain it. 
We then compared the good-to-great companies to the comparison com - 
panies to discover the essential and distinguishing factors at work. 
The good-to-great examples that made the final cut into the study 
attained extraordinary results, averaging cumulative stock returns 6.9 
times the general market in the fifteen years following their transition 
points.2 To put that in perspective, General Electric (considered by many 
to be the best-led company in America at the end of the twentieth cen- 
tury) outperformed the market by 2.8 times over the fifteen years 1985 to 
2000.3 Furthermore, if you invested $1 in a mutual fund of the good-to- 
great companies in 1965, holding each company at the general market 
rate until the date of transition, and simultaneously invested $1 in a gen- 
eral market stock fund, your $1 in the good-to-great fund taken out on 
January 1, 2000, would have multiplied 471 times, compared to a 56 fold 
increase in the 
market.4 
These are remarkable numbers, made all the more remarkable when 
you consider the fact that they came from companies that had previously 
been so utterly unremarkable. Consider just one case, Walgreens. For over 
forty years, Walgreens had bumped along as a very average company, 
more or less tracking the general market. Then in 1975, seemingly out of 
nowhere -bang!-Walgreens began to clinib . . . and climb. . . and

technology superstar Intel by nearly two times, General Electric by nearly 
five times, Coca -Cola by nearly eight times, and the general stock market 
(including the NASDAQ stock run-up at the end of 1999) by over fifteen 
times.* 
How on earth did a company with such a long history of being nothing 
special transform itself into an enterprise that outperformed some of the 
best-led organizations in the world? And why was Walgreens able to make 
the leap when other companies in the same industry with the same oppor - 
tunities and similar resources, such as Eckerd, did not make the leap? 
This single case captures the essence of our quest.

nies we studied. It is about the question -Can a good company become a 
great company and, if so, how?-and our search for timeless, universal 
answers that can be applied by any organization. 
This book is dedicated to teaching what we've learned. The remainder 
of this introductory chapter tells the story of our journey, outlines our 
research method, and previews the key findings. In chapter 2, we launch 
headlong into the findings themselves, beginning with one of the most 
provocative of the whole study: Level 5 leadership. 
UNDAUNTED CURIOSITY 
People often ask, "What motivates you to undertake these huge research 
projects? " It's a good question. The answer is, "Curiosity. " There is noth- 
ing I find more exciting than picking a question that I don't know the 
answer to and embarking on a quest for answers. It's deeply satisfying to 
climb into the boat, like Lewis and Clark, and head west, saying, "We 
don't know what we'll find when we get there, but we'll be sure to let you 
know when we get back. " 
Here is the abbreviated story of this particular odyssey of curiosity. 
Phase 1: The Search 
With the question in hand, I began to assemble a team of researchers. 
(When I use "we" throughout this book, I am referring to the research 
team. In all, twenty -one people worked on the project at key points, usu- 
ally in teams of four to six at a time.) 
Our first task was to find companies that showed the good -to-great pat - 
tern exemplified in the chart on page 2. We launched a six-month "death 
march of financial analysis, " looking for companies that showed the fol-

lowing basic pattern: fifteen -year cumulative stock returns at or below the 
general stock market, punctuated by a transition point, then cumulative 
returns at least three times the market over the next fifteen years. We 
picked fifteen years because it would transcend one-hit wonders and 
lucky breaks (you can't just be lucky for fifteen years) and would exceed 
the average tenure of most chief executive officers (helping us to separate 
great companies from companies that just happened to have a single 
great leader). We picked three times the market because it exceeds the 
performance of most widely acknowledged great companies. For per - 
spective, a mutual fund of the following "marquis set" of companies beat 
the market by only 2.5 times over the years 1985 to 2000: 3M, Boeing, 
Coca -Cola, GE, Hewlett -Packard, Intel, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, 
Motorola, Pepsi, Procter & Gamble, Wal-Mart, and Walt Disney. Not a 
bad set to beat. 
From an initial universe of companies that appeared on the Fortune 500 
in the years 1965 to 1995, we systematically searched and sifted, eventually 
finding eleven good -to-great examples. (I've put a detailed description of 
our search in Appendix l.A.) However, a couple of points deserve brief 
mention here. First, a company had to demonstrate the good -to-great pat - 
tern independent of its industry; if the whole industry showed the same pat- 
tern, we dropped the company. Second, we debated whether we should 
use additional selection criteria beyond cumulative stock returns, such as 
impact on society and employee welfare. We eventually decided to limit 
our selection to the good -to-great results pattern, as we could not conceive 
of any legitimate and consistent method for selecting on these other vari- 
ables without introducing our own biases. In the last chapter, however, I 
address the relationship between corporate values and enduring great com- 
panies, but the focus of this particular research effort is on the very specific 
question of how to turn a good organization into one that produces sus- 
tained great results. 
At first glance, we were surprised by the list. Who would have thought 
that Fannie Mae would beat companies like GE and Coca -Cola? Or that 
Walgreens could beat Intel? The surprising list-a dowdier group would 
be hard to find-taught us a key lesson right up front. It is possible to turn 
good into great in the most unlikely of situations. This became the first of 
many surprises that led us to reevaluate our thinking about corporate 
greatness. 
======================================== [Página 9] ========================================

Phase 3: Inside the Black Box 
We then turned our attention to a deep analysis of each case. We col- 
lected all articles published on the twenty -eight companies, dating back 
fifty years or more. We systematically coded all the material into cate- 
gories, such as strategy, technology, leadership, and so forth. Then we 
interviewed most of the good -to-great executives who held key positions of 
responsibility during the transition era. We also initiated a wide range of 
qualitative and quantitative analyses, looking at everything from acquisi - 
tions to executive compensation, from business strategy to corporate cul- 
ture, from layoffs to leadership style, from financial ratios to management 
turnover. When all was said and done, the total project consumed 10.5 
people years of effort. We read and systematicall y coded nearly 6,000 arti- 
cles, generated more than 2,000 pages of interview transcripts, and cre- 
ated 384 million bytes of computer data. (See Appendix 1 .D for a detailed 
list of all our analyses and activities.) 
We came to think of our research effort as akin to looking inside a black 
box. Each step along the way was like installing another lightbulb to shed 
light on the inner workings of the good -to-great process. 
With data in hand, we began a series of weekly research -team debates. 
For each of the twenty -eight companies, members of the research team 
and I would systematically read all the articles, analyses, interviews, and 
the research coding. I would make a presentation to the team on that spe- 
cific company, drawing potential conclusions and asking questions. Then 
we would debate, disagree, pound on tables, raise our voices, pause and 
======================================== [Página 10] ========================================

lo lim Collins 
reflect, debate some more, pause and think, discuss, resolve, question, and 
debate yet again about "what it all means. " 
The core of our method was a systematic process of contrasting the 
good -to-great examples to the comparisons, always asking, "What's differ - 
ent?" 
We also made particular note of "dogs that did not bark." In the Sher- 
lock Holmes classic "The Adventure of Silver Blaze, " Holmes identified 
"the curious incident of the dog in the night -time7' as the key clue. It turns 
out that the dog did nothing in the nighttime and that, according to 
Holmes, was the curious incident, which led him to the conclusion that 
the prime suspect must have been someone who knew the dog well. 
In our study, what we didn't find-dogs that we might have expected to 
bark but didn't- turned out to be some of the best clues to the inner work - 
ings of good to great. When we stepped inside the black box and turned 
on the lightbulbs, we were frequently just as astonished at what we did not 
see as what we did. For example: 
Larger -than-life, celebrity leaders who ride in from the outside are 
negatively correlated with taking a company from good to great. Ten 
of eleven good -to-great CEOs came from inside the company, 
whereas the comparison companies tried outside CEOs six times 
more often. 
We found no systematic pattern linking specific forms of executive 
compensation to the process of going from good to great. The idea 
that the structure of executive compensation is a key driver in corpo - 
rate performance is simply not supported by the data. 
Strategy per se did not separate the good -to-great companies from the 
comparison companies. Both sets of companies had well-defined 
strategies, and there is no evidence that the good-to-great companies -_

======================================== [Página 11] ========================================

Good to Great 11 
The good -to-great companies did not focus principally on what to do 
to become - great; they focused equally -- on whatnot to do and whgto 
stop --- doing. - . 
Technology and technology -driven change has virtually nothing to do 
with igniting a transformation from good to great. Technology_can - 
accelerate a transformation, but technology cannot cause a transfor - 
mation. - -- 
Mergers and acquisitions play virtually no role in igniting a transfor - 
mation from good to great; two big mediocrities joined together never 
make one great company. 
The good -to-great companies paid scant attention to managing 
change, motivating people, or creating alignment. Under the right 
conditions, the problems of commitment, alignment, motivation, and 
change largely melt away. 
The good -to-great companies had no name, tag line, launch event, or 
program to signify their transformations. Indeed, some reported being 
unaware of the magnitude of the transformation at the time; only 
later, in retrospect, did it become clear. Yes, they produced a truly rev- 
olutionary leap in results, but not by a revolutionary process. 
The good -to-great companies were not, by and large, in great indus - 
tries, and some were in terrible industries. In no case do we have a 
company that just happened to be sitting on the nose cone of a rocket 
when it took off. Greatness is not a function of circumstance. Great - 
ness, it turns out, is largely a matter of conscious choice. 
Phase 4: Chaos to Concept 
I've tried to come up with a simple way to convey what was required to go 
from all the data, analyses, debates, and "dogs that did not bark to the 
final findings in this book. The best answer I can give is that it was an itgr- 
a$ve Drocess of looping back and forth, developing ideas and testing them 
against the - data, revising the -- ideas, building - ---. a framework, -v -- seeingitircak 
under the weight of evidence, and rebuilding 
 it;yet_agin. That process 
was repeated over and over, until everything hung together in a coherent 
framework of concepts. We all have a strength or two in life, and I suppose 
mine is the ability to take a lump of unorganized information, see pat- 
terns, and extract order from the mess-to 
&r-chaos to concept. 
That said, however, I wish to underscore again that the concepts in the 
final framework are not my "opinions. " While I cannot extract my own 
======================================== [Página 12] ========================================

12 lim Collins 
psychology and biases entirely from the research, each finding in the final 
framework met a rigorous standard before the research team would deem 
it significant. Every primary concept in the final framework showed up as 
a change variable in 100 percent of the good -to-great companies and in 
less than 30 percent of the comparison companies during the pivotal 
years. Any insight that failed this test did not make it into the book as a 
chapter -level concept. 
Here, then, is an overview of the framework of concepts and a preview 
of what's to come in the rest of the book. (See the diagram below.) Think 
of the transformation as a process of buildup followed by breakthrough, 
broken into three broad stages: 
 dmked people, disciplined thought, 
and disciplined action. Within each of these three stages, there are two 
key concepts, shown in the framework and described below. Wrapping 
around this entire framework is a concept we came to call the flywheel, 
which captures the gestalt of the entire process of going from good to 
great. 
Level 5 Leadership. We were surprised, shocked really, to discover the 
type of leadership required for turning a good company into a great one. 
Compared to high-profile leaders with big personalities who make head - 
lines and become celebrities, the good -to-great leaders seem to have come 
from Mars. Self-effacing, quiet, reserved, even shy-these leaders are a 
======================================== [Página 13] ========================================

1 Good to Great 13 
paradoxical blend of personal humility and professional will. They are 
more like Lincoln and Socrates than Patton or Caesar. 
First Who. . . Then What. We expected that good -to-great leaders would 
begin by setting a new vision and strategy. We found instead that they first 
got the right people on the bus, the wrong people off the bus, and the right 
people in the right seats -and then they figured out where to drive it. The 
old adage "People are your most important asset" turns out to be wrong. 
People are not your most important asset. The right people are. - --- - 
I PC p*;w 
Confidht the Brutal Facts (Yet Never Lose Faith). We learned that a for- 
mer prisoner of war had more to teach us about what it takes to find a path 
to greatness than most books on corporate strategy. Every good -to-great 
3, 
company embraced what we came to call the Stockdale Paradox: You must 
maintain unwavering faith that you can and will prevail in the end, regard - 
less of the difficulties, AND at the same time have the discipline to con - 
front the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they might be. 
The Hedgehog Concept (Simplicity within the Three Circles). To go 
from good to great requires 
 tran%e~&n"Che curse of competence. Just 
because something is your core business- just because you've been doing 
it for years or perhaps even decades-does not necessarily mean you can 
be the best in the world at it. And if you cannot be the best in the world at 
your core business, then your core business absolutel y cannot form the 
basis of a great company. It must be replaced with a simple concept that 
reflects deep understanding of three intersecting circles. 
A Culture of Discipline. All companies have a culture, some companies 
have discipline, but few companies have a culture of discipline. When you 
have disciplined people, you don't need hierarchy. When you have disci- 
plined thought, you don't need bureaucracy. When you have disciplined 
action, you don't need excessive controls. When you combine a culture of 
discipline with an ethic of entrepreneurship, you get the magical alchemy 
of great performance. 
'#*@ . v' 
Technology Accelerators. Good -to-great companies think differently 
about the role of technology. They never use technology as the primary 
means of igniting a transformation. Yet, paradoxically, they are pioneers 
in the application of carefully selected technologies. We learned that 
======================================== [Página 14] ========================================

technology by itself is never a primary, root cause of either greatness or 
decline. 
The Flywheel and the Doom Loop. Those who launch revolutions, dra - 
matic change programs, and wrenching restructurings will almost cer- 
tainly fail to make the leap from good to great. No matter how dramatic 
the end result, the good-to-great transformations never happened in one 
fell swoop. There was no single defining action, no grand program, no 
one killer innovation, no solitary lucky break, no miracle moment. 
C K' L 
Rather, the process resembled relentlessly pushing a giant heavy flywheel 
in one direction, turn upon turn, building momentum until a point of 
breakthrough, and beyond.

If you are already a student of Built to Last, please set aside your ques - 
tions about the precise links between the two studies as you embark upon 
the findings in Good to Great. In the last chapter, I return to this question 
and link the two studies together. 
THE TIMELESS "PHYSICS " OF GOOD TO GREAT 
I had just finished presenting my research to a set of Internet executives 
gathered at a conference, when a hand shot up. "Will your findings con- 
tinue to apply in the new economy? Don't we need to throw out all the 
old ideas and start from scratch? " It's a legitimate question, as we do live in 
a time of dramatic change, and it comes up so often that I'd like to dis- 
pense with it right up front, before heading into the meat of the book. 
======================================== [Página 15] ========================================

Yes, the world is changing, and will continue to do so. But that does not 
mean we should stop the search for timeless principles. Think of it this 
way: While the practices of engineering continually evolve and change, 
the laws of physics remain relatively fixed. I like to think of our work as a 
search for timeless principles -the enduring physics of great organiza - 
tions-that will remain true and relevant no matter how the world 
changes around us. Yes, the specific application will change (the engi- 
neering), but certain immutable laws of organized human performance 
(the physics) will endure. 
The truth is, there's nothing new about being in a new economy. Those 
who faced the invention of electricity, the telephone, the automobile, the 
radio, or the transistor -did they feel it was any less of a new economy 
than we feel today? And in each rendition of the new economy, the best 
leaders have adhered to certain basic principles, with rigor and discipline. 
Some people will point out that the scale and pace of change is greater 
today than anytime in the past. Perhaps. Even so, some of the companies 
in our good -to-great study faced rates of change that rival anything in the 
new economy. For example, during the early 1980s, the banking industry 
was completely transformed in about three years, as the full weight of 
deregulation came crashing down. It was certainly a new economy for the 
banking industry! Yet Wells Fargo applied every single finding in this book 
to produce great results, right smack in the middle of the fast-paced 
change triggered by deregulation. 
This might come as a surprise, but I don't primarily think of my work as 
about the study of business, nor do I see this as fundamentally a business 
book. Rather, I see my work as being about discovering what creates 
enduring great organizations of any type. I'm curious to understand the 
======================================== [Página 16] ========================================

16 {im Collins 
fundamental differences between great and good, between excellent and 
mediocre. I just happen to use corporations as a means of getting inside 
the black box. I do this because publicly traded corporations, unlike other 
types of organizations, have two huge advantages for research: a widely 
agreed upon definition of results (so we can rigorously select a study set) 
and a plethora of easily accessible data. 
That good is the enemy of great is not just a business problem. It is a 
human problem. If we have cracked the code on the question of good to 
great, we should have something of value to any type of organization. 
Good schools might become great schools. Good newspapers might 
become great newspapers. Good churches might become great churches. 
Good government agencies might become great agencies. And good com- 
panies might become great companies. 
So, I invite you to join me on an intellectual adventure to discover what 
it takes to turn good into great. I also encourage you to question and chal- 
lenge what you learn. As one of my favorite professors once said, "The best 
students aFe those who never quite believe their professors. " True enough. 
But he also said, "One ought not to reject the data merely because one 
does not like what the data implies. " I offer everything herein for your 
thoughtful consideration, not blind acceptance. You're the judge and 
jury. Let the evidence speak.

CHAPTER 2 
You can accomplish anything in life, provided that you do not 
mind who gets the credit. 
1971, a seemingly ordinary man named Darwin E. Smith became 
chief executive of Kimberly -Clark, a stodgy old paper company whose 
stock had fallen 36 percent behind the general market over the previous 
twenty years. 
Smith, the company's mild -mannered in -house lawyer, wasn't so sure 
the board had made the right choice-a feeling further reinforced when a 
director pulled Smith aside and reminded him that he lacked some of the 
qualifications for the 
po~ition.~ But CEO he was, and CEO he remained 
for twenty years. 
What a twenty years it was. In that period, Smith created a stunning 
transformation, turning Kimberly -Clark into the leading paper -based 
consumer products company in the world. Under his stewardship, Kim- 
berly-Clark generated cumulative stock returns 4.1 times the general mar- 
ket, handily beating its direct rivals Scott Paper and Procter & Gamble

and outperforming such venerable companies as Coca-Cola, Hewlett- 
Packard, 3M, and General Electric. 
It was an impressive performance, one of the best examples in the twen- 
tieth century of taking a good company and making it great. Yet few peo- 
ple-even ardent students of management and corporate history-know 
anything about Darwin Smith. He probably would have liked it that way. 
A man who carried no airs of self-importance, Smith found his favorite 
companionship among plumbers and electricians and spent his vacations 
rumbling around his Wisconsin farm in the cab of a backhoe, digging 
holes and moving 
 rocks.3 He never cultivated hero status or executive 
celebrity 
  tatu us.^ When a journalist asked him to describe his manage - 
ment style, Smith, dressed unfashionably like a farm boy wearing his first 
suit bought at J. C. Penney, just stared back from the other side of his 
nerdy -looking black-rimmed glasses. After a long, uncomfortable silence, 
he said simply: "E~centric."~ The Wall Street Journal did not write a 
splashy feature on Darwin Smith. 
But if you were to think of Darwin Smith as somehow meek or soft, you 
would be terribly mis!aken. Has.awkward shyness and lack of pretense was : 
coupled with a fief$ - even stoic, resolve toward life. Smith grew up as a 
poor Indiana farm-town boy, putting himself through college by working 
the day shift at International Harvester and attending Indiana University 
at night. One day, he lost part of a finger on the job. The story goes that he 
went to class that evening and returned to work the next day. While that 
might be a bit of an exaggeration, he clearly did not let a lost finger slow 
down his progress toward graduation. He kept working full-time, he kept 
going to class at night, and he earned admission to Harvard Law SchooL6 
Later in life, two months after becoming CEO, doctors diagnosed Smith 
with nose and throat cancer, predicting he had less than a year to live. He 
informed the board but made it clear that he was not dead yet and had no 
plans to die anytime soon. Smith held fully to his demanding work sched- 
ule while commuting weekly from Wisconsin to Houston for radiation 
therapy and lived twenty-five more years, most of them as CEO.' 
Smith brought that same ferocious resolve to rebuilding Kimberly- 
Clark, especially when he made the most dramatic decision in the com- 
pany's history: Sell the mills.$ Shortly after he became CEO, Smith and 
his team had concluded that the traditional core business -coated 
paper-was doomed to mediocrity. Its economics were bad and the com- 
petition

fire of the consumer paper -products industry, world -class competition like 
Procter & Gamble would force it to achieve greatness or perish. 
So, like the general who burned the boats upon landing, leaving only 
one option (succeed or die), Smith announced the decision to sell the 
mills, in what one board member called the gutsiest move he'd ever seen 
a CEO make. Sell even the mill in Kimberly, Wisconsin, and throw all 
the proceeds into the consumer business, investing in brands like Huggies 
and Kleenex.l0 
The business media called the move stupid and Wall Street analysts 
downgraded the stock." Smith never wavered. Twenty -five years later, 
Kimberly -Clark owned Scott Paper outright and beat Procter & Gamble 
in six of eight product categories.12 In retirement, Smith reflected on his 
exceptional performance, saying simply, "I never stopped trying to 
become qualified for the job."13

NOT WHAT WE EXPECTED 
I 
Darwin Smith stands as a classic example of what we came to call a Level 
i 5 leader-an individual who blends extreme personal humility with 
intense professional will. We found leaders of this type at the helm of 
every good -to-great company during the transition era. Like Smith, they 
were self-effacing individuals who displa yed the fierce resolve to do what - 
ever needed to be done to make the company great. 
The term Level 5 refers to the highest level in a hierarchy of executive 
capabilities that we identified in our research. (See the diagram on page 
20.) While you don't need to move in sequence from Level 1 to Level 
5-it might be possible to fill in some of the lower levels later-fully 
developed Level 5 leaders embody all five layers of the pyramid. I am not 
going to belabor all five levels here, as Levels 1 through 4 are somewhat 
self-explanatory and are discussed extensively by other authors. This 
chapter will focus instead on the distinguishing traits of the good -to-great 
leaders-namely level 5 traits-in contrast to the comparison leaders in 
our study. 
But first, please permit a brief digression to set an important context. 
We were not looking for Level 5 leadership or anything like it. In fact, I 
gave the research team explicit instructions to downplay the role of top 
executives so that we could avoid the simplistic "credit the leader " or 
"blame the leader " thinking common today. 
To use an analogy, the "Leadership is the answer to everything7' perspec - 
tive is the modern equivalent of the "God is the answer to everything " per- 
spective that held back our scientific understanding of the physical world 
in the Dark Ages. In the 1500s, people ascribed all events they didn't 
understand to God. Why did the crops fail? God did it. Why did we have 
an earthquake? God did it. What holds the planets in place? God. But with 
======================================== [Página 22] ========================================

22 Jim Collins 
the Enlightenment, we began the search for a more scientific understand - 
ing-physics, chemistry, biology, and so forth. Not that we became athe- 
ists, but we gained deeper understanding about how the universe ticks. 
Similarly, every time we attribute everything to "Leadership, " we're no 
different from people in the 1500s. We're simply admitting our ignorance. 
Not that we should become leadership atheists (leadership does matter), 
but every time we throw our hands up in frustration -reverting back to 
"Well, the answer must be Leadership! "-we prevent ourselves from gain- 
ing deeper, more scientific understanding about what makes great com- 
panies tick. 
So, early in the project, I kept insisting, "Ignore the executives. " But the 
research team kept pushing back, "No! There is something consistently 
unusual about them. We can't ignore them. " And I'd respond, "But the 
comparison companies also had leaders, even some great leaders. So, 
what's different? " Back and forth the debate raged. 
Finally-as should always be the case-the data won. 
The good -to-great executives were all cut from the same cloth. It didn't 
matter whether the company was consumer or industrial, in crisis or 
steady state, offered services or products. It didn't matter when the transi - 
tion took place or how big the company. All the good -to-great companies 
had Level 5 leadership at the time of transition. Furthermore, the absence 
of Level 5 leadership showed up as a consistent pattern in the comparison 
companies. Given that Level 5 leadership cuts against the grain of con- 
ventional wisdom, especially the belief that we need larger -than-life sav- 
iors with big personalities to transform companies, it is important to note 
that Level 5 is an empirical finding, not an ideological one. 
HUMILITY + WILL = LEVEL 5 
Level 5 leaders are a study in duality: modest and willful, humble and 
fearless. To quickly grasp this concept, think of United States President 
Abraham Lincoln (one of the few Level 5 presidents in United States his - 
tory), who never let his ego get in the way of his primary ambition for the 
larger cause of an enduring great nation. Yet those who mistook Mr. Lin- 
coln's personal modesty, shy nature, and awkward manner as signs of 
weakness found themselves terribly mistaken, to the scale of 250,000 Con- 
federate and 360,000 Union lives, including Lincoln's own.14 
======================================== [Página 23] ========================================

Good to Great 23 
While it might be a bit of a stretch to compare the good -to-great CEOs 
to Abraham Lincoln, they did display the same duality. Consider the case 
of Colman Mockler, CEO of Gillette from 1975 to 1991. During Mock- 
ler7s tenure, Gillette faced three attacks that threatened to destroy the 
company's opportunity for greatness. Two attacks came as hostile takeover 
bids from Revlon, led by Ronald Perelman, a cigar -chomping raider with 
a reputation for breaking apart companies to pay down junk bonds and 
finance more hostile raids.15 The third attack came from Coniston Part- 
ners, an investment group that bought 5.9 percent of Gillette stock and 
initiated a proxy battle to seize control of the board, hoping to sell the 
company to the highest bidder and pocket a quick gain on their shared6 
Had Gillette been flipped to Perelman at the price he offered, shareown- 
ers would have reaped an instantaneous 44 percent gain on their stock." 
Looking at a $2.3 billion short -term stock profit across 116 million shares, 
most executives would have capitulated, pocketing millions from fli pping 
their own stock and cashing in on generous golden parachutes.18 
Colman Mockler did not capitulate, choosing instead to fight for the 
future greatness of Gillette, even though he himself would have pocketed 
a substantial sum on his own shares. A quiet and reserved man, always 
courteous, Mockler had the reputation of a gracious, almost patrician gen - 
tleman. Yet those who mistook Mockler's reserved nature for weakness 
found themselves beaten in the end. In the proxy fight, senior Gillette 
executives reached out to thousands of individual investors -person by 
person, phone call by phone call-and won the battle. 
Now, you might be thinking, "But that just sounds like self-serving 
entrenched management fighting for their interests at the expense of 
shareholder interests. " On the surface, it might look that way, but consider 
two key facts. 
First, Mockler and his team staked the company's future on huge invest - 
ments in radically new and technologicall y advanced systems (later known 
as Sensor and Mach3). Had the takeover been successful, these projects 
would almost certainly have been curtailed or eliminated, and none of us 
would be shaving with Sensor, Sensor for Women, or the Mach3-leaving 
hundreds of millions of people to a more painful daily battle with stubble.I9 
Second, at the time of the takeover battle, Sensor promised significant 
future profits that were not reflected in the stock price because it was in 
secret development. With Sensor in mind, the board and Mockler 
believed that the future value of the shares far exceeded the current price,

even with the price premium offered by the raiders. To sell out would 
have made short -term shareflippers happy but would have been utterly 
irresponsible to long-term shareholders. 
In the end, Mockler and the board were proved right, stunningly so. If a 
shareflipper had accepted the 44 percent price premium offered by 
Ronald Perelman on October 31, 1986, and then invested the full amount 
in the general market for ten years, through the end of 1996, he would 
have come out three times worse off than a shareholder who had stayed 
with Mockler and 
Gillette.20 Indeed, the company, its customers, and the 
shareholders would have been ill served had Mockler capitulated to the 
raiders, pocketed his millions, and retired to a life of leisure. 
Sadly, Mockler was never able to enjoy the full fruits of his effort. On 
January 25, 1991, the Gillette team received an advance copy of the cover 
of Forbes magazine, which featured an artist's rendition of Mockler stand - 
ing atop a mountain holding a giant razor above his head in a triumphal 
pose, while the vanquished languish on the hillsides below. The other 
======================================== [Página 25] ========================================

executives razzed the publicity -shy Mockler, who had likely declined 
requests to be photographed for the cover in the first place, amused at see- 
ing him portrayed as a corporate version of Conan the Triumphant. Walk - 
ing back to his office, minutes after seeing this public acknowledgment of 
his sixteen years of struggle, Mockler crumpled to the floor, struck dead by 
a massive heart 
 attack.21 
I do not know whether Mockler would have chosen to die in harness, 
but I am quite confident that he would not have changed his approach as 
chief executive. His placid persona hid an inner intensity, a dedication to 
making anything he touched the best it could possibly be-not just 
because of what he would get, but because he simply couldn't imagine 
doing it any other way. It wouldn't have been an option within Colman 
Mockler's value system to take the easy path and turn the company over to 
those who would milk it like a cow, destroying its potential to become 
great, any more than it would have been an option for Lincoln to sue for 
peace and lose forever the chance of an enduring great nation. 
Ambition for the Company: Setting Up Successors 
for Success 
When David Maxwell became CEO of Fannie Mae in 1981, the company 
was losing $1 million every single business day. Over the next nine years, 
Maxwell transformed Fannie Mae into a high -performance culture that 
rivaled the best Wall Street firms, earning $4 million every business day 
and beating the general stock market 3.8 to 1. Maxwell retired while still at 
the top of his game, feeling that the company would be ill served if he 
stayed on too long, and turned the company over to an equally capable suc- 
cessor, Jim Johnson. Shortly thereafter, Maxwell's retirement package, 
which had grown to be worth $20 million based on Fannie Mae's spectac - 
ular performance, became a point of controversy in Congress (Fannie Mae 
operates under a government charter). Maxwell responded by writing a let- 
ter to his successor, in which he expressed concern that the controversy 
would trigger an adverse reaction in Washington that could jeopardize the 
future of the company. He then instructed Johnson not to pay him the 
remaining balance-$5.5 million-and asked that the entire amount be 
contributed to the Fannie Mae foundation for low-income 
 housing.22 
David Maxwell, like Darwin Smith and Colman Mockler, exemplified a 
key trait of Level 5 leaders: ambition first and foremost for the company 
and concern for its success rather than for one's own riches and personal 
======================================== [Página 26] ========================================

26 Jim Collins 
renown. Level 5 leaders want to see the company even more successful in 
the next generation, comfortable with the idea that most people won't even 
know that the roots of that success trace back to their efforts. As one Level 5 
leader said, "I want to look out from my porch at one of the great compa - 
nies in the world someday and be able to say, 'I used to work there.' " 
In contrast, the comparison leaders, concerned more with their own 
reputation for personal greatness, often failed to set the company up for 
success in the next generation. After all, what better testament to your own 
personal greatness than that the place falls apart after you leave? 
In over three quarters of the comparison companies, we found execu - 
tives who set their successors up for failure or chose weak succes - 
sors, or both. 
Some had the "biggest dog " syndrome- they didn't mind other dogs in 
the kennel, as long as they remained the biggest one. One comparison 
CEO was said to have treated successor candidates "the way Henry the 
VIII treated 
 wives."23 
Consider the case of Rubbermaid, an unsustained comparison com - 
pany that grew from obscurity to number one on Forfune's annual list of 
America's Most Admired Companies and then, just as quickl y, disinte - 
grated into such sorry shape that it had to be acquired by Newell to save 
itself. The architect of this remarkable story, a charismatic and brilliant 
leader named Stanley Gault, became synonymous in the late 1980s with 
the success of the company. In 3 12 articles collected on Rubbermaid, 
Gault comes through as a hard -driving, egocentric executive. In one 
article, he responds to the accusation of being a tyrant with the state- 
ment, "Yes, but I'm a sincere 
 tyrant."24 In another, drawn directly from 
his own comments on leading change, the word I appears forty -four times 
("I could lead the charge "; "I wrote the twelve objectives "; "I presented 
and explained the objectives "), whereas the word we appears just sixteen 
times.25 Gault had every reason to be proud of his executive success. 
Rubbermaid generated forty consecutive quarters of earnings growth 
under his leadership -an impressive performance, and one that deserves 
respect. 
But-and this is the key point-Gault did not leave behind a company 
that would be great without him. His chosen successor lasted only one 
======================================== [Página 27] ========================================

Good to Great 27 
year on the job and the next in line faced a management team so shallow 
that he had to temporarily shoulder four jobs while scrambling to identify 
a new number two 
exe~utive.~~ Gault's successors found themselves strug - 
gling not only with a management void, but also with strategic voids that 
would eventually bring the company to its 
knees.27 
Of course, you might say, "Yes, Rubbermaid fell apart after Gault, but 
that just proves his personal greatness as a leader. " Exactly! Gault was 
indeed a tremendous Level 4 leader, perhaps one of the best in the last 
fifty years. But he was not a Level 5 leader, and that is one key reason why 
Rubbermaid went from good to great for a brief shining moment and 
then, just as quickly, went from great to irrelevant. 
A Compelling Modesty 
In contrast to the very I-centric style of the comparison leaders, we were 
struck by how the good -to-great leaders didn't talk about themselves. Dur- 
ing interviews with the good -to-great leaders, they'd talk about the com- 
pany and the contributions of other executives as long as we'd like but 
would deflect discussion about their own contributions. When pressed to 
talk about themselves, they'd say things like, "I hope I'm not sounding like 
a big shot. " Or, "If the board hadn't picked such great successors, you 
probably wouldn't be talking with me today. " Or, "Did I have a lot to do 
with it? Oh, that sounds so self -serving. I don't think I can take much 
credit. We were blessed with marvelous people. " Or, "There are plenty of 
people in this company who could do my job better than I do." 
It wasn't just false modesty. Those who worked with or wrote about the 
good -to-great leaders continually used words like quiet, humble, modest, 
reserved, shy, gracious, mild -mannered, self-effacing, understated, did not 
believe his own clippings; and so forth. Board member Jim Hlavacek 
described Ken Iverson, the CEO who oversaw Nucor's transformation 
from near bankruptcy to one of the most successful steel companies in the 
world: 
Ken is a very modest and humble man. I've never known a person as suc- 
cessful in doing what he's done that's as modest. And, I work for a lot of 
CEOs of large companies. And that's true in his private life as well. The 
simplicit y of him. I mean little things like he always gets his dogs at the 
local pound. He has a simple house that's he's lived in for ages. He only 
has a carport and he complained to me one day about how he had to use 
======================================== [Página 28] ========================================

28 Jim Collins 
his credit card to scrape the frost off his windows and he broke the credit 
card. "You know, Ken, there's a solution for it; enclose your carport. " 
And he said, "Ah, heck, it isn't that big of a deal. . . ." He's that humble 
and 
simple.28 
The eleven good -to-great CEOs are some of the most remarkable 
CEOs of the century, given that only eleven companies from the Fortune 
500 met the exacting standards for entry into this study. Yet, despite their 
remarkable results, almost no one ever remarked about them! George 
Cain, Alan Wurtzel, David Maxwell, Colman Mockler, Darwin Smith, 
Jim Herring, Lyle Everingham, Joe Cullman, Fred Allen, Cork Walgreen, 
Carl Reichardt -how many of these extraordinary executives had you 
heard of? 
The good -to-great leaders never wanted to become larger -than-life 
heroes. They never aspired to be put on a pedestal or become unreach- 
able icons. They were seemingly ordinary people quietly producing extra - 
ordinary results. 
Some of the comparison leaders provide a striking contrast. Scott Paper, 
the comparison company to Kimberl y-Clark, hired a CEO named Al 
Dunlap, a man cut from a very different cloth than Darwin Smith. Dun- 
lap loudly beat on his own chest, telling anyone who would listen (and 
many who would prefer not to) about what he had accomplished. Quoted 
in Business Week about his nineteen months atop Scott Paper, he boasted, 
"The Scott story will go down in the annals of American business history 
as one of the most successful, quickest turnarounds ever, [making] other 
turnarounds pale by 
compari~on."~~ 
According to Business Week, Dunlap personall y accrued $100 million 
for 603 days of work at Scott Paper (that's $165,000 per day), largely by 
slashing the workforce, cutting the R&D budget in half, and putting the 
company on growth steroids in preparation for sale.31 After selling off the 
======================================== [Página 29] ========================================

Good to Great 29 
company and pocketing his quick millions, Dunlap wrote a book about 
himself, in which he trumpeted his nickname Rambo in Pinstripes. "I 
love the Rambo movies, " he wrote. "Here's a guy who has zero chance of 
success and always wins. Rambo goes into situations against all odds, 
expecting to get his brains blown out. But he doesn't. At the end of the day 
he succeeds, he gets rid of the bad guys. He creates peace out of war. 
That's what I do, 
too."32 Darwin Smith may have enjoyed the mindless 
Rambo movies as well, but I suspect he never walked out of a theater and 
said to his wife, "You know, I really relate to this Rambo character; he 
reminds me of me." 
We found this pattern particularly strong in the unsustained compar - 
isons-cases where the company would show a leap in performance 
under a talented yet egocentric leader, only to decline in later years. Lee 
Iacocca, for example, saved Chrysler from the brink of catastrophe, per- 
forming one of the most celebrated (and deservedly so) turnarounds in 
American business history. Chrysler rose to a height of 2.9 times the mar- 
ket at a point about halfway through his tenure. Then, however, he 
diverted his attention to making himself one of the most celebrated CEOs 
in American business history. Investor's Business Daily and the Wall Street 
Journal chronicled how Iacocca appeared regularly on talk shows like the 
Today show and Larry King Live, personally starred in over eighty com- 
mercials, entertained the idea of running for president of the United 
States (quoted at one point, "Running Chrysler has been a bigger job than 
running the country. . . . I could handle the national economy in six 
months "), and widely promoted his autobiography. The book, lacocca, 
sold seven million copies and elevated him to rock star status, leading him 
to be mobbed by thousands of cheering fans upon his arrival in 
Japan.34 
Iacocca's personal stock soared, but in the second half of his tenure, 
Chrysler's stock fell 3 1 percent behind the general market. 
Sadly, Iacocca had trouble leaving center stage and letting go of the 
perks of executive kingship. He postponed his retirement so many times 
======================================== [Página 30] ========================================

30 Jim Collins 
that insiders at Chrysler began to joke that Iacocca stood for "I Am Chair - 
man of Chrysler Corporation 
 Always."35 And when he did finally retire, he 
demanded that the board continue to provide a private jet and stock 
options.36 Later, he joined forces with noted takeover artist Kirk Kerkorian 
to launch a hostile takeover bid for 
Chry~ler.~~ 
Chrysler experienced a brief return to glor y in the five years after 
Iacocca's retirement, but the company's underl ying weaknesses eventu - 
ally led to a buyout by German carmaker 
 Daimler-Ben~.~~ Certainly, the 
demise of Chrysler as a stand -alone company does not rest entirely on 
Iacocca's shoulders (the next generation of management made the fateful 
decision to sell the company to the Germans), but the fact remains: 
Iacocca7s brilliant turnaround in the early 1980s did not prove to be sus- 
tained and Chrysler failed to become an enduring great company. 
Unwavering Resolve. . . to Do What Must Be Done 
It is very important to grasp that Level 5 leadership is not just about 
humility and modesty. It is equall y about ferocious resolve, an almost 
stoic determination to do whatever needs to be done to make the com- 
pany great. 
Indeed, we debated for a long time on the research team about how to 
describe the good -to-great leaders. Initiall y, we penciled in terms like 
"selfless executive7' and "servant leader. " But members of the team vio- 
lently objected to these characterizations. 
"Those labels don't ring true, " said Anthony Chirikos. "It makes them 
sound weak or meek, but that's not at all the way I think of Darwin Smith 
or Colman Mockler. They would do almost anything to make the com- 
pany great." 
Then Eve Li suggested, "Why don't we just call them Level 5 leaders? 
If we put a label like 'selfless' or 'servant' on them, people will get entirely 
the wrong idea. We need to get people to engage with the whole concept, 
to see both sides of the coin. If you only get the humility side, you miss the 
whole idea. " 
Level 5 leaders are fanatically driven, infected with an incurable need 
to produce results. They will sell the mills or fire their brother, if that's 
what it takes to make the company great. 
When George Cain became CEO of Abbott Laboratories, it sat in the 
bottom quartile of the pharmaceutical industry, a drowsy enterprise that 
======================================== [Página 31] ========================================

Good to Great 31 
had lived for years off its cash cow, erythromycin. Cain didn't have an 
inspiring personality to galvanize the company, but he had something 
much more powerful: inspired standards. He could not stand mediocrity 
in any form and was utterly intolerant of anyone who would accept the 
idea that good is good enough. Cain then set out to destroy one of the key 
causes of Abbott's mediocrity: nepotism. Systematically rebuilding both 
the board and the executive team with the best people he could find, Cain 
made it clear that neither family ties nor length of tenure would have any- 
thing to do with whether you held a key position in the company. If you 
didn't have the capacity to become the best executive in the industry in 
your span of responsibility, then you would lose your 
 paycheck.39 
Such rigorous rebuilding might be expected from an outsider 
brought in to turn the company around, but Cain was an eighteen -year 
veteran insider and a family member, the son of a previous Abbott pres- 
ident. Holiday gatherings were probably tense for a few years in the 
Cain clan. ("Sorry I had to fire you. Want another slice of turkey? ") In 
the end, though, family members were quite pleased with the perfor - 
mance of their stock, for Cain set in motion a profitable growth 
machine that, from its transition date in 1974 to 2000, created share - 
holder returns that beat the market 4.5 to 1, handily outperforming indus - 
try superstars Merck and Pfizer. 
Upjohn, the direct comparison company to Abbott, also had family 
leadership during the same era as George Cain. Unlike George Cain, 
Upjohn's CEO never showed the same resolve to break the mediocrity of 
nepotism. By the time Abbott had filled all key seats with the best people, 
regardless of family background, Upjohn still had B level famil y members 
holding key 
positions.40 Virtually identical companies with identical stock 
charts up to the point of transition, Upjohn then fell 89 percent behind 
Abbott over the next twenty -one years before capitulating in a merger to 
Pharmacia in 1995. 
As an interesting aside, Darwin Smith, Colman Mockler, and George 
Cain came from inside the company. Stanley Gault, Al Dunlap, and Lee 
Iacocca rode in as saviors from the outside, trumpets blaring. This reflects 
a more systematic finding from our study. The evidence does not support 
the idea that you need an outside leader to come in and shake up the 
place to go from good to great. In fact, going for a high -profile outside 
change agent is negatively correlated with a sustained transformation from 
good to great. (See Appendix 2.A.) 
======================================== [Página 32] ========================================

32 Jim Collins 
A superb example of insider -driven change comes from Charles R. 
"Cork" Walgreen 3d, who transformed dowdy Walgreens into a company 
that outperformed the stock market by over fifteen times from the end of 
1975 to January 1, 
2000.42 After years of dialogue and debate within his 
executive team about Walgreens' food-service operations, Cork sensed 
that the team had finally reached a watershed point of clarity and under - 
standing: Walgreens' brightest future lay in convenient drugstores, not 
food service. Dan Jorndt, who succeeded Walgreen as CEO in 1998, 
described what happened next: 
Cork said at one of our planning committee meetings, "Okay, now I am 
going to draw the line in the sand. We are going to be out of the restau - 
rant business completely in five years. " At the time, we had over five 
hundred restaurants. You could have heard a pin drop. He said, "I want 
to let everybody know the clock is ticking. . . ." Six months later, we were 
at our next planning committee meeting and someone mentioned just 
in passing that we only had five years to be out of the restaurant business. 
Cork was not a real vociferous fellow. He sort of tapped on the table and 
said, "Listen, you have four and a half years. I said you had five years six 
months ago. Now you've got four and a half years. " Well, that next day, 
things really clicked into gear to winding down our restaurant business. 
He never wavered. He never doubted; he never second-guessed.43 
Like Darwin Smith selling the mills at Kimberl y-Clark, Cork Wal- 
green's decision required stoic resolve. Not that food service was the 
largest part of the business (although it did add substantial profits to the 
bottom line). The real problem was more emotional. Walgreens had, after 
all, invented the malted milkshake and food service was a long -standing 
family tradition dating back to his grandfather. Some food-service outlets 
were even named after the CEO himself-a restaurant chain named 
Corky's. But no matter, if Walgreens had to fly in the face of long-standing 
family tradition in order to focus its resources where it could be the best in 
======================================== [Página 33] ========================================

Good to Great 33 
the world (convenient drugstores), Cork would do it. Quietly, doggedly, 
simply.44 
The quiet, dogged nature of Level 5 leaders showed up not only in big 
decisions, like selling off the food-service operations or fighting corpo - 
rate raiders, but also in a personal style of sheer workmanlike diligence. 
Alan Wurtzel, a second -generation family member who took over his 
family's small company and turned it into Circuit City, perfectly cap- 
tured the gestalt of this trait. When asked about differences between 
himself and his counterpart CEO at Circuit City's comparison company, 
Wurtzel summed up: "The show horse and the plow horse-he was more 
of a show horse, whereas I was more of a plow 
 horse."45 
The Window and the Mirror 
Alan Wurtzel's plow horse comment is fascinating in light of two other 
facts. First, he holds a doctor of jurisprudence degree from Yale-clearly, 
his plow horse nature had nothing to do with a lack of intelligence. Sec- 
ond, his plow horse approach set the stage for truly best in show results. Let 
me put it this way: If you had to choose between $1 invested in Circuit 
City or $1 invested in General Electric on the day that the legendary Jack 
Welch took over GE in 1981 and held to January 1,2000, you would have 
been better off with Circuit City-by six 
times.46 Not a bad performance, 
for a plow horse. 
You might expect that extraordinary results like these would lead Alan 
Wurtzel to discuss the brilliant decisions he made. But when we asked 
him to list the top five factors in his company's transformation, ranked by 
importance, Wurtzel gave a surprising answer: The number one factor 
was luck. "We were in a great industry, with the wind at our backs. " 
We pushed back, pointing out that we selected the good-to-great com- 
panies based on performance that surpassed their industry's average. Fur- 
thermore, the comparison company (Silo) was in the same industry, with 
the same wind and probably bigger sails! We debated the point for a few 
minutes, with Wurtzel continuing his preference for attributing much of 
his success to just being in the right place at the right time. Later, when 
asked to discuss the factors behind the enduring nature of the transforma - 
tion, he said, "The first thing that comes to mind is luck. . . . I was lucky to 
find the right 
 succe~sor."~' 
Luck. What an odd factor to talk about. Yet the good -to-great execu - 
tives talked a lot about luck in our interviews. In one interview with a 
======================================== [Página 34] ========================================

34 Jim Collins 
Nucor executive, we asked why the company had such a remarkable 
track record of good decisions; he responded: "I guess we were just 
Joseph F. Cullman 3d, the Level 5 transition CEO of Philip 
Morris, flat -out refused to take credit for his company's success, attribut - 
ing his good fortune to having great colleagues, successors, and predeces - 
sor~.~~ Even the book he wrote-a book he undertook at the urging of his 
colleagues, which he never intended to distribute widely outside the 
company -had the unusual title I'm a Lucky Guy. The opening para- 
graph reads: "I was a very lucky guy from the very beginning of my life: 
marvelous parents, good genes, lucky in love, lucky in business, and 
lucky when a Yale classmate had my orders changed to report to Wash - 
ington, D.C., in early 1941, instead of to a ship that was sunk with all 
hands lost in the North Atlantic, luck y to be in the Navy, and lucky to be 
alive at 
eightyfi~e."~~ 
We were at first puzzled by this emphasis on good luck. After all, we 
found no evidence that the good -to-great companies were blessed with 
more good luck (or more bad luck, for that matter) than the comparison 
companies. Then we began to notice a contrasting pattern in the compar - 
ison executives: They credited substantial blame to bad luck, frequentl y 
bemoaning the difficulties of the environment they faced. 
Compare Bethlehem Steel to Nucor. Both companies operated in the 
steel industry and produced hard-to-differentiate products. Both compa - 
nies faced the competitive challenge of cheap imported steel. Yet execu - 
tives at the two companies had completely different views of the same 
environment. Bethlehem Steel's CEO summed up the company's prob- 
lems in 1983 by blaming imports: "Our first, second, and third problems 
are 
imports."51 Ken Iverson and his crew at Nucor considered the same 
challenge from imports a blessing, a stroke of good fortune ("Aren't we 
lucky; steel is heavy, and they have to ship it all the way across the ocean, 
giving us a huge advantage! "). Iverson saw the first, second, and third 
problems facing the American steel industry not to be imports, but man- 
agernent5* He even went so far as to speak out publicly against govern - 
ment protection against imports, telling a stunned gathering of fellow 
steel executives in 1977 that the real problems facing the American steel 
industry lay in the fact that management had failed to keep pace with 
inn~vation.~~ 
The emphasis on luck turns out to be part of a pattern that we came to 
call the window and the mirror.

The comparison leaders did just the opposite. They'd look out the win- 
dow for something or someone outside themselves to blame for poor 
results, but would preen , in front of the mirror and credit themselves when 
things went well. Strangely, the window and the mirror do not reflect 
objective reality. Everyone outside the window points inside, directly at 
the Level 5 leader, saying, "He was the key; without his guidance and 
leadership, we would not have become a great company. " And the Level 5 
leader points right back out the window and says, "Look at all the great 
people and good fortune that made this possible; I'm a lucky guy." They're 
both right, of course. But the Level 5s would never admit that fact. 
CULTIVATING LEVEL 5 LEADERSHIP 
Not long ago, I shared the Level 5 finding with a gathering of senior exec- 
utives. A woman who had recently become chief executive of her com- 
pany raised her hand and said, "I believe what you say about the 
good -to-great leaders. But I'm disturbed because when I look in the mir- 
ror, I know that I'm not Level 5, not yet anyway. Part of the reason I got 
this job is because of my ego drives. Are you telling me that I can't make 
this a great company if I'm not Level 5?" 
"I don't know for certain that you absolutely must be a Level 5 leader to 
make your company great, " I replied. "I will simply point back to the data: 
Of 1,435 companies that appeared on the Fortune 500 in our initial can- 
didate list, only eleven made the very tough cut into our study. In those 
eleven, all of them had Level 5 leadership in key positions, including the 
CEO, at the pivotal time of transition. " 
She sat there, quiet for moment, and you could tell everyone in the 
room was mentally urging her to ask the question. Finally, she said, "Can 
you learn to become Level 5?"

My hypothesis is that there are two categories of people: those who do 
not have the seed of Level 5 and those who do. The first category consists 
of people who could never in a million years bring themselves to subju - 
gate their egoistic needs to the greater ambition of building something 
larger and more lasting than themselves. For these people, work will 
always be first and foremost about what they get -fame, fortune, adula - 
tion, power, whatever -not what they build, create, and contribute. 
======================================== [Página 37] ========================================

Good to Great 37 
that they need to hire a larger-than-life, egocentric leader to make an 
organization great, you can quickly see why Level 5 leaders rarely 
appear at the top of our institutions. 
The second category of people-and I suspect the larger group-con- 
sists of those who have the potential to evolve to Level 5; the capability 
resides within them, perhaps buried or ignored, but there nonetheless. 
And under the right circumstances -self-reflection, conscious personal 
development, a mentor, a great teacher, loving parents, a significant life 
experience, a Level 5 boss, or any number of other factors-they begin to 
develop. 
In looking at the data, we noticed that some of the leaders in our study 
had significant life experiences that might have sparked or furthered their 
maturation. Darwin Smith fully blossomed after his experience with can- 
cer. Joe Cullman was profoundly affected by his World War IIexperi - 
ences, particularly the last-minute change of orders that took him off a 
doomed ship on which he surely would have 
 died.54 A strong religious 
belief or conversion might also nurture development of Level 5 traits. Col- 
man Mockler, for example, converted to evangelical Christianity while 
getting his MBA at Harvard, and later, according to the book Cutting 
Edge, became a prime mover in a group of Boston business executives 
who met frequently over breakfast to discuss the carryover of religious val- 
ues to corporate life.55 Other leaders in our study, however, had no obvi- 
ous catalytic event; they just led normal lives and somehow ended up atop 
the Level 5 hierarchy. 
I believe -although I cannot prove-that potential Level 5 leaders are 
highl y prevalent in our society. The problem is not, in my estimation, a 
dearth of potential Level 5 leaders. They exist all around us, if we just know 
what to look for. And what is that? Look for situations where extraordinary 
results exist but where no individual steps forth to claim excess credit. You 
will likely find a potential Level 5 leader at work. 
For your own development, I would love to be able to give you a list of 
steps for becoming Level 5, but we have no solid research data that would 
support a credible list. Our research exposed Level 5 as a key component 
inside the black box of what it takes to shift a company from good to great. 
Yet inside that black box is yet another black box -namely, the inner 
development of a person to Level 5. We could speculate on what might be 
======================================== [Página 38] ========================================

38 Jim Collins 
inside that inner black box, but it would mostly be just that-speculation. 
So, in short, Level 5 is a very satisfying idea, a powerful idea, and, to pro - 
duce the best transitions from good to great, perhaps an essential idea. A 
"Ten-Step List to Level 5" would trivialize the concept. 
My best advice, based on the research, is to begin practicing the other 
good-to -great disciplines we discovered. We found a symbiotic relation - 
ship between Level 5 and the remaining findings. On the one hand, Level 
5 traits enable you to implement the other findings; on the other hand, 
practicing the other findings helps you to become Level 5. Think of it this 
way: This chapter is about what Level 5s are; the rest of the book describes 
what they do. Leading with the other disciplines can help you move in the 
right direction. There is no guarantee that doing so will turn you into a 
full-fledged Level 5, but it gives you a tangible place to begin. 
We cannot say for sure what percentage of people have the seed within, 
or how many of those can nurture it. Even those of us who discovered 
Level 5 on the research team do not know for ourselves whether we will 
succeed in fully evolving to Level 5. And yet, all of us who worked on the 
finding have been deeply affected and inspired by the idea. Darwin 
Smith, Colman Mockler, Alan Wurtzel, and all the other Level 5s we 
learned about have become models for us, something worthy to aspire 
toward. Whether or not we make it all the way to Level 5, it is worth the 
effort. For like all basic truths about what is best in human beings, when 
we catch a glimpse of that truth, we know that our own lives and all that 
we touch will be the better for the effort.

CHAPTER 3 
There are going to be times when we can't wait for somebody. 
Now, you're either on the bus or off the bus. 
-KEN KESEY, 
from The Electric Kool -Aid Acid Test 
by Tom Wolfe1 
en we began the research project, we expected to find that the 
first step in taking a company from good to great would be to set a new 
direction, a new vision and strategy for the company, and then to get peo- 
ple committed and aligned behind that new direction. 
We found something quite the opposite. 
The executives who ignited the transformations from good to great did 
not first figure out where to drive the bus and then get people to take it 
there. No, they first got the right people on the bus (and the wrong people 
off the bus) and then figured out where to drive it. They said, in essence, 
"Look, I don't really know where we should take this bus. But I know this 
much: If we get the right people on the bus, the right people in the right 
seats, and the wrong people off the bus, then we'll figure out how to take it 
someplace great. " 
======================================== [Página 42] ========================================

42 Jim Collins 
The good -to-great leaders understood three simple truths. First, if you 
begin with "who," rather than "what, " you can more easily adapt to a 
changing world. If people join the bus primarily because of where it is 
going, what happens if you get ten miles down the road and you need to 
change direction? You've got a problem. But if people are on the bus 
because of who else is on the bus, then it's much easier to change direc - 
tion: "Hey, I got on this bus because of who else is on it; if we need to 
change direction to be more successful, fine with me. " Second, if you 
have the right people on the bus, the problem of how to motivate and 
manage people largely goes away. The right people don't need to be 
tightly managed or fired up; they will be self-motivated by the inner drive 
to produce the best results and to be part of creating something great. 
Third, if you have the wrong people, it doesn't matter whether you dis - 
cover the right direction; you still won't have a great company. Great 
vision without great people is irrelevant. 
Consider the case of Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo began its fifteen -year 
stint of spectacular performance in 1983, but the foundation for the shift 
dates back to the early 1970s, when then -CEO Dick Cooley began build - 
ing one of the most talented management teams in the industry (the best 
team, according to investor Warren 
 B~ffett).~ Cooley foresaw that the 
banking industry would eventually undergo wrenching change, but he 
did not pretend to know what form that change would take. So instead of 
mapping out a strategy for change, he and chairman Ernie Arbuckle 
focused on "injecting an endless stream of talent " directly into the veins of 
the company. They hired outstanding people whenever and wherever 
they found them, often without any specific job in mind. "That's how you 
build the future, " he said. "If I'm not smart enough to see the changes that 
are coming, they will. And they'll be flexible enough to deal with 
 them."3 
Cooley's approach proved prescient. No one could predict all the changes 
that would be wrought by banking deregulation. Yet when these changes 
came, no bank handled those challenges better than Wells Fargo. At a time 
when its sector of the banking industry fell 59 percent behind the general 
stock market, Wells Fargo outperformed the market by over three times.4 
Carl Reichardt, who became CEO in 1983, attributed the bank's suc- 
cess largely to the people around him, most of whom he inherited from 
Cooley.5 As he listed members of the Wells Fargo executive team that had 
joined the company during the Cooley -Reichardt era, we were stunned. 
Nearly every person had gone on to become CEO of a major company: 
======================================== [Página 43] ========================================

Good to Great 43 
Bill Aldinger became the CEO of Household Finance, Jack Grundhofer 
became CEO of U.S. Bancorp, Frank Newman became CEO of Bankers 
Trust, Richard Rosenberg became CEO of Bank of America, Bob Joss 
became CEO of Westpac Banking (one of the largest banks in Australia) 
and later became dean of the Graduate School of Business at Stanford 
University -not exactly your garden variety executive team! Arjay Miller, 
an active Wells Fargo board member for seventeen years, told us that the 
Wells Fargo team reminded him of the famed "Whiz Kids" recruited to 
Ford Motor Company in the late 1940s (of which Miller was a member, 
eventually becoming president of Ford).6 Wells Fargo's approach was sim- 
ple: You get the best people, you build them into the best managers in the 
industr y, and you accept the fact that some of them will be recruited to 
become CEOs of other companies.' 
Bank of America took a very different approach. While Dick Cooley 
systematically recruited the best people he could get his hands on, Bank of 
America, according to the book Breaking the Bank, followed something 
called the "weak generals, strong lieutenants7' model.8 If you pick strong 
generals for key positions, their competitors will leave. But if you pick 
weak generals -placeholders, rather than highly capable executives - 
then the strong lieutenants are more likely to stick around. 
The weak generals model produced a climate very different at Bank of 
America than the one at Wells Fargo. Whereas the Wells Fargo crew acted 
as a strong team of equal partners, ferociously debating eyeball -to-eyeball 
in search of the best answers, the Bank of America weak generals would 
wait for directions from above. Sam Armacost, who inherited the weak 
generals model, described the management climate: "I came away quite 
distressed from my first couple of management meetings. Not only 
couldn't I get conflict, I couldn't even get comment. They were all wait- 
ing to see which way the wind blew."9 
A retired Bank of America executive described senior managers in the 
1970s as "Plastic People " who'd been trained to quietly submit to the dic- 
tates of a domineering CEO.1° Later, after losing over $1 billion in the mid- 
1980s, Bank of America recruited a gang of strong generals to turn the bank 
around. And where did it find those strong generals? From right across the 
street at Wells Fargo. In fact, Bank of America recruited so many Wells 
Fargo executives during its turnaround that people inside began to refer to 
themselves as "Wells of America. "" At that point, Bank of America began to 
climb upward again, but it was too little too late. From 1973 to 1998, while

Now, you might be thinking, "That's just good management -the idea 
of getting the right people around you. What's new about that?" On one 
level, we have to agree; it is just plain old-fashioned good management. 
But what stands out with such distinction in the good -to-great companies 
are two key points that made them quite different. 
"First who" is a very simple idea to grasp, and a very difficult idea to 
do-and most don't do it well. It's easy to talk about paying attention to 
======================================== [Página 45] ========================================

Good to Great 45 
people decisions, but how many executives have the discipline of David 
Maxwell, who held off on developing a strategy until he got the right peo - 
ple in place, while the company was losing $1 million every single business 
day with $56 billion of loans underwater? When Maxwell became CEO 
of Fannie Mae during its darkest days, the board desperately wanted to 
know how he was going to rescue the company. Despite the immense 
pressure to act, to do something dramatic, to seize the wheel and start dri - 
ving, Maxwell focused first on getting the right people on the Fannie Mae 
management team. His first act was to interview all the officers. He sat 
them down and said, "Look, this is going to be a very hard challenge. I 
want you to think about how demanding this is going to be. If you don't 
think you're going to like it, that's fine. Nobody's going to hate you."12 
Maxwell made it absolutely clear that there would only be seats for A 
players who were going to put forth an A+ effort, and if you weren't up for 
it, you had better get off the bus, and get off now.13 One executive who 
had just uprooted his life and career to join Fannie Mae came to Maxwell 
and said, "I listened to you very carefully, and I don't want to do this." He 
left and went back to where he came from.14 In all, fourteen of twenty -six 
executives left the company, replaced by some of the best, smartest, and 
hardest -working executives in the entire world of finance.I5 The same 
standard applied up and down the Fannie Mae ranks as managers at every 
level increased the caliber of their teams and put immense peer pressure 
upon each other, creating high turnover at first, when some people just 
didn't pan out.16 "We had a saying, 'You can't fake it at Fannie Mae,' " said 
one executive team member. "Either you knew your stuff or you didn't, 
and if you didn't, you'd just blow out of here."17 
Wells Fargo and Fannie Mae both illustrate the idea that "who" ques- 
tions come before "what" questions - before vision, before strategy, before 
tactics, before organizational structure, before technology. Dick Cooley 
and David Maxwell both exemplified a classic Level 5 style when they 
said, "I don't know where we should take this company, but I do know that 
if I start with the right people, ask them the right questions, and engage 
them in vigorous debate, we will find a way to make this company great. " 
NOT A "GENIUS WITH A THOUSAND HELPERS " 
In contrast to the good -to-great companies, which built deep and strong 
executive teams, many of the comparison companies followed a "genius 
======================================== [Página 46] ========================================

with a thousand helpers " model. In this model, the company is a platform 
for the talents of an extraordinary individual. In these cases, the towering 
genius, the primary driving force in the company's success, is a great asset- 
as long as the genius sticks around. The geniuses seldom build great man- 
agement teams, for the simple reason that they don't need one, and often 
don't want one. If you're a genius, you don't need a Wells Fargo -caliber 
management team of people who could run their own shows elsewhere. 
No, you just need an army of good soldiers who can help implement your 
great ideas. However, when the genius leaves, the helpers are often lost. Or, 
worse, they try to mimic their predecessor with bold, visionary moves (trying 
to act like a genius, without being a genius) that prove unsuccessful. 
Eckerd Corporation suffered the liability of a leader who had an 
uncanny genius for figuring out "what" to do but little ability to assemble 
the right "who" on the executive team. Jack Eckerd, blessed with monu - 
mental personal energy (he campaigned for governor of Florida while 
running his company) and a genetic gift for market insight and shrewd 
deal making, acquired his way from two little stores in Wilmington, 
Delaware, to a drugstore empire of over a thousand stores spread across 
the southeastern United States. By the late 1970s, Eckerd's revenues 
equaled Walgreens', and it looked like Eckerd might triumph as the great 
company in the industry. But then Jack Eckerd left to pursue his passion 
for politics, running for senator and joining the Ford administration in 
Washington. Without his guiding genius, Eckerd7s company began a long 
decline, eventually being acquired by J. C. Penney.18 
The contrast between Jack Eckerd and Cork Walgreen is striking. 
Whereas Jack Eckerd had a genius for picking the right stores to buy, 
Cork Walgreen had a genius for picking the right people to hire.19 
Whereas Jack Eckerd had a gift for seeing which stores should go in what 
locations, Cork Walgreen had a gift for seeing which people should go in 
what seats. Whereas Jack Eckerd failed utterly at the single most impor - 
tant decision facing any executive -the selection of a successor -Cork 
Walgreen developed multiple outstanding candidates and selected a 
superstar successor, who may prove to be even better than Cork him- 
self.20 Whereas Jack Eckerd had no executive team, but instead a bunch 
of capable helpers assembled to assist the great genius, Cork Walgreen 
built the best executive team in the industry. Whereas the primary guid - 
ance mechanism for Eckerd Corporation's strategy lay inside Jack Eck- 
erd's head, the primary guidance mechanism for Walgreens' corporate

strategy lay in the group dialogue and shared insights of the talented

The "genius with a thousand helpers " model is particularly prevalent in 
the unsustained comparison companies. The most classic case comes 
from a man known as the Sphinx, Henry Singleton of Teledyne. Single -

Ph.D. from MIT, he founded 
 Teledyne.21 The name Teledyne derives

central force holding the far-flung empire together was Henry Singleton 
himself. 
Through acquisitions, Singleton built the company from a small enter - 
prise to number 293 on the Fortune 500 list in six 
years.22 Within ten 
years, he'd completed more than 100 acquisitions, eventually creating a

himself acting as the glue that connected all the moving parts together. At 
one point, he said, "I define my job as having the freedom to do what 
seems to me to be in the best interest of the company at any 
 time."24 A 
1978 Forbes feature story maintained, "Singleton will win no awards for 
humility, but who can avoid standing in awe of his impressive record? " 
Singleton continued to run the company well into his seventies, with no 
serious thought given to succession. After all, why worry about succession 
when the very point of the whole thing is to serve as a platform to leverage 
the talents of your remarkable genius? "If there is a single weakness in this 
otherwise brilliant picture, " the article continued, "it is this: Teledyne is 
not so much a system as it is the reflection of one man's singular disci- 
 line."^^ 
What a weakness it turned out to be. Once Singleton stepped away 
from day-to-day management in the mid-1980s, the far-flung empire 
began to crumble. From the end of 1986 until its merger with Allegheny 
in 1995, Teledyne's cumulative stock returns imploded, falling 66 percent 
behind the general stock market. Singleton achieved his childhood dream 
of becoming a great businessman, but he failed utterly at the task of build - 
ing a great company.

IT'S WHO YOU PAY, NOT HOW YOU PAY THEM 
We expected to find that changes in incentive systems, especially execu - 
tive incentives, would be highly correlated with making the leap from 
good to great. With all the attention paid to executive compensation -the 
shift to stock options and the huge packages that have become common - 
place-surely, we thought, the amount and structure of compensation 
must play a key role in going from good to great. How else do you get peo - 
ple to do the right things that create great results? 
We were dead wrong in our expectations. 
We spent weeks inputting compensation data from proxy statements 
and performed 112 separate analyses looking for patterns and correla - 
tions. We examined everything we could quantify for the top five offi - 
cers-cash versus stock, long-term versus short -term incentives, salary 
versus bonus, and so forth. Some companies used stock extensively; oth- 
ers didn't. Some had high salaries; others didn't. Some made significant 
use of bonus incentives; others didn't. Most importantly, when we ana- 
lyzed executive compensation patterns relative to comparison companies, 
we found no systematic differences on the use of stock (or not), high 
salaries (or not), bonus incentives (or not), or long-term compensation 
(or not). The only significant difference we found was that the good -to- 
great executives received slightly less total cash compensation ten years 
after the transition than their counterparts at the still-mediocre compari - 
son 
companies!26 
Not that executive compensation is irrelevant. You have to be basically 
rational and reasonable (I doubt that Colman Mockler, David Maxwell, or 
Darwin Smith would have worked for free), and the good -to-great compa - 
nies did spend time thinking about the issue. But once you've structured 
something that makes basic sense, executive compensation falls away as a 
distinguishing variable in moving an organization from good to great. 
======================================== [Página 50] ========================================

50 Jim Collins 
Why might that be? It is simply a manifestation of the "first who" prin- 
ciple: It's not how you compensate your executives, it's which executives you 
have to compensate in the first place. If you have the right executives on 
the bus, they will do everything within their power to build a great com- 
pany, not because of what they will "get" for it, but because they simply 
cannot imagine settling for anything less. Their moral code requires 
building excellence for its own sake, and you're no more likely to change 
that with a compensation package than you're likely to affect whether they 
breathe. The good -to-great companies understood a simple truth: The 
right people will do the right things and deliver the best results they're 
capable of, regardless of the incentive system. 
We were not able to look as rigorously at nonexecutive compensation; 
such data is not available in as systematic a format as proxy statements for 
top officers. Nonetheless, evidence from source documents and articles 
suggests that the same idea applies at all levels of an 
organi~ation.~~ 
A particularly vivid example is Nucor. Nucor built its entire system on 
the idea that you can teach farmers how to make steel, but you can't teach 
a farmer work ethic to people who don't have it in the first place. So, 
instead of setting up mills in traditional steel towns like Pittsburgh and 
Gary, it located its plants in places like Crawfordsville, Indiana; Norfolk, 
Nebraska; and Plymouth, Utah -places full of real farmers who go to bed 
early, rise at dawn, and get right to work without fanfare. "Gotta milk the 
cows" and "Gonna plow the north forty before noon" translated easily into 
"Gotta roll some sheet steel" and "Gonna cast forty tons before lunch. " 
Nucor ejected people who did not share this work ethic, generating as 
high as 50 percent turnover in the first year of a plant, followed by very low 
turnover as the right people settled in for the long 
To attract and keep the best workers, Nucor paid its steelworkers more 
than any other steel company in the world. But it built its pay system 
around a high -pressure team -bonus mechanism, with over 50 percent of a 
======================================== [Página 51] ========================================

Good to Great 51
worker's compensation tied directl y to the productivity of his work team of 
twenty to forty 
 people.29 Nucor team members would usually show up for 
work thirty minutes early to arrange their tools and prepare to blast off the 
starting line the instant the shift gun 
fired.30 "We have the hardest working 
steel workers in the world, " said one Nucor executive. "We hire five, work 
them like ten, and pay them like 
eight."31 
The Nucor system did not aim to turn lazy people into hard workers, 
but to create an environment where hardworking people would thrive and 
lazy workers would either jump or get thrown right off the bus. In one 
extreme case, workers chased a lazy teammate right out of the plant with 
an angle iron.j2 
Nucor rejected the old adage that people are your most important 
asset. In a good -to-great transformation, people are not your most 
important asset. The right people are. 
Nucor illustrates a key point. In determining "the right people, " the 
good -to-great companies placed greater weight on character attributes 
than on specific educational background, practical skills, specialized 
knowledge, or work experience. Not that specific knowledge or skills are 
unimportant, but they viewed these traits as more teachable (or at least 
learnable), whereas they believed dimensions like character, work ethic, 
basic intelligence, dedication to fulfilling commitments, and values are 
more ingrained. As Dave Nassef of Pitney Bowes put it: 
I used to be in the Marines, and the Marines get a lot of credit for build - 
ing people's values. But that's not the way it really works. The Marine 
Corps recruits people who share the corps' values, then provides them 
with the training required to accomplish the organization's mission. We 
look at it the same way at Pitney Bowes. We have more people who want 
to do the right thing than most companies. We don't just look at experi - 
ence. We want to know: Who are they? Why are they? We find out who 
they are by asking them why they made decisions in their life. The 
answers to these questions give us insight into their core 
 values.33 
One good -to-great executive said that his best hiring decisions often 
came from people with no industry or business experience. In one case, 
======================================== [Página 52] ========================================

52 Jim Collins 
he hired a manager who'd been captured twice during the Second World 
War and escaped both times. "I thought that anyone who could do that 
shouldn't have trouble with 
 business."34 
RIGOROUS, NOT RUTHLESS 
The good -to-great companies probably sound like tough places to work- 
and they are. If you don't have what it takes, you probably won't last long. 
But they're not ruthless cultures, they're rigorous cultures. And the dis- 
tinction is crucial. 
To be ruthless means hacking and cutting, especially in difficult times, 
or wantonly firing people without any thoughtful consideration. To be rig- 
orous means consistently applying exacting standards at all times and at all 
levels, especially in upper management. To be rigorous, not ruthless, 
means that the best people need not worry about their positions and can 
concentrate fully on their work. 
In 1986, Wells Fargo acquired Crocker Bank and planned to shed gobs 
of excess cost in the consolidation. There's nothing unusual about that- 
every bank merger in the era of deregulation aimed to cut excess cost out 
of a bloated and protected industry. However, what was unusual about the 
Wells -Crocker consolidation is the way Wells integrated management or, 
to be more accurate, the way it didn't even try to integrate most Crocker 
management into the Wells culture. 
The Wells Fargo team concluded right up front that the vast majority of 
Crocker managers would be the wrong people on the bus. Crocker people 
had long been steeped in the traditions and perks of old-style banker cul - 
ture, complete with a marbled executive dining room with its own chef 
and $500,000 worth of china.j5 Quite a contrast to the spartan culture at      /- 
Wells Fargo, where management ate food prepared by a college dormitory 
food 
 service.36 Wells Fargo made it clear to the Crocker managers: "Look, 
this is not a merger of equals; it's an acquisition; we bought your branches 
and your customers; we didn't acquire you." Wells Fargo terminated most 
of the Crocker management team - 1,600 Crocker managers gone on day 
one- including nearly all the top  executive^.^' 
A critic might say, "That's just the Wells people protecting their own." 
But consider the following fact: Wells Fargo also sent some of its own 
managers packing in cases where the Crocker managers were judged as 
better qualified. When it came to management, the Wells Fargo stan- 
======================================== [Página 53] ========================================

Good to Great 53 
dards were ferocious and consistent. Like a professional sports team, only 
the best made the annual cut, regardless of position or tenure. Summed 
up one Wells Fargo executive: "The only way to deliver to the people 
who are achieving is to not burden them with the people who are not 
achie~ing."~~ 
On the surface, this looks ruthless. But the evidence suggests that the 
average Crocker manager was just not the same caliber as the average 
Wells manager and would have failed in the Wells Fargo performance 
culture. If they weren't going to make it on the bus in the long term, why 
let them suffer in the short term? One senior Wells Fargo executive told 
us: "We all agreed this was an acquisition, not a merger, and there's no 
sense beating around the bush, not being straightforward with people. We 
decided it would be best to simply do it on day one. We planned our 
efforts so that we could say, right up front, 'Sorry, we don't see a role for 
you,' or 'Yes, we do see a role; you have a job, so stop worrying about it.' 
We were not going to subject our culture to a death by a thousand 
cuts.' "j9 
To let people languish in uncertainty for months or years, stealing pre - 
cious time in their lives that they could use to move on to something else, 
when in the end they aren't going to make it anyway -that would be ruth- 
less. To deal with it right up front and let people get on with their lives- 
that is rigorous. 
Not that the Crocker acquisition is easy to swallow. It's never pleasant 
to see thousands of people lose their jobs, but the era of bank deregulation 
saw hundreds of thousands of lost jobs. Given that, it's interesting to note 
two points. First, Wells Fargo did fewer big layoffs than its comparison 
company, Bank of 
Arneri~a.~~ Second, upper management, including 
some senior Wells Fargo upper management, suffered more on a percent - 
age basis than lower -level workers in the 
con~olidation.~~ Rigor in a good - 
to-great company applies first at the top, focused on those who hold the 
largest burden of responsibility. 
To be rigorous in people decisions means first becoming rigorous about 
top management people decisions. Indeed, I fear that people might use 
"first who rigor" as an excuse for mindlessly chopping out people to 
improve performance. "It's hard to do, but we've got to be rigorous, " I can 
hear them say. And I cringe. For not only will a lot of hardworking, good 
people get hurt in the process, but the evidence suggests that such tactics 
are contrary to producing sustained great results. The good -to-great com- 
panies rarely used head -count lopping as a tactic and almost never used it 
======================================== [Página 54] ========================================

54 Jim Collins 
as a primary strategy. Even in the Wells Fargo case, the company used lay- 
offs half as much as Bank of America during the transition era. 
Six of the eleven good -to-great companies recorded zero layoffs from 
ten years before the breakthrough date all the way through 1998, and 
four others reported only one or two layoffs. 
In contrast, we found layoffs used five times more frequently in the 
comparison companies than in the good -to-great companies. Some of the 
comparison companies had an almost chronic addiction to layoffs and 
restructuring~.~~ 
It would be a mistake-a tragic mistake, indeed-to think that the way 
you ignite a transition from good to great is by wantonly swinging the ax 
on vast numbers of hardworking people. Endless restructuring and mind - 
less hacking were never part of the good -to-great model. 
How to Be Rigorous 
We've extracted three practical disciplines from the research for being rig- 
orous rather than ruthless. 
Practical Discipline #1: When in doubt, don't hire-keep looking. 
One of the immutable laws of management physics is "Packard's Law. " 
(So called because we first learned it in a previous research project from 
David Packard, cofounder of the Hewlett -Packard Company.) It goes like 
this: No company can grow revenues consistently faster than its ability to 
get enough of the right people to implement that growth and still become 
a great company. If your growth rate in revenues consistently outpaces 
your growth rate in people, you simply will not-indeed cannot-build a 
great company. 
======================================== [Página 55] ========================================

Good to Great 55 
The management team at Circuit City instinctively understood 
Packard's Law. Driving around Santa Barbara the day after Christmas a 
few pears ago, I noticed something different about the Circuit City store. 
Other stores had signs and banners reaching out to customers: "Always the 
Best Prices " or "Great After -Holiday Deals " or "Best After -Christmas 
Selection, " and so forth. But not Circuit City. It had a banner that read: 
"Always Looking for Great People. " 
The sign reminded me of our interview with Walter Bruckart, vice pres - 
ident during the good -to-great years. When asked to name the top five 
factors that led to the transition from mediocrity to excellence, Bruckart 
said, "One would be people. Two would be people. Three would be peo- 
ple. Four would be people. And five would be people. A huge part of our 
transition can be attributed to our discipline in picking the right people. " 
Bruckart then recalled a conversation with CEO Alan Wurtzel during a 
growth spurt at Circuit City: " 'Alan, I'm really wearing down trying to 
find the exact right person to fill this position or that position. At what 
point do I compromise?' Without hesitation, Alan said, You don't com - 
promise. We find another way to get through until we find the right 
people.' 7743 
One of the key contrasts between Alan Wurtzel at Circuit City and Sid- 
ney Cooper at Silo is that Wurtzel spent the bulk of his time in the early 
years focused on getting the right people on the bus, whereas Cooper 
spent 80 percent of his time focusing on the right stores to Wurtzel's 
first goal was to build the best, most professional management team in the 
industry; Cooper's first goal was simply to grow as fast as possible. Circuit 
City put tremendous emphasis on getting the right people all up and 
down the line, from delivery drivers to vice presidents; Silo developed a 
reputation for not being able to do the basics, like making home deliveries 
without damaging the 
 products.45 According to Circuit City's Dan 
Rexinger, "We made the best home delivery drivers in the industry. We 
told them, 'You are the last contact the customer has with Circuit City. 
We are going to supply you with uniforms. We will require that you shave, 
that you don't have B.O. You're going to be professional people.' The 
change in the way we handled customers when making a delivery was 
absolutely incredible. We would get thank -you notes back on how courte - 
ous the drivers 
 were."46 Five years into Wurtzel's tenure, Circuit City and 
Silo had essentially the same business strategy (the same answers to the 
"what" questions), yet Circuit City took off like a rocket, beating the gen- 
eral stock market 18.5 to 1 in the fifteen years after its transition, while Silo 
======================================== [Página 56] ========================================

bumped along until it was finally acquired by a foreign 
 company.47 Same 
strategy, different people, different results. 
Practical Discipline #2: When you know you need to make a people 
change, act. 
The moment you feel the need to tightly manage someone, you've made 
a hiring mistake. The best people don't need to be managed. Guided, 
taught, led-yes. But not tightly managed. We've all experienced or 
observed the following scenario. We have a wrong person on the bus and 
we know it. Yet we wait, we delay, we try alternatives, we give a third and 
fourth chance, we hope that the situation will improve, we invest time in 
trying to properly manage the person, we build little systems to compen - 
sate for his shortcomings, and so forth. But the situation doesn't improve. 
When we go home, we find our energy diverted by thinking (or talking to 
our spouses) about that person. Worse, all the time and energy we spend 
on that one person siphons energy away from developing and working 
with all the right people. We continue to stumble along until the person 
leaves on his own (to our great sense of relief) or we finall y act (also to our 
great sense of relief). Meanwhile, our best people wonder, "What took 
you so long? " 
Letting the wrong people hang around is unfair to all the right people, 
as they inevitably find themselves compensating for the inadequacies of 
the wrong people. Worse, it can drive away the best people. Strong per- 
formers are intrinsically motivated by performance, and when they see 
their efforts impeded by carrying extra weight, they eventually become 
frustrated. 
Waiting too long before acting is equall y unfair to the people who 
need to get off the bus. For every minute you allow a person to continue 
holding a seat when you know that person will not make it in the end, 
you're stealing a portion of his life, time that he could spend finding a 
better place where he could flourish. Indeed, if we're honest with our- 
selves, the reason we wait too long often has less to do with concern for 
that person and more to do with our own convenience. He's doing an 
okay job and it would be a huge hassle to replace him, so we avoid the 
issue. Or we find the whole process of dealing with the issue to be stress - 
ful and distasteful. So, to save ourselves stress and discomfort, we wait. 
And wait. And wait. Meanwhile, all the best people are still wondering, 
"When are they going to do something about this? How long is this going 
to go on?" 
======================================== [Página 57] ========================================

Good to Great 57 
Using data from Moody's Company Information Reports, we were able 
to examine the pattern of turnover in the top management levels. We 
found no difference in the amount of "churn " (turnover within a period of 
time) between the good -to-great and the comparison companies. But we 
did find differences in the pattern of 
churn.48 
The good -to-great leaders did not pursue an expedient "try a lot of peo- 
ple and keep who works " model of management. Instead, they adopted 
the following approach: "Let's take the time to make rigorous A+ selec - 
tions right up front. If we get it right, we'll do everything we can to try to 
keep them on board for a long time. If we make a mistake, then we'll con- 
front that fact so that we can get on with our work and they can get on with 
their lives." 
The good -to-great leaders, however, would not rush to judgment. 
Often, they invested substantial effort in determining whether they had 
someone in the wrong seat before concluding that they had the wrong 
person on the bus entirely. When Colman Mockler became CEO of 
Gillette, he didn't go on a rampage, wantonly throwing people out the win- 
dows of a moving bus. Instead, he spent fully 55 percent of his time during 
his first two years in office jiggering around with the management team, 
changing or moving thirty -eight of the top fifty people. Said Mockler, 
"Every minute devoted to putting the proper person in the proper slot is 
worth weeks of time 
 later."49 Similarly, Alan Wurtzel of Circuit City sent us 
a letter after reading an early draft of this chapter, wherein he commented: 
Your point about "getting the right people on the bus" as compared to 
other companies is dead on. There is one corollary that is also important. 
I spent a lot of time thinking and talking about who sits where on the 
bus. I called it "putting square pegs in square holes and round pegs in 
round holes. " . . . Instead of firing honest and able people who are not 
performing well, it is important to try to move them once or even two or 
three times to other positions where they might blossom.

But how do you know when you know? Two key questions can help. 
First, if it were a hiring decision (rather than a "should this person get off 
the bus?" decision), would you hire the person again? Second, if the per- 
son came to tell you that he or she is leaving to pursue an exciting new 
opportunity, would you feel terribly disappointed or secretly relieved? 
Practical Discipline #3: Put your best people on your biggest opportunities, not 
your biggest problems. 
In the early 1960s, R. J. Reynolds and Philip Morris derived the vast major - 
ity of their revenues from the domestic arena. R. J. Reynolds' approach to 
international business was, "If somebody out there in the world wants a 
Camel, let them call us."50 Joe Cullman at Philip Morris had a different 
view. He identified international markets as the single best opportunity for 
long-term growth, despite the fact that the company derived less than 1 
percent of its revenues from overseas. 
Cullman puzzled over the best "strategy " for developing international 
operations and eventually came up with a brilliant answer: It was not a 
"what" answer, but a "who." He pulled his number one executive, George 
Weissman, off the primary domestic business, and put him in charge of 
international. At the time, international amounted to almost nothing -a 
tiny export department, a struggling investment in Venezuela, another in 
Australia, and a tiny operation in Canada. "When Joe put George in 
charge of international, a lot of people wondered what George had done 
wrong, " quipped one of Weissman's 
  colleague^.^^ "I didn't know whether 
I was being thrown sideways, downstairs or out the window, " said Weiss - 
man. "Here I was running 99% of the company and the next day I'd be 
running 1 % or 
less."52 
Yet, as Forbes magazine observed twenty years later, Cullman's decision 
to move Weissman to the smallest part of the business was a stroke of 
genius. Urbane and sophisticated, Weissman was the perfect person to 
develop markets like Europe, and he built international into the largest 
and fastest -growing part of the company. In fact, under Weissman's stew-

ardship, Marlboro became the best-selling cigarette in the world three 
years before it became number one in the United 
 States.53 
The RJR versus Philip Morris case illustrates a common pattern. The 
good-to-great companies made a habit of putting their best people on their 
best opportunities, not their biggest problems. The comparison compa - 
nies had a penchant for doing just the opposite, failing to grasp the fact 
that managing your problems can only make you good, whereas building 
your opportunities is the only way to become great. 
For instance, when Kimberl y-Clark sold the mills, Darwin Smith made 
it clear: The company might be getting rid of the paper business, but it 
would keep its best people. "Many of our people had come up through the 
paper business. Then, all of a sudden, the crown jewels are being sold off 
and they're asking, 'What is my future?' " explained Dick Auchter. "And 
Darwin would say, 'We need all the talented managers we can get. We 
keep them.' 7754 Despite the fact that they had little or no consumer expe- 
rience, Smith moved all the best paper people to the consumer business. 
We interviewed Dick Appert, a senior executive who spent the majority 
of his career in the papermaking division at Kimberly -Clark, the same 
division sold off to create funds for the company's big move into consumer 
products. He talked with pride and excitement about the transformation 
of Kimberly -Clark, how it had the guts to sell the paper mills, how it had 
the foresight to exit the paper business and throw the proceeds into the 
consumer business, and how it had taken on Procter & Gamble. "I never 
had any argument with our decision to dissolve the paper division of the 
company, " he said. "We did get rid of the paper mills at that time, and I 
was in absolute agreement with Stop and think about that for a 
moment. The right people want to be part of building something great, 
and Dick Appert saw that Kimberly -Clark could become great by selling 
the part of the company where he had spent most of his working life. 
The Philip Morris and Kimberly -Clark cases illustrate a final point 
======================================== [Página 60] ========================================

60 Jim Collins 
about "the right people. " We noticed a Level 5 atmosphere at the top 
executive level of every good -to-great company, especially during the key 
transition years. Not that every executive on the team became a fully 
evolved Level 5 leader to the same degree as Darwin Smith or Colman 
Mockler, but each core member of the team transformed personal ambi - 
tion into ambition for the company. This suggests that the team members 
had Level 5 potential -or at least they were capable of operating in a 
manner consistent with the Level 5 leadership style. 
You might be wondering, "What's the difference between a Level 5 
executive team member and just being a good soldier? " A Level 5 execu - 
tive team member does not blindly acquiesce to authority and is a strong 
leader in her own right, so driven and talented that she builds her arena 
into one of the very best in the world. Yet each team member must also 
have the ability to meld that strength into doing whatever it takes to make 
the company great. 
An article on Philip Morris said of the Cullman era, "These guys never 
agreed on anything and they would argue about everything, and they 
would kill each other and involve everyone, high and low, talented peo- 
ple. But when they had to make a decision, the decision would emerge. 
This made Philip 
 Morri~."~~ No matter how much they argued, said a 
Philip Morris executive, "they were always in search of the best answer. In 
the end, everybody stood behind the decision. All of the debates were for 
the common good of the company, not your own  interest^."^' 
FIRST WHO, GREAT COMPANIES, 
AND A GREAT LIFE 
Whenever I teach the good -to-great findings, someone almost always 
raises the issue of the personal cost in making a transition from good to 
======================================== [Página 61] ========================================

Good to Great 61 
great. In other words, is it possible to build a great company and also build 
a great life? 
Yes. 
The secret to doing so lies right in this chapter. 
I spent a few short days with a senior Gillette executive and his wife at 
an executive conference in Hong Kong. During the course of our conver - 
sations, I asked them if they thought Colman Mockler, the CEO most 
responsible for Gillette's transition from good to great, had a great life. 
Colman's life revolved around three great loves, they told me: his family, 
Harvard, and Gillette. Even during the darkest and most intense times of 
the takeover crises of the 1980s and despite the increasingly global nature 
of Gillette's business, Mockler maintained remarkable balance in his life. 
He did not significantl y reduce the amount of time he spent with his fam- 
ily, rarely working evenings or weekends. He maintained his disciplined 
worship practices. He continued his active work on the governing board 
of Harvard 
 C~llege.~~ 
When I asked how Mockler accomplished all of this, the executive 
said, "Oh, it really wasn't that hard for him. He was so good at assem - 
bling the right people around him, and putting the right people in the 
right slots, that he just didn't need to be there all hours of the day and 
night. That was Colman's whole secret to success and balance. " The 
executive went on to explain that he was just as likely to meet Mockler 
in the hardware store as at the office. "He really enjoyed puttering 
around the house, fixing things up. He always seemed to find time to 
relax that way." Then the executive's wife added, "When Colman died 
and we all went to the funeral, I looked around and realized how much 
love was in the room. This was a man who spent nearl y all his waking 
hours with people who loved him, who loved what they were doing, 
and who loved one another-at work, at home, in his charitable work, 
wherever. " 
And the statement rang a bell for me, as there was something about the 
good -to-great executive teams that I couldn't quite describe, but that 
clearly set them apart. In wrapping up our interview with George Weiss- 
man of Philip Morris, I commented, "When you talk about your time at 
the company, it's as if you are describing a love affair. " He chuckled and 
said, "Yes. Other than my marriage, it was the passionate love affair of 
my life. I don't think many people would understand what I'm talking 
about, but I suspect my colleagues would. " Weissman and many of his 
executive colleagues kept offices at Philip Morris, coming in on a regu- 
======================================== [Página 62] ========================================

lar basis, long after retirement. A corridor at the Philip Morris world 
headquarters is called "the hall of the wizards of 
was."59 It's the corridor 
where Weissman, Cullman, Maxwell, and others continue to come into 
the office, in large part because they simply enjoy spending time 
together. Similarly, Dick Appert of Kimberly -Clark said in his interview, 
"I never had anyone in Kimberly -Clark in all my forty -one years say any- 
thing unkind to me. I thank God the day I was hired because I've been 
associated with wonderful people. Good, good people who respected 
and admired one another.060 
Members of the good -to-great teams tended to become and remain 
friends for life. In many cases, they are still in close contact with each 
other years or decades after working together. It was striking to hear them 
talk about the transition era, for no matter how dark the days or how big 
the tasks, these people had fun! They enjoyed each other's company and 
actually looked forward to meetings. A number of the executives charac - 
terized their years on the good-to-great teams as the high point of their 
lives. Their experiences went beyond just mutual respect (which they cer- 
tainly had), to lasting comradeship. 
Adherence to the idea of "first who" might be the closest link between a 
great company and a great life. For no matter what we achieve, if we don't 
spend the vast majority of our time with people we love and respect, we 
cannot possibly have a great life. But if we spend the vast majority of our 
time with people we love and respect-people we really enjoy being on the 
bus with and who will never disappoint us-then we will almost certainly 
have a great life, no matter where the bus goes. The people we inter- 
viewed from the good -to-great companies clearly loved what they did, 
largely because they loved who they did it with.

CHAPTER 4 
There is no worse mistake in public leadership than to hold 
out false hopes soon to be swept away. 
-WINSTON S. CHURCHILL, 
The Hinge of Fate1 
n the early 1950s, the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, com- 
monly known as A&P, stood as the largest retailing organization in the 
world and one of the largest corporations in the United States, at one 
point ranking behind only General Motors in annual sales.2 Kroger, in 
contrast, stood as an unspectacular grocery chain, less than half the size of 
A&P, with performance that barely kept pace with the general market. 
Then in the 1960s, A&P began to falter while Kroger began to lay the 
foundations for a transition into a great company. From 1959 to 1973, 
both companies lagged behind the market, with Kroger pulling just a bit 
ahead of A&P. After that, the two companies completely diverged, and 
over the next twenty -five years, Kroger generated cumulative returns ten 
times the market and eighty times better than A&P. 
How did such a dramatic reversal of fortunes happen? And how could a 
company as great as A&P become so awful?

A&P had a perfect model for the first half of the twentieth century, 
when two world wars and a depression imposed frugality upon Ameri - 
cans: cheap, plentiful groceries sold in utilitarian stores. But in the afflu- 
ent second half of the twentieth century, Americans changed. They 
wanted nicer stores, bigger stores, more choices in stores. They wanted 
fresh -baked bread, flowers, health foods, cold medicines, fresh produce, 
forty-five choices of cereal, and ten types of milk. They wanted offbeat 
items, like five different types of expensive sprouts and various concoc - 
tions of protein powder and Chinese healing herbs. Oh, and they wanted 
to be able to do their banking and get their annual flu shots while shop - 
ping. In short, they no longer wanted grocery stores. They wanted Super - 
stores, with a big block "S" on the chest-offering almost everything 
under one roof, with lots of parking, cheap prices, clean floors, and a 
gazillion checkout lines. 
Now, right off the bat, you might be thinking: "Okay, so the story of 
A&P is one of an aging company that had a strategy that was right for the 
times, but the times changed and the world passed it by as younger, better- 
attuned companies gave customers more of what they wanted. What's so 
interesting about that?" 
Here's what's interesting: Both Kroger and A&P were old companies 
(Kroger at 82 years, A&P at 11 1 years) heading into the 1970s; both com- 
panies had nearly all their assets invested in traditional grocery stores; both 
companies had strongholds outside the major growth areas of the United 
States; and both companies had knowledge of how the world around them 
was changing. Yet one of these two companies confronted the brutal facts 
of reality head -on and completely changed its entire system in response; 
the other stuck its head in the sand. 
In 1958, Forbes magazine described A&P as "the Hermit Kingdom, " 
run as an absolute monarchy by an aging 
 prince.3 Ralph Burger, the suc- 
cessor to the Hartford brothers who had built the A&P dynasty, sought to 
preserve two things above all else: cash dividends for the family founda - 
tion and the past glory of the Hartford brothers. According to one A&P 
director, Burger "considered himself the reincarnation of old John Hart- 
ford, even to the point of wearing a flower in his lapel every day from 
Hartford's greenhouse. He tried to carry out, against all opposition, what 
he thought Mr. John [Hartford] would have 
 liked."4 Burger instilled a 
"what would Mr. Hartford do? " approach to decisions, living by the motto 
"You can't argue with a hundred years of 
~uccess."~ Indeed, through 
======================================== [Página 68] ========================================

Burger, Mr. Hartford continued to be the dominant force on the board 
for nearly twenty years. Never mind the fact that he was alread y dead.6 
As the brutal facts about the mismatch between its past model and the 
changing world began to pile up, A&P mounted an increasingly spirited 
defense against those facts. In one series of events, the company opened a 
new store called The Golden Key, a separate brand wherein it could 
experiment with new methods and models to learn what customers 
wanted.: It sold no A&P-branded products, it gave the store manager more 
freedom, it experimented with innovative new departments, and it began 
to evolve toward the modern superstore. Customers really liked it. Here, 
right under their noses, they began to discover the answer to the questions 
of why the! were losing market share and what they could do about it. 
What did A&P executives do with The Golden Key? 
They didn't like the answers that it gave, so they closed it.8 
A&P then began a pattern of lurching from one strategy to another, 
always looking for a single -stroke solution to its problems. It held pep ral- 
lies, launched programs, grabbed fads, fired CEOs, hired CEOs, and fired 
them yet again. It launched what one industry observer called a "scorched 
earth policy, " a radical price -cutting strategy to build market share, but 
never dealt with the basic fact that customers wanted not lower prices, but 
different 
  store^.^ The price cutting led to cost cutting, which led to even 
drabber stores and poorer service, which in turn drove customers away, 
further driving down margins, resulting in even dirtier stores and worse 
service. "After a while the crud kept mounting, " said one former A&P 
manager. "We not only had dirt, we had dirty dirt."1° 
Meanwhile, over at Kroger, a completely different pattern arose. Kroger 
also conducted experiments in the 1960s to test the superstore concept." 
By 1970, the Kroger executive team came to an inescapable conclusion: 
The old-model grocery store (which accounted for nearl y 100 percent of 
Kroger's business) was going to become extinct. Unlike A&P, however, 
Kroger confronted this brutal truth and acted on it. 
The rise of Kroger is remarkably simple and straightforward, almost 
maddeningly so. During their interviews, Lyle Everingham and his prede - 
cessor Jim Herring (CEOs during the pivotal transition years) were polite 
and helpful, but a bit exasperated by our questions. To them, it just 
seemed so clear. When we asked Everingham to allocate one hundred 
points across the top five factors in the transition, he said: "I find your 
question a bit perplexing. Basically, we did extensive research, and the 
data came back loud and clear: The supercombination stores were the 
======================================== [Página 69] ========================================

way of the future. We also learned that you had to be number one or num - 
ber two in each market, or you had to exit.* Sure, there was some skepti - 
cism at first. But once we looked at the facts, there was really no question 
about what we had to do. So we just did it."12 
Kroger decided to eliminate, change, or replace every single store and 
depart every region that did not fit the new realities. The whole system 
would be turned inside out, store by store, block by block, city by city, 
, state by state. By the early 1990s, Kroger had rebuilt its entire system on 
the new model and was well on the way to becoming the number one gro- 
cery chain in America, a position it would attain in 1999.13 Meanwhile, 
A&P still had over half its stores in the old 1950s size and had dwindled to 
a sad remnant of a once -great American institution.14 
FACTS ARE BETTER THAN DREAMS 
One of the dominant themes from our research is that breakthrough 
results come about by a series of good decisions, diligently executed and 
accumulated one on top of another. Of course, the good -to-great compa - 
nies did not have a perfect track record. But on the whole, they made 
many more good decisions than bad ones, and they made many more 
good decisions than the comparison companies. Even more important, on 
the really big choices, such as Kroger7s decision to throw all its resources 
into the task of converting its entire system to the superstore concept, they 
were remarkably on target. 
This, of course, begs a question. Are we merely studying a set of com- 
panies that just happened by luck to stumble into the right set of deci- 
sions? Or was there something distinctive about their process that 
dramatically increased the likelihood of being right? The answer, it turns 
out, is that there was something quite distinctive about their process. 
The good -to-great companies displayed two distinctive forms of disci- 
plined thought. The first, and the topic of this chapter, is that they infused 
the entire process with the brutal facts of reality. (The second, which we 
*Keep in mind, this was the early 1970s, a full decade before the "number one, num - 
ber two, or exit" idea became mainstream. Kroger, like all good -to-great companies, 
developed its ideas by paying attention to the data right in front of it, not by following 
trends and fads set by others. Interestingly, over half the good-to-great companies had 
some version of the "number one, number two" concept in place years before it 
became a management fad. 
======================================== [Página 70] ========================================

will discuss in the next chapter, is that they developed a simple, yet deeply 
insightful, frame of reference for all decisions.) When, as in the Kroger 
case, you start with an honest and diligent effort to determine the truth of 
the situation, the right decisions often become self-evident. Not always, of 
course, but often. And even if all decisions do not become self-evident, 
one thing is certain: You absolutely cannot make a series of good decisions 
without first confronting the brutal facts. The good -to-great companies 
operated in accordance with this principle, and the comparison compa - 
nies generally did not. 
Consider Pitney Bowes versus Addressograph. It would be hard to find 
two companies in more similar positions at a specific moment in history 
that then diverged so dramatically. Until 1973, they had similar revenues, 
profits, numbers of employees, and stock charts. Both companies held 
near-monopoly market positions with virtually the same customer base- 
Pitney Bowes in postage meters and Addressograph in address -duplicating 
machines -and both faced the imminent reality of losing their monopo- 
lies.15 By 2000, however, Pitney Bowes had grown to over 30,000 emplo y- 
ees and revenues in excess of $4 billion, compared to the sorry remnants 
of Addressograph, which had less than $100 million and only 670 employ- 
ees.16 For the shareholder, Pitney Bowes outperformed Addressograph 
3,581 to 1 (yes, three thousand five hundred and eighty -one times better). 
In 1976, a charismatic visionary leader named Roy Ash became CEO 
of Addressograph. A self-described "conglomerateur, " Ash had previously 
built Litton by stacking acquisitions together that had since faltered. 
According to Fortune, he sought to use Addressograph as a platform to 
reestablish his leadership prowess in the eyes of the world.17 
Ash set forth a vision to dominate the likes of IBM, Xerox, and Kodak in 
the emerging field of office automation -a bold plan for a company that 
had previously only dominated the envelope -address -duplication busi- 
ness.18 There is nothing wrong with a bold vision, but Ash became so wed - 
ded to his quixotic quest that, according to Business Week, he refused to 
confront the mounting evidence that his plan was doomed to fail and 
might take down the rest of the company with it.19 He insisted on milking 
cash from profitable arenas, eroding the core business while throwing 
money after a gambit that had little chance of 
success.20 
Later, after Ash was thrown out of office and the company had filed for 
bankruptcy (from which it did later emerge), he still refused to confront 
reality, saying: "We lost some battles, but we were winning the 
war."21 But

Addressograph was not even close to winning the war, and people through - 
out the company knew it at the time. Yet the truth went unheard until it 
was too late.22 In fact, many of Addressograph's key people bailed out of 
the company, dispirited by their inability to get top management to deal 
with the 
facts.23 
Perhaps we should give Mr. Ash some credit for being a visionary who 
tried to push his company to greater heights. (And, to be fair, the Address - 
ograph board fired Ash before he had a chance to fully carry out his 
plans.)24 But the evidence from a slew of respectable articles written at the 
time suggests that Ash turned a blind eye to any reality inconsistent with 
his own vision of the world.

"When you turn over rocks and look at all the squiggly things under - 
neath, you can either put the rock down, or you can say, 'My job is to turn 
over rocks and look at the squiggly things,' even if what you see can scare 
the hell out of 
you."25 That quote, from Pitney Bowes executive Fred Pur- 
due, could have come from any of the Pitney Bowes executives we inter- 
viewed. They all seemed a bit, well, to be blunt, neurotic and compulsive 
about Pitney's position in the world. "This is a culture that is very hostile 
to complacency, " said one 
exe~utive.~~ "We have an itch that what we just 
accomplished, no matter how great, is never going to be good enough to 
sustain us," said 
 an~ther.~' 
Pitney's first management meeting of the new year typically consisted 
of about fifteen minutes discussing the previous year (almost always 
superb results) and two hours talking about the "scary squiggl y things " that 
might impede future 
 results.28 Pitney Bowes sales meetings were quite dif- 
ferent from the "aren't we great" rah-rah sales conferences typical at most 
companies: The entire management team would lay itself open to searing 
questions and challenges from salespeople who dealt directly with cus- 
tomer~.~~ The company created a long -standing tradition of forums where 
people could stand up and tell senior executives what the company was 
doing wrong, shoving rocks with squiggly things in their faces, and saying, 
"Look! You'd better pay attention to 
this."30 
The Addressograph case, especially in contrast to Pitney Bowes, illus- 
trates a vital point. Strong, charismatic leaders like Roy Ash can all too 
easily become the de facto reality driving a company. Throughout the 
study, we found comparison companies where the top leader led with 
such force or instilled such fear that people worried more about the 
leader-what he would say, what he would think, what he would do- 
than they worried about external reality and what it could do to the com- 
pany. Recall the climate at Bank of America, described in the previous 
chapter, wherein managers would not even make a comment until they 
knew how the CEO felt. We did not find this pattern at companies like 
Wells Fargo and Pitney Bowes, where people were much more worried 
about the scary squiggly things than about the feelings of top manage - 
ment. 
The moment a leader allows himself to become the primary reality peo- 
ple worry about, rather than reality being the primary reality, you have a 
recipe for mediocrity, or worse. This is one of the key reasons why less 
charismatic leaders often produce better long-term results than their more 
charismatic counterparts.

Good to Great 73 
Winston Churchill understood the liabilities of his strong personality, 
and he compensated for them beautifully during the Second World War. 
Churchill, as you know, maintained a bold and unwavering vision that 
Britain would not just survive, but prevail as a great nation-despite the 
whole world wondering not if but when Britain would sue for peace. Dur- 
ing the darkest days, with nearly all of Europe and North Africa under 
Nazi control, the United States hoping to stay out of the conflict, and 
Hitler fighting a one -front war (he had not yet turned on Russia), 
Churchill said: "We are resolved to destroy Hitler and every vestige of the 
Nazi regime. From this, nothing will turn us. Nothing! We will never par- 
ley. We will never negotiate with Hitler or any of his gang. We shall fight 
him by land. We shall fight him by sea. We shall fight him in the air. 
Until, with God's help, we have rid the earth of his 
shadow."31 
Armed with this bold vision, Churchill never failed, however, to con - 
front the most brutal facts. He feared that his towering, charismatic 
personality might deter bad news from reaching him in its starkest form. 
So, early in the war, he created an entirely separate department outside 
the normal chain of command, called the Statistical Office, with the prin- 
cipal function of feeding him -continuously updated and completely 
unfiltered -the most brutal facts of reality.j2 He relied heavily on this spe- 
cial unit throughout the war, repeatedly asking for facts, just the facts. As 
the Nazi panzers swept across Europe, Churchill went to bed and slept 
soundly: "I . . . had no need for cheering dreams, " he wrote. "Facts are 
better than 
 dreams."33 
A CLIMATE WHERE THE TRUTH IS HEARD 
Now, you might be wondering, "How do you motivate people with brutal 
facts? Doesn't motivation flow chiefly from a compelling vision? " The 
======================================== [Página 74] ========================================

74 ]im Collins 
answer, surprisingly, is, "No." Not because vision is unimportant, but 
because expending energy trying to motivate people is largely a waste of 
time. One of the dominant themes that runs throughout this book is that 
if you successfully implement its findings, you will not need to spend time 
and energy "motivating7' people. If you have the right people on the bus, 
they will be self-motivated. The real question then becomes: How do you 
manage in such a way as not to de-motivate people? And one of the single 
most de -motivating actions you can take is to hold out false hopes, soon to 
be swept away by events. 
How do you create a climate where the truth is heard? We offer four 
basic practices: 
1. Lead with questions, not answers. 
In 1973, one year after he assumed CEO responsibility from his father, 
Alan Wurtzel's company stood at the brink of bankruptcy, dangerously 
close to violation of its loan agreements. At the time, the company 
(then named Wards, not to be confused with Montgomery Ward) was a 
hodgepodge of appliance and hi-fi stores with no unifying concept. 
Over the next ten years, Wurtzel and his team not only turned the com- 
pany around, but also created the Circuit City concept and laid the 
foundations for a stunning record of results, beating the market twenty- 
two times from its transition date in 1982 to January 1, 2000. 
When Alan Wurtzel started the long traverse from near bankruptcy 
to these stellar results, he began with a remarkable answer to the ques- 
tion of where to take the company: I don't know. Unlike leaders such as 
Roy Ash of Addressograph, Wurtzel resisted the urge to walk in with 
"the answer. " Instead, once he put the right people on the bus, he 
began not with answers, but with questions. "Alan was a real spark, " 
said a board member. "He had an ability to ask questions that were just 
======================================== [Página 75] ========================================

Good to Great 75 
marvelous. We had some wonderful debates in the boardroom. It was 
never just a dog and pony show, where you would just listen and then 
go to 
lunch."34 Indeed, Wurtzel stands as one of the few CEOs in a 
large corporation who put more questions to his board members than 
they put to him. 
He used the same approach with his executive team, constantly 
pushing and probing and prodding with questions. Each step along the 
way, Wurtzel would keep asking questions until he had a clear picture 
of reality and its implications. "They used to call me the prosecutor, 
because I would home in on a question, " said Wurtzel. "You know, like 
a bulldog, I wouldn't let go until I understood. Why, why, why?" 
Like Wurtzel, leaders in each of the good -to-great transitions oper - 
ated with a somewhat Socratic style. Furthermore, they used questions 
for one and only one reason: to gain understanding. They didn't use 
questions as a form of manipulation ("Don't you agree with me on 
that? . . .") or as a way to blame or put down others ( "Why did you mess 
this up? . . ."). When we asked the executives about their management 
team meetings during the transition era, they said that they spent much 
of the time "just trying to understand. " 
The good -to-great leaders made particularly good use of informal 
meetings where they'd meet with groups of managers and employees 
with no script, agenda, or set of action items to discuss. Instead, they 
would start with questions like: "So, what's on your mind? " "Can you 
tell me about that?" "Can you help me understand? " "What should we 
be worried about? " These non-agenda meetings became a forum where 
current realities tended to bubble to the surface. 
2. Engage in dialogue and debate, not coercion. 
In 1965, you could hardly find a company more awful than Nucor. It 
had only one division that made money. Everything else drained cash. 
It had no culture to be proud of. It had no consistent direction. It was 
======================================== [Página 76] ========================================

76 lim Collins 
on the verge of bankruptcy. At the time, Nucor was officially known as 
the Nuclear Corporation of America, reflecting its orientation to 
nuclear energy products, including the Scintillation Probe (yes, they 
really named it that), used for radiation measurement. It had acquired a 
series of unrelated businesses in such arenas as semiconductor supplies, 
rare earth materials, electrostatic office copiers, and roof joists. At the 
start of its transformation in 1965, Nucor did not manufacture one 
ounce of steel. Nor did it make a penny of profit. Thirty years later, 
Nucor stood as the fourth -largest steelmaker in the and by 1999 
made greater annual profits than any other American steel 
 company.36 
How did Nucor transition from the utterly awful Nuclear Corpora - 
tion of America into perhaps the best steel company in America? First, 
Nucor benefited from the emergence of a Level 5 leader, Ken Iverson, 
promoted to CEO from general manager of the joist division. Second, 
Iverson got the right people on the bus, building a remarkable team of 
people like Sam Siegel (described by one of his colleagues as "the best 
money manager in the world, a magician ") and David Aycock, an oper- 
ations 
 genius.37 
And then what? 
Like Alan Wurtzel, Iverson dreamed of building a .great company, 
but refused to begin with "the answer " for how to get there. Instead, he 
played the role of Socratic moderator in a series of raging debates. "We 
established an ongoing series of general manager meetings, and my role 
was more as a mediator, " commented Iverson. "They were chaos. We 
would stay there for hours, ironing out the issues, until we came to 
something. . . . At times, the meetings would get so violent that people 
almost went across the table at each other. . . . People yelled. They 
waved their arms around and pounded on tables. Faces would get red 
and veins bulged 
 out."38 
Iverson's assistant tells of a scene repeated over the years, wherein 
colleagues would march into Iverson's office and yell and scream at 
each other, but then emerge with a 
 concl~sion.~~ Argue and debate, 
then sell the nuclear business; argue and debate, then focus on steel 
joists; argue and debate, then begin to manufacture their own steel; 
argue and debate, then invest in their own mini -mill; argue and 
debate, then build a second mini -mill, and so forth. Nearly all the 
Nucor executives we spoke with described a climate of debate, 
wherein the company's strategy "evolved through many agonizing 
arguments and fights.040

3. Conduct autopsies, without blame. 
In 1978, Philip Morris acquired the Seven -Up Company, only to sell 
it eight years later at a loss.41 The financial loss was relatively small 
compared to Philip Morris's total assets, but it was a highly visible 
black eye that consumed thousands of hours of precious management 
time. 
In our interviews with the Philip Morris executives, we were struck 
by how they all brought up the debacle on their own and discussed it 
openly. Instead of hiding their big, ugly mistake, they seemed to feel an 
almost therapeutic need to talk about it. In his book, I'm a Lucky Guy, 
Joe Cullman dedicates five pages to dissecting the 7UP disaster. He 
doesn't hold back the embarrassing truth about how flawed the deci- 
sion was. It is a five-page clinical analysis of the mistake, its implica - 
tions, and its lessons. 
Hundreds, if not thousands, of people hours had been spent in autop - 
sies of the 7UP case. Yet, as much as they talked about this conspicuous 
failure, no one pointed fingers to single out blame. There is only one 
exception to this pattern: Joe Cullman, standing in front of the mirror, 
pointing the finger right at himself. "[It] . . . became apparent that this 
was another Joe Cullman plan that didn't work, " he 
writes.42 He goes 
even further, impl ying that if he'd only listened better to the people 
who challenged his idea at the time, the disaster might have been 
averted. He goes out of his way to give credit to those who were right in 
retrospect, naming those specific individuals who were more prescient 
than himself. 
In an era when leaders go to great lengths to preserve the image of 
their own track record -stepping forth to claim credit about how they 
were visionary when their colleagues were not, but finding others to 
blame when their decisions go awry -it is quite refreshing to come 
======================================== [Página 78] ========================================

78 Jim Collins 
across Cullman. He set the tone: "I will take responsibility for this bad 
decision. But we will all take responsibility for extracting the maximum 
learning from the tuition we've paid." 
4. Build "red flag" mechanisms. 
We live in an information age, when those with more and better infor- 
mation supposedly have an advantage. If you look across the rise and 
fall of organizations, however, you will rarely find companies stumbling 
because they lacked information. 
Bethlehem Steel executives had known for years about the threat 
of mini-mill companies like Nucor. They paid little attention until 
they woke up one day to discover large chunks of market share taken 
away.43 
Upjohn had plenty of information that indicated some of its forth - 
coming products would fail to deliver anticipated results or, worse, had 
potentially serious side effects. Yet it often ignored those problems. With 
Halcion, for example, an insider was quoted in Newsweek saying, "dis- 
missing safety concerns about Halcion had become virtual company 
policy. " In another case when Upjohn found itself under fire, it framed 
its problems as "adverse publicity, " rather than confronting the truth of 
its own 
 short~omings.~~ 
Executives at Bank of America had plenty of information about the 
realities of deregulation, yet they failed to confront the one big implica - 
tion of those realities: In a deregulated world, banking would be a com- 
modity, and the old perks and genteel traditions of banking would be 
gone forever. Not until it had lost $1.8 billion did Bank of America fully 
accept this fact. In contrast, Carl Reichardt of Wells Fargo, called the 
ultimate realist by his predecessor, hit the brutal facts of deregulation 
head-on.45 Sorry, fellow bankers, but we can preserve the banker class 
no more. We've got to be businessmen with as much attention to costs 
and effectiveness as McDonald's. 
======================================== [Página 79] ========================================

One particularly powerful way to accomplish this is through red flag 
mechanisms. Allow me to use a personal example to illustrate the idea. 
When teaching by the case method at Stanford Business School, I 
issued to each MBA student an 8.5" x 11" bright red sheet of paper, 
with the following instructions: "This is your red flag for the quarter. If 
you raise your hand with your red flag, the classroom will stop for you. 
There are no restrictions on when and how to use your red flag; the 
decision rests entirely in your hands. You can use it to voice an observa - 
tion, share a personal experience, present an analysis, disagree with the 
professor, challenge a CEO guest, respond to a fellow student, ask a 
question, make a suggestion, or whatever. There will be no penalty 
whatsoever for any use of a red flag. Your red flag can be used only once 
during the quarter. Your red flag is nontransferable; you cannot give or 
sell it to another student. " 
With the red flag, I had no idea precisely what would happen each day 
in class. In one situation, a student used her red flag to state, "Professor 
Collins, I think you are doing a particularly ineffective job of running 
class today. You are leading too much with your questions and stifling our 
independent thinking. Let us think for ourselves. " The red flag con- 
fronted me with the brutal fact that my own questioning style stood in the 
way of people's learning. A student survey at the end of the quarter would 
have given me that same information. But the red flag-real time, in 
front of everyone in the classroom -turned information about the short - 
comings of the class into information that I absolutely could not ignore. 
I got the idea for red flag mechanisms from Bruce Woolpert, who 
instituted a particularly powerful device called short pay at his company 
Graniterock. Short pay gives the customer full discretionary power to 
decide whether and how much to pay on an invoice based upon his 
own subjective evaluation of how satisfied he feels with a product or ser -

return the product, nor does he need to call Graniterock for permis - 
sion. He simply circles the offending item on the invoice, deducts it 
from the total, and sends a check for the balance. When I asked 
Woolpert his reasons for short pay, he said, "You can get a lot of infor - 
mation from customer surveys, but there are always ways of explaining 
away the data. With short pay, you absolutely have to pay attention to 
the data. You often don't know that a customer is upset until you lose 
that customer entirely. Short pay acts as an early warning system that 
forces us to adjust quickly, long before we would lose that customer. " 
To be clear, we did not generally find red flag mechanisms as vivid 
and dramatic as short pay in the good -to-great companies. Nonetheless, 
I've decided to include this idea here, at the urging of research assistant 
Lane Hornung. Hornung, who helped me systematically research and 
collate mechanisms across companies for a different research project, 
makes the compelling argument that if you're a fully developed Level 5 
leader, you might not need red flag mechanisms. But if you are not yet 
a Level 5 leader, or if you suffer the liability of charisma, red flag mech - 
anisms give you a practical and useful tool for turning information into 
information that cannot be ignored and for creating a climate where 
the truth is heard.* 
UNWAVERING FAITH AMID THE BRUTAL FACTS 
When Procter & Gamble invaded the paper -based consumer business in 
the late 1960s, Scott Paper (then the leader) simply resigned itself to sec- 
ond place without a fight and began looking for ways to 
diversify.46 "The 
company had a meeting for analysts in 1971 that was one of the most 
depressing I've ever attended, " said one analyst. "Management essentially 
threw in the towel and said, 'We've been had.' "47 The once -proud com- 
pany began to look at its competition and say, "Here's how we stack up 
against the best," and sigh, "Oh, well . . . at least there are people in the 
business worse than we 
are."48 Instead of figuring out how to get back on 
the offensive and win, Scott just tried to protect what it had. Conceding 
the top end of the market to P&G, Scott hoped that, by hiding away in

the B category, it would be left alone by the big monster that had invaded 
its turf.49 
Kimberly -Clark, on the other hand, viewed competing against Procter 
& Gamble not as a liability, but as an asset. Darwin Smith and his team 
felt exhilarated by the idea of going up against the best, seeing it as an 
opportunity to make Kimberly -Clark better and stronger. They also 
viewed it as a way to stimulate the competitive juices of Kimberly people 
at all levels. At one internal gathering, Darwin Smith stood up and started 
his talk by saying, "Okay, I want everyone to rise in a moment of silence. " 
Everyone looked around, wondering what Darwin was up to. Did some - 
one die? And so, after a moment of confusion, they all stood up and stared 
at their shoes in reverent silence. After an appropriate pause, Smith 
looked out at the group and said in a somber tone, "That was a moment of 
silence for P&G." 
The place went bananas. Blair White, a director who witnessed the 
incident, said, "He had everyone wound up in this thing, all up and down 
the company, right down to the plant floor. We were taking on 
G~liath!"~~ 
Later, Wayne Sanders (Smith's successor) described to us the incredible 
benefit of competing against the best: "Could we have a better adversary 
than P&G? Not a chance. I say that because we respect them so much. 
They are bigger than we are. They are very talented. They are great at 
marketing. They beat the hell out of every one of their competitors, except 
one, Kimberly -Clark. That is one of the things that makes us so 
 proud."51 
Robert Aders of Kroger summed this up nicely at the end of his inter - 
view, describing the psycholog y of the Kroger team as it faced the daunting 
twenty -year task of methodically turning over the entire Kroger system. 
"There was a certain Churchillian character to what we were doing. We 
had a very strong will to live, the sense that we are Kroger, Kroger was here 
before and will be here long after we are gone, and, by god, we are going

to win this thing. It might take us a hundred years, but we will persist for a 
hundred years, if that's what it 
takes.7752 
Throughout our research, we were continually reminded of the "hardi - 
ness" research studies done by the International Committee for the Study 
of Victimization. These studies looked at people who had suffered serious 
adversity -cancer patients, prisoners of war, accident victims, and so 
forth-and survived. They found that people fell generally into three cat- 
egories: those who were permanently dispirited by the event, those who 
got their life back to normal, and those who used the experience as a 
defining event that made them 
 stronger.s3 The good -to-great companies 
were like those in the third group, with the "hardiness factor. " 
When Fannie Mae began its transition in the early 1980s, almost no 
one gave it high odds for success, much less for greatness. Fannie Mae 
had $56 billion of loans that were losing money. It received about 9 per- 
cent interest on its mortgage portfolio but had to pay up to 15 percent on 
the debt it issued. Multiply that difference times $56 billion, and you get 
a very large negative number! Furthermore, by charter, Fannie Mae could 
not diversify outside the mortgage finance business. Most people viewed 
Fannie Mae as totally beholden to shifts in the direction of interest 
rates-they go up and Fannie Mae loses, they go down and Fannie Mae 
wins-and many believed that Fannie Mae could succeed only if the gov- 
ernment stepped in to clamp down on interest 
 rates.54 "That's their only 
hope, " said one 
analyst.55 
But that's not the way David Maxwell and his newly assembled team 
viewed the situation. They never wavered in their faith, consistently 
emphasizing in their interviews with us that they never had the goal to 
merely survive but to prevail in the end as a great company. Yes, the inter- 
est spread was a brutal fact that was not going to magically disappear. Fan- 
nie Mae had no choice but to become the best capital markets player in 
the world at managing mortgage interest risk. Maxwell and his team set 
out to create a new business model that would depend much less on inter- 
est rates, involving the invention of very sophisticated mortgage finance 
instruments. Most analysts responded with derision. "When you've got 
$56 billion worth of loans in place and underwater, talking about new pro- 
grams is a joke," said one. "That's like Chrysler [then asking for federal 
loan guarantees to stave off bankruptcy] going into the aircraft 
 business."56 
After completing my interview with David Maxwell, I asked how he 
and his team dealt with the naysayers during those dark days. "It was never 
an issue internally, " he said. "Of course, we had to stop doing a lot of stu- 
======================================== [Página 83] ========================================

Good to Great 83 
pid things, and we had to invent a completel y new set of financial devices. 
But we never entertained the possibility that we would fail. We were going 
to use the calamity as an opportunity to remake Fannie Mae into a great 
company."57 
During a research meeting, a team member commented that Fannie 
Mae reminded her of an old television show, The Six Million Dollar Man 
with Lee Majors. The pretext of the series is that an astronaut suffers a seri- 
ous crash while testing a moon landing craft over a southwestern desert. 
Instead of just trying to save the patient, doctors completely redesign him 
into a superhuman cyborg, installing atomic -powered robotic devices such 
as a powerful left eye and mechanical 
 limbs.58 Similarly, David Maxwell 
and his team didn't use the fact that Fannie Mae was bleeding and near 
death as a pretext to merely restructure the company. They used it as an 
opportunity to create something much stronger and more powerful. Step 
by step, day by day, month by month, the Fannie Mae team rebuilt the 
entire business model around risk management and reshaped the corpo - 
rate culture into a high-performance machine that rivaled anything on 
Wall Street, eventually generating stock returns nearly eight times the 
market over fifteen years. 
THE STOCKDALE PARADOX 
Of course, not all good -to-great companies faced a dire crisis like Fannie 
Mae; fewer than half did. But every good -to-great company faced signifi - 
cant adversity along the way to greatness, of one sort or another -Gillette 
and the takeover battles, Nucor and imports, Wells Fargo and deregula - 
tion, Pitney Bowes losing its monopoly, Abbott Labs and a huge product 
recall, Kroger and the need to replace nearly 100 percent of its stores, and 
so forth. In every case, the management team responded with a powerful 
psychological duality. On the one hand, they stoically accepted the brutal 
facts of reality. On the other hand, they maintained an unwavering faith 
in the endgame, and a commitment to prevail as a great company despite 
the brutal facts. We came to call this duality the Stockdale Paradox. 
The name refers to Admiral Jim Stockdale, who was the highest- 
ranking United States military officer in the "Hanoi Hilton" prisoner -of- 
war camp during the height of the Vietnam War. Tortured over twenty 
times during his eight -year imprisonment from 1965 to 1973, Stockdale 
lived out the war without any prisoner's rights, no set release date, and no 
======================================== [Página 84] ========================================

certainty as to whether he would even survive to see his family again. He 
shouldered the burden of command, doing everything he could to create 
conditions that would increase the number of prisoners who would sur- 
vive unbroken, while fighting an internal war against his captors and their 
attempts to use the prisoners for propaganda. At one point, he beat himself 
with a stool and cut himself with a razor, deliberately disfiguring himself, 
so that he could not be put on videotape as an example of a "well-treated 
prisoner. " He exchanged secret intelligence information with his wife 
through their letters, knowing that discovery would mean more torture 
and perhaps death. He instituted rules that would help people to deal 
with torture (no one can resist torture indefinitely, so he created a step - 
wise system-after x minutes, you can say certain things -that gave the 
men milestones to survive toward). He instituted an elaborate internal 
communications system to reduce the sense of isolation that their captors 
tried to create, which used a five-by-five matrix of tap codes for alpha 
characters. (Tap -tap equals the letter a, tap-pause -tap-tap equals the letter 
b, tap-tap-pause -tap equals the letter f; and so forth, for twenty -five letters, 
c doubling in for k.) At one point, during an imposed silence, the prison - 
ers mopped and swept the central yard using the code, swish -swashing out 
"We love you " to Stockdale, on the third anniversary of his being shot 
down. After his release, Stockdale became the first three -star officer in the 
histor y of the navy to wear both aviator wings and the Congressional 
Medal of 
Honor.59 
You can understand, then, my anticipation at the prospect of spending 
part of an afternoon with Stockdale. One of my students had written his 
paper on Stockdale, who happened to be a senior research fellow studying 
the Stoic philosophers at the Hoover Institution right across the street from 
my office, and Stockdale invited the two of us for lunch. In preparation, I 
read In Love and War, the book Stockdale and his wife had written in alter- 
nating chapters, chronicling their experiences during those eight years. 
As I moved through the book, I found myself getting depressed. It just 
seemed so bleak- the uncertainty of his fate, the brutality of his captors, 
and so forth. And then, it dawned on me: "Here I am sitting in my warm 
and comfortable office, looking out over the beautiful Stanford campus 
on a beautiful Saturda y afternoon. I'm getting depressed reading this, and 
I know the end of the story! I know that he gets out, reunites with his fam- 
ily, becomes a national hero, and gets to spend the later years of his life 
studying philosophy on this same beautiful campus. If it feels depressing 
======================================== [Página 85] ========================================

Good to Great 85 
for me, how on earth did he deal with it when he was actually there and 
did not know the end of the story? " 
"I never lost faith in the end of the story, " he said, when I asked him. "I 
never doubted not only that I would get out, but also that I would prevail 
in the end and turn the experience into the defining event of my life, 
which, in retrospect, I would not trade. " 
I didn't say anything for many minutes, and we continued the slow walk 
toward the faculty club, Stockdale limping and arc-swinging his stiff leg 
that had never fully recovered from repeated torture. Finally, after about a 
hundred meters of silence, I asked, "Who didn't make it out?" 
"Oh, that's easy," he said. "The optimists. " 
"The optimists? I don't understand, " I said, now completely confused, 
given what he'd said a hundred meters earlier. 
"The optimists. Oh, they were the ones who said, 'We're going to be out 
by Christmas.' And Christmas would come, and Christmas would go. 
Then they'd say, 'We're going to be out by Easter.' And Easter would 
come, and Easter would go. And then Thanksgiving, and then it would be 
Christmas again. And they died of a broken heart. " 
Another long pause, and more walking. Then he turned to me and said, 
"This is a very important lesson. You must never confuse faith that you 
will prevail in the end-which you can never afford to lose-with the dis- 
cipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever 
they might be." 
To this day, I carry a mental image of Stockdale admonishing the opti- 
mists: "We're not getting out by Christmas; deal with it!" 
That conversation with Admiral Stockdale stayed with me, and in fact had 
a profound influence on my own development. Life is unfair-sometimes 
to our advantage, sometimes to our disadvantage. We will all experience 
disappointments and crushing events somewhere along the way, setbacks 
for which there is no "reason, " no one to blame. It might be disease; it 
might be injury; it might be an accident; it might be losing a loved one; it 
might be getting swept away in a political shake -up; it might be getting 
shot down over Vietnam and thrown into a POW camp for eight years. 
What separates people, Stockdale taught me, is not the presence or 
======================================== [Página 86] ========================================

86 Jim Collins 
absence of difficulty, but how they deal with the inevitable difficulties of 
life. In wrestling with life's challenges, the Stockdale Paradox (you must 
retain faith that you will prevail in the end and you must also confront the 
most brutal facts of your current reality) has proved powerful for coming 
back from difficulties not weakened, but stronger-not just for me, but for 
all those who've learned the lesson and tried to apply it. 
I never really considered my walk with Stockdale as part of my research 
into great companies, categorizing it more as a personal rather than cor- 
porate lesson. But as we unraveled the research evidence, I kept coming 
back to it in my own mind. Finally, one day during a research -team meet - 
ing, I shared the Stockdale story. There was silence around the table when 
I finished, and I thought, "They must think I'm really out in left field. " 
Then Duane Duffy, a quiet and thoughtful team member who had 
done the A&P versus Kroger analysis, said, "That's exactly what I've been 
struggling with. I've been trying to get my hands around the essential dif- 
ference between A&P and Kroger. And that's it. Kroger was like Stock - 
dale, and A&P was like the optimists who always thought they'd be out by 
Christmas. " 
Then other team members began to chime in, noting the same differ - 
ence between their comparison sets-Wells Fargo versus Bank of America 
both facing deregulation, Kimberly -Clark versus Scott Paper both facing 
the terrible might of Procter & Gamble, Pitney Bowes versus Addresso - 
graph both facing the loss of their monopolies, Nucor versus Bethlehem 
Steel both facing imports, and so forth. They all demonstrated this para- 
doxical psychological pattern, and we dubbed it the Stockdale Paradox. 
The Stockdale Paradox is a signature of all those who create greatness, 
be it in leading their own lives or in leading others. Churchill had it dur- 
ing the Second World War. Admiral Stockdale, like Viktor Frankl before 
him, lived it in a prison camp. And while our good -to-great companies 
cannot claim to have experienced either the grandeur of saving the free

world or the depth of personal experience of living in a POW camp, they 
all embraced the Stockdale Paradox. It didn't matter how bleak the situa- 
tion or how stultifying their mediocrity, they all maintained unwavering 
faith that they would not just survive, but prevail as a great company. And 
yet, at the same time, they became relentlessly disciplined at confronting 
the most brutal facts of their current reality. 
Like much of what we found in our research, the key elements of great - 
ness are deceptively simple and straightforward. The good -to-great leaders 
were able to strip away so much noise and clutter and just focus on the few 
things that would have the greatest impact. They were able to do so in 
large part because they operated from both sides of the Stockdale Paradox, 
never letting one side overshadow the other. If you are able to adopt this 
dual pattern, you will dramatically increase the odds of making a series of 
good decisions and ultimatel y discovering a simple, yet deeply insightful, 
concept for making the really big choices. And once you have that simple, 
unifying concept, you will be very close to making a sustained transition to 
breakthrough results. It is to the creation of that concept that we now turn.

CHAPTER 5 
Know thyself. 
-SCRIBES OF DELPHI, 
via Platol 
e you a hedgehog or a fox? 
famous essay "The Hedgehog and the Fox," Isaiah Berlin divided 
the world into hedgehogs and foxes, based upon an ancient Greek para- 
ble: "The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big 
thingp2 The fox is a cunning creature, able to devise a myriad of complex 
strategies for sneak attacks upon the hedgehog. Day in and day out, the fox 
circles around the hedgehog's den, waiting for the perfect moment to 
pounce. Fast, sleek, beautiful, fleet of foot, and crafty-the fox looks like 
the sure winner. The hedgehog, on the other hand, is a dowdier creature, 
looking like a genetic mix-up between a porcupine and a small armadillo. 
He waddles along, going about his simple day, searching for lunch and 
taking care of his home. 
The fox waits in cunning silence at the juncture in the trail. The hedge- 
hog, minding his own business, wanders right into the path of the fox. 
======================================== [Página 91] ========================================

Good to Great 91 
"Aha, I've got you now!" thinks the fox. He leaps out, bounding across the 
ground, lightning fast. The little hedgehog, sensing danger, looks up and 
thinks, "Here we go again. Will he ever learn? " Rolling up into a perfect 
little ball, the hedgehog becomes a sphere of sharp spikes, pointing out - 
ward in all directions. The fox, bounding toward his prey, sees the hedge - 
hog defense and calls off the attack. Retreating back to the forest, the fox 
begins to calculate a new line of attack. Each day, some version of this bat- 
tle between the hedgehog and the fox takes place, and despite the greater 
cunning of the fox, the hedgehog always wins. 
Berlin extrapolated from this little parable to divide people into two 
basic groups: foxes and hedgehogs. Foxes pursue many ends,at the same -- 
time and see 
the complexity. They are "scattered or diffused, 
moving on many levels, " says Berlin, never integrating their thinking into 
one overall concept or unifying vision. Hed~ehogs, on the other hand, 
simplify a complex world into a 
s&~e~~nki~gidea, a basic principle -or - - 
_-_~------------ - - 
concept that unifies andcguides - .-.- =--- everything. "-- -- - - It doesn't matter how complex 
the world, a hedgehog reduces all challenges and dilemmas to simple- 
indeed almost simplistic -hedgehog ideas. For a hedgehog, anything that 
does not somehow relate to the hedgehog idea holds no relevance. 
Princeton professor Marvin Bressler pointed out the power of the 
hedgehog during one of our long conversations: "You want to know what 
separates those who make the biggest impact from all the others who are 
just as smart? They're hedgehogs. " Freud and the unconscious, Darwin 
and natural selection, Marx and class struggle, Einstein and relativity, 
Adam Smith and division of labor-they were all hedgehogs. They took a 
complex world and simplified it. "Those who leave the biggest footprints, " 
said Bressler, "have thousands calling after them, 'Good idea, but you 
went too far!' "3 
To be clear, hedgehogs are not stupid. Quite the contrary. They under - 
stand that the essence of profound insight is simplicity. What could be 
more simple than e = mc2? What could be simpler than the idea of the 
unconscious, organized into an id, ego, and superego? What could be 
more elegant than Adam Smith's pin factory and "invisible hand"? No, 
the hedgehogs aren't simpletons; they have a piercing insight that allows 
them to see through complexity and discern underlying patterns. Hedge - 
hogs see what is essential, and ignore the rest. 
What does all this talk of hedgehogs and foxes have to do with good to 
great? Everything.

Consider the case of Walgreens versus Eckerd. Recall how Walgreens 
generated cumulative stock returns from the end of 1975 to 2000 that 
exceeded the market by over fifteen times, handily beating such great 
companies as GE, Merck, Coca -Cola, and Intel. It was a remarkable per- 
formance for such an anonymous -some might even say boring-com- 
pany. When interviewing Cork Walgreen, I kept asking him to go deeper, 
to help us understand these extraordinary results. Finally, in exasperation, 
he said, "Look, it just wasn't that complicated! Once we understood the 
concept, we just moved straight ahead.04 
What was the concept? Simply this: the best, most convenient drugstores, 
with high profit per customer visit. That's it. That's the breakthrough strat- 
egy that Walgreens used to beat Intel, GE, Coca -Cola, and Merck. 
In classic hedgehog style, Walgreens took this simple concept and imple - 
mented it with fanatical consistency. It embarked on a systematic program 
to replace all inconvenient locations with more convenient ones, preferably 
corner lots where customers could easily enter and exit from multiple direc - 
tions. If a great corner location would open up just half a block away from a 
profitable Walgreens store in a good location, the company would close the 
good store (even at a cost of $1 million to get out of the lease) to open a great 
new store on the 
c~rner.~ Walgreens pioneered drive -through pharmacies, 
found customers liked the idea, and built hundreds of them. In urban areas, 
the company clustered its stores tightly together, on the precept that no one 
should have to walk more than a few blocks to reach a%algreem6 In down - 
town San Francisco, for example, Walgreens clustered nine stores within a 
one-mile radius. Nine 
  store^!^ If you look closely, you will see Walgreens 
stores as densely packed in some cities as Starbucks coffee shops in Seattle. 
Walgreens then linked its convenience concept to a simple economic 
idea, profit per customer visit. Tight clustering (nine stores per mile!) 
leads to local economies of scale, which provides the cash for more clus- 
tering, which in turn draws more customers. By adding high-margin ser-

vices, like one-hour photo developing, Walgreens increased its profit per 
customer visit. More convenience led to more customer visits, which, 
when multiplied times increased profit per customer visit, threw cash 
back into the system to build even more convenient stores. Store by store, 
block by block, city by city, region by region, Walgreens became more and 
more of a hedgehog with this incredibly simple idea. 
In a world overrun by management faddists, brilliant visionaries, rant- 
ing futurists, fearmongers, motivational gurus, and all the rest, it's refresh - 
ing to see a company succeed so brilliantly by taking one simple concept 
and just doing it with excellence and imagination. Becoming the best in 
the world at convenient drugstores, steadil y increasing profit per customer 
visit-what could be more obvious and straightforward? 
Yet, if it was so obvious and straightforward, why 8dn.t Eckerd see it? 
While Walgreens stuck only to cities where it could implement the con- 
veniencelclustering concept, we found no evidence of a similarly coher - 
ent concept for growth at Eckerd. Deal makers to the core, Eckerd's 
executives compulsively leapt at opportunities to acquire clumps of 
stores-forty-two units here, thirty -six units there -in hodgepodge fash- 
ion, with no obvious unifying theme. 
======================================== [Página 94] ========================================

94 lim Collins 
While Walgreens executives understood that profitable growth would 
come by pruning away all that did not fit with the Hedgehog Concept, 
Eckerd executives lurched after growth for growth's sake. In the early 
1980s, just as Walgreens became religious about carrying out its conve - 
nient drugstore concept, Eckerd threw itself into the home video market 
with its purchase of American Home Video Corporation. Eckerd's CEO 
told Forbes magazine in 1981, "Some feel the purer we are the better we'll 
be. But I want growth, and the home video industry is only emerging- 
unlike, say, drugstore 
  chain^."^ Eckerd's home video foray produced $3 1 
million in losses before Eckerd sold it to Tandy, which crowed that it got 
the deal for $72 million below book 
 value.9 
In the precise year of Eckerd's American Home Video acquisition, 
Walgreens and Eckerd had virtually identical revenues ($1.7 billion). Ten 
years later, Walgreens had grown to over twice the revenues of Eckerd, 
accumulating net profits $1 billion greater than Eckerd over the decade. 
Twenty years later, Walgreens was going strong, as one of the most 
sustained transformations in our study. Meanwhile, Eckerd ceased to exist 
as an independent company.10 
THE THREE CIRCLES 
The notion of a Hedgehog Concept originated in our research team 
meetings when we were trying to make sense of Walgreens' spectacular 
returns. 
"Aren't we just talking about strategy? " I asked. "Convenient drugstores, 
profit per customer visit-isn't that just basic strategy? What's so interest - 
ing about that?" 
"But Eckerd also had strategy, " said Jenni Cooper, who analyzed the 
contrast between the two companies. "We can't say that it's just about hav- 
ing strategy. They both had strategy. " Jenni was correct in her observation. 
Strategy per se did not distinguish the good -to-great companies from the 
comparison companies. Both sets of companies had strgtegic plans, and 
there is absolutely no evidence that the good -to-great companies invested 
more time and energy in strategy development and long-range planning. 
"Okay, so are we just talking about good strategy versus bad strategy? " 
The team sat there for a minute, thinking. Then Leigh Wilbanks 
observed, "But what I find so striking is their incredible simplicity. I mean, 
look at Kroger with the superstore concept, or Kimberly -Clark with the 
======================================== [Página 95] ========================================

Good to Great 95 
move to paper -based consumer products, or Walgreens with convenient 
drugstores. These were simple, simple, simple ideas. " 
The research -team members all jumped into the fray, bantering about 
the companies they were studying. It soon became abundantly clear that 
all the good-to-great companies attained a very simple concept that they 
used as a frame of reference for all their decisions, and this understanding 
coincided with breakthrough results. Meanwhile, the comparison compa - 
nies like Eckerd got all tripped up by their snazzy strategies for growth. 
"Okay, " I pushed back, "but is simplicity enough? Just because it's simple 
doesn't mean it's right. The world is filled with failed companies that had 
simple but wrong ideas. " 
Then we decided to undertake a systematic look at the concepts that 
guided the good -to-great companies in contrast to the comparison compa - 
nies. After a few months of sifting and sorting, considering possibilities 
and tossing them out, we finally came to see that the Hedgehog Concept 
in each good-to-great company wasn't just any random simple idea. 
More precisely, a Hedgehog Concept is a simple, crystalline concept 
that flows fiom deep understanding about the intersection of the following 
three circles: 
1. What you can be the best in the world at (and, equally imp rtant, what P you cannot be the best in the world at). This discerning standard goes 
far beyond core competence. Just because you possess a core compe - 
tence doesn't necessarily mean you c'an be the best in the world at it. 
Conversely, what you can be the best at might not even be something 
in which you are currently engaged. 
2. What drives your economic engine. All the good -to-great companies 
attained piercing insight into how to most effectively generate sustained

and robust cash flow and profitability. In particular, they discovered the 
single denominator -profit per x -that had the greatest impact on their 
economics. (It would be cash flow per x in the social sector.) 
3. What you are deeply passionate about. The good -to-great companies 
focused on those activities that ignited their passion. The idea here is 
not to stimulate passion but to discover what makes you passionate. 
WHAT YOU ARE DEEPLY 
PASSIONATE ABOUT 
BE THE BEST IN 
THE WORLD AT 
To quickly grasp the three circles, consider the following personal anal- 
ogy. Suppose you were able to construct a work life that meets the following 
three tests. First, you are doing work for which you have a genetic or God- 
given talent, and perhaps you could become one of the best in the world in 
applying that talent. ("I feel that I was just born to be doing this.") Swond, 
you are well paid for what you do. ("I get paid to do this? Am I dreaming? ") 
Third, you are doing work you are passionate about and absolutely love to 
do, enjoying the actual process for its own sake. ("I look forward to getting 
up and throwing myself into my daily work, and I really believe in what I'm 
doing. ") If you could drive toward the intersection of these three circles and 
translate that intersection into a simple, crystalline concept that guided 
your life choices, then you'd have a Hedgehog Concept for yourself. 
======================================== [Página 97] ========================================

Good to Great 97 
To have a fully developed Hedgehog Concept, you need all three circles. 
If you make a lot of money doing things at which you could never be the 
best, you'll only build a successful company, not a great one. If you become 
the best at something, you'll never remain on top if you don't have intrinsic 
passion for what you are doing. Finally, you can be passionate all you want, 
but if you can't be the best at it or it doesn't make economic sense, then you 
might have a lot of fun, but you won't produce great results. 
UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU CAN 
(AND CANNOT) BE THE BEST AT 
"They stick with what they understand and let their abilities, not their egos, 
determine what they attempt. "" So wrote Warren Buffett about his $290 
million investment in Wells Fargo despite his serious reservations about 
the banking industry.'* Prior to clarifying its Hedgehog Concept, Wells 
Fargo had tried to be a global bank, operating like a mini-Citicorp, and a 
mediocre one at that. Then, at first under Dick Cooley and then under 
Carl Reichardt, Wells Fargo executives began to ask themselves a piercing 
set of questions: What can we potentially do better than any other com- 
pany, and, equally important, what can we not do better than any other 
company? And if we can't be the best at it, then why are we doing it at all? 
Putting aside their egos, the Wells Fargo team pulled the plug on the vast 
majority of its international operations, accepting the truth that it could not 
be better than Citicorp in global banking.13 Wells Fargo then turned its 
attention to what it could be the best in the world at: running a bank like a 
business, with a focus on the western United States. That's it. That was the 
essence of the Hedgehog Concept that turned Wells Fargo from a mediocre 
Citicorp wanna -be to one of the best-performing banks in the world. 
Carl Reichardt, CEO of Wells Fargo at the time of transition, stands as 
a consummate hedgehog. While his counterparts at Bank of America 
went into a reaction -revolution panic mode in response to deregulation, 
hiring change gurus who used sophisticated models and time -consusing 
encounter groups, Reichardt stripped everything down to its essential sim- 
plicity.14 "It's not space science stuff," he told us in our interview. "What 
we did was so simple, and we kept it simple. It was so straightforward and 
obvious that it sounds almost ridiculous to talk about it. The average busi - 
nessman coming from a highly competitive industry with no regulations 
would have jumped on this like a goose on a June bug."15 
======================================== [Página 98] ========================================

98 Jim Collins 
Reichardt kept people relentlessl y focused on the simple hedgehog 
idea, continually reminding them that "there's more money to be made in 
Modesto than 
 Tokyo."16 Those who worked with Reichardt marveled at 
his genius for simplicity. "If Carl were an Olympic diver, " said one of his 
colleagues, "he would not do a five-flip twisting thing. He would do the 
best swan dive in the world, and do it perfectly over and over again. "" 
The Wells Fargo focus on its Hedgehog Concept was so intense that it 
became, in its executives' own words, "a mantra. " Throughout our inter- 
views, Wells Fargo people echoed the same basic theme-"It wasn't that 
complicated. We just took a hard -nosed look at what we were doing and 
decided to focus entirely on those few things we knew we could do better 
than anyone else, not getting distracted into arenas that would feed our 
egos and at which we could not be the best." 
Every company would like to be the best at something, but few actually 
understand -with piercing insight and egoless clarity-what they actually 
have the potential to be the best at and, just as important, what they cannot 
be the best at. And it is this distinction that stands as one of the primary con- 
trasts between the good -to-great companies and the comparison companies. 
Consider the contrast between Abbott Laboratories and Upjohn. In 
1964, the two companies were almost identical in terms of revenues, prof- 
its, and product lines. Both companies had the bulk of their business in 
pharmaceuticals, principally antibiotics. Both companies had family 
management. Both companies lagged behind the rest of the pharmaceuti - 
cal industry. But then, in 1974, Abbott had a breakthrough in perfor - 
mance, producing cumulative returns of 4.0 times the market and 5.5 
times Upjohn over the next fifteen years. One crucial difference @tween 
the two companies is that Abbott developed a Hedgehog Concept based 
on what it could be the best at and Upjohn did not. 
Abbott began by confronting the brutal facts. By 1964, Abbott had lost 
the opportunity to become the best pharmaceutical company. While 
======================================== [Página 99] ========================================

Good to Great 99 
Abbott had drowsily lumbered along in the 1940s and 1950s, living off its 
cash cow, erythromycin, companies like Merck had built research engines 
that rivaled Harvard and Berkeley. By 1964, George Cain and his Abbott 
team realized that Merck and others had such a huge research lead that 
trying to be the best pharmaceutical company would be like a high school 
football team trying to take on the Dallas Cowboys. 
Even though Abbott's entire history lay in pharmaceuticals, becoming 
the best pharmaceutical company was no longer a viable option. So, 
guided by a Level 5 leader and tapping into the faith side of the Stockdale 
Paradox (There must be a way for us to prevail as a great company, and we 
will find it!), the Abbott team sought to understand what it could be the 
best at. Around 1967, a key insight emerged: We've lost the chance to be 
the best pharmaceutical company, but we have an opportunity to excel at 
creating products that contribute to cost-effective health care. Abbott had 
experimented with hospital nutritional products, designed to help patients 
quickly regain their strength after surgery, and diagnostic devices (one of 
the primary ways to reduce health care costs is through proper diagnosis). 
Abbott eventually became the number one company in both of these are- 
nas, which moved it far down the path of becoming the best company in 
the world at creating products that make health care more cost-effective.18 
Upjohn never confronted the same brutal reality and continued to live 
with the delusion that it could beat Merck.19 Later, when it fell even fur - 
ther behind the pharmaceutical leaders, it diversified into arenas where it 
definitely could not be the best in the world, such as plastics and chemi - 
cals. As Upjohn fell even further behind, it returned to a focus on ethical 
drugs, yet never confronted the fact that it was just too small to win in the 
big-stakes pharmaceutical 
 gameS2O Despite consistently spending nearly 
twice the percentage of sales on R&D as Abbott, Upjohn saw its profits 
dwindle to less than half those of Abbott before being acquired in 
 1995.21

Clearly, a Hedgehog Concept is not the same as a core competence. 
You can have competence at something but not necessaril y have the 
potential to be the best in the world at it. To use an analogy, consider the 
young person who gets straight A's in high school calculus and scores high 
on the math part of the SAT, demonstrating a core competence at mathe - 
matics. Does that mean the person should become a mathematician? Not 
necessarily. Suppose now that this young person goes off to college, 
enrolls in math courses, and continues to earn A's, yet encounters people 
who are genetically encoded for math. As one such student said after this 
experience, "It would take me three hours to finish the final. Then there 
were those who finished the same final in thirty minutes and earned an 
A+. Their brains are just wired differently. I could be a very competent 
mathematician, but I soon realized I could never be one of the best." That 
young person might still get pressure from parents and friends to continue 
with math, saying, "But you're so good at it." Just like our young person, 
many people have been pulled or have fallen into careers where they can 
never attain complete mastery and fulfillment. Suffering from the curse of 
competence but lacking a clear Hedgehog Concept, they rarel y become 
great at what they do. 
The Hedgehog Concept requires a severe standard of excellence. It's not 
just about building on strength and competence, but about understanding 
what your organization truly has the potential to be the very best at and 
sticking to it. Like Upjohn, the comparison companies stuck to businesses 
at which they were "good" but could never be the best, or worse, launched 
off in pursuit of easy growth and profits in arenas where they had no hope 
of being the best. They made money but never became great.

this principle and pinned their futures on allocating resources to those

few arenas where they could potentially be the best. (See the table below.) 
The comparison companies rarely attained this understanding. 
THE GOOD -TO-GREAT COMPANIES AND THE ''BEST IN THE

This table shows the understanding the good-to-great companies attained 
that formed the foundation of their shift from good to great. Note: This list 
does not show what the companies were already best in the world at when 
they began their transitions (most of these companies weren't the best at 
anything); rather, it shows what they came to understand they could become

Gillette: Could become 
the best at building premier 
global brands of daily 
necessities that require 
sophisticated manufacturing 
technology. Notes: Gillette saw that it had an unusual 
combination of two very different skills: 
(1) the ability to manufacture billions of 
low-cost, super -high-tolerance products 
(e.g., razor blades) and (2) the ability to 
build global consumer brands-the 
"Coke " of blades or toothbrushes. 
Kimberly -Clark: Could 
become the best in the 
world at paper-based 
consumer products. Notes: Kimberly-Clark realized that it 
had a latent skill at creating "category- 
killer " brands-brands where the name 
of the product is synonymous with the 
name of the category (e.g., Kleenex) - 
in paper-based products. 
Kroger: Could become the 
best at innovative super- 
combo stores. Notes: Kroger always had a strength in 
grocery store innovation. It took this skill 
and applied it to the question of how to 
create a combination store with many 
innovative, high-margin "mini-stores " 
under one roof. 
Nucor: Could become the 
best at harnessing culture 
and technology to produce 
low-cost steel. Notes: Nucor came to see that it had 
tremendous skill in two activities: 
(1) creating a performance culture 
and (2) making farsighted bets on new 
manufacturing technologies. 
By combining these two, it was able to 
become the lowest-cost steel 
producer in the United States. 
Philip Morris: Could 
become the best in the 
world at building brand 
loyalty in cigarettes and, 
later, other consumables. Notes: Early in transition, Philip Morris 
saw that it could become simply the 
best tobacco company in the world. 
Later, it began to diversify into non- 
tobacco arenas (a step taken by all tobacco 
companies, as a defensive measure), but 
stayed close to its brand-building strengths 
in "sinful " products (beer, tobacco, 
chocolate, coffee) and food products.

Pitney Bowes: Could 
become the best in the 
world at messaging that 
requires sophisticated back-

question of how to evolve beyond 
postage meters, it had two key 
insights about its strengths: (1) that 
it was not a postage company, but could 
have a broader definition (messaging) 
and (2) that it had particular strength in 
supplying the back rooms with sophisti- 
cated machines. 
Walgreens: Could become 
the best at convenient drug- 
stores. Notes: Walgreens saw that it was 
not just a drugstore but also a conven- 
ience store. It began systematically seek- 
ing the best sites for convenience-clus- 
tering many stores within a small radius 
and pioneering drive -through pharma- 
cies. It also made extensive investments 
in technology (including recent Web 
site developments), linking Walgreen 
stores worldwide to create one giant 
"corner pharmacy. " 
Wells Fargo: Could become 
the best at running a bank 
like a business, with a focus 
on the western United States. Notes: Wells came to two essential 
insights. First, most banks thought of 
themselves as banks, acted like banks, 
and protected the banker culture. Wells 
saw itself as a business that happened to 
be in banking. "Run it like a business " 
and "Run it like you own it " became 
mantras. Second, Wells recognized that 
it could not be the best in the world as a 
superglobal bank, but that it could be 
the best in the western United States.

INSIGHT INTO YOUR ECONOMIC ENGINE- 
WHAT IS YOUR DENOMINATOR? 
The good -to-great companies frequently produced spectacular returns in 
very unspectacular industries. The banking industry ranked in the bottom 
quartile of industries (in total retirns) during the same period that 
Wells Fargo beat the market by four times. Even more impressive, both 
Pitney Bowes and Nucor were in bottom 5 percent industries; yet both 
these companies beat the market by well over five times. Only one of the 
good -to-great companies had the benefit of being in a great industry 
(defined as a top 10 percent industry); five were in good industries; five 
were in bad to terrible industries. (See Appendix 5.A for a summary of 
industry analysis.) 
This is not a book on microeconomics. Each company and each indus - 
try had its own economic realities, and I'm not going to belabor them all 
here. The central point is that each good-to-great company attained a 
deep understanding of the key drivers in its economic engine and built its 
system in accordance with this understanding. 
That said, however, we did notice one particularly provocative form of 
economic insight that every good -to-great company attained, the notion of 
a single "economic denominator. " Think about it in terms of the follow - 
ing question: If you could pick one and only one ratio-profit per x (or, in 
the sociul sector, cash flow per x) -to systematically increase over time, what 
x would have the greatest and most sustainable impact on your economic 
engine? We learned that this single question leads to profound insight into 
the inner workings of an organization's economics. 
Recall how Walgreens switched its focus from profit per store to profit 
per customer visit. Convenient locations are expensive, but by increasing 
profit per customer visit, Walgreens was able to increase convenience 
(nine stores in a mile!) and simultaneously increase profitability across its 
& 
======================================== [Página 105] ========================================

Good to Great 10s 
entire system. The standard metric of profit per store would have run con- 
trary to the convenience concept. (The quickest way to increase profit per 
store is to decrease the number of stores and put them in less expensive 
locations. This would have destro yed the convenience concept.) 
Or consider Wells Fargo. When the Wells team confronted the brutal 
fact that deregulation would transform banking into a commodity, they 
realized that standard banker metrics, like profit per loan and profit per 
deposit, would no longer be the key drivers. Instead, they grasped a new 
denominator: profit per employee. Following this logic, Wells Fargo 
became one of the first banks to change its distribution system to rely pri - 
marily on stripped -down branches and ATMs. 
The denominator can be quite subtle, sometimes even unobvious. The 
key is to use the question of the denominator to gain understand~ng 
and insight into your economic model. 
For example, Fannie Mae grasped the subtle denominator of profit per 
mortgage risk level, not per mortgage (which would be the "obvious " 
choice). It's a brilliant insight. The real driver in Fannie Mae's economics 
is the ability to understand risk of default in a package of mortgages better 
than anyone else. Then it makes money selling insurance and managing 
the spread on that risk. Simple, insightful, unobvious -and right. 
Nucor, for example, made its mark in the ferociously price competitive 
steel industry with the denominator profit per ton of finished steel. At first 
glance, you might think that per employee or per fixed cost might be the 
proper denominator. But the Nucor people understood that the driving 
force in its economic engine was a combination of a strong -work -ethic 
culture and the application of advanced manufacturing technology. Profit 
per employee or per fixed cost would not capture this duality as well as 
profit per ton of finished steel. 
Do you need to have a single denominator? No, but pushing for a sin - 
gle denominator tends to produce better insight than letting yourself off 
the hook with three or four denominators. The denominator question 
serves as a mechanism to force deeper understanding of the key drivers in 
your economic engine. As the denominator question emerged from the 
research, we tested the question on a number of executive teams. We 
found that the question always stimulated intense dialogue and debate. 
======================================== [Página 106] ========================================

10s lim Collins 
Furthermore, even in cases where the team failed (or refused) to identify 
a single denominator, the challenge of the question drove them to deeper 
insight. And that is, after all, the point-to have a denominator not for the 
sake of having a denominator, but for the sake of gaining insight that ulti- 
mately leads to more robust and sustainable economics. 
This table shows the economic denominator insight attained by the good-to- 
great companies during the pivotal transition years.

uct line to profit per employee fit with 
the idea of contributing to cost-effective 
health care. 
Circuit City: per

store to profit per region reflected local 
economies of scale. While per-store per-

grouping was a key insight that drove

All the good -to-great companies discovered a key economic denomina - 
tor (see the table on page 106), while the comparison companies usually 
did not. In fact, we found only one comparison case that attained a pro- 
found insight into its economics. Hasbro built its upswing on the insight 
that a portfolio of classic toys and games, such as G.I. Joe and Monopoly, 
produces more sustainable cash flow than big onetime hits.23 In fact, Has- 
bro is the one comparison company that understood all three circles of the 
Hedgehog Concept. It became the best in the world at acquiring and 
renewing tried-and-true toys, reintroducing and recycling them at just the 
right time to increase profit per classic brand. And its people had great pas- 
sion for the business. Systematically building from all three circles, Has- 
bro became the best-performing comparison in our study, lending further 
credence to the power of the Hedgehog Concept. 
Hasbro became an unsustained transition in part because it lost the dis- 
cipline to stay within the three circles, after the unexpected death of CEO 
Stephen Hassenfeld. The Hasbro case reinforces a vital lesson. If you suc- 
cessfully apply these ideas, but then stop doing them, you will slide back - 
ward, from great to good, or worse. The only way to remain great is to keep 
applying the findamental principles that made you great. 
UNDERSTANDING YOUR PASSION 
When interviewing the Philip Morris executives, we encountered an 
intensity and passion that surprised us. Recall from chapter 3 how George 
Weissman described working at the company as the great love affair of his 
life, second only to his marriage. Even with a most sinful collection of 
consumer products (Marlboro cigarettes, Miller beer, 67 percent fat-filled 
Velveeta, Maxwell House coffee for caffeine addicts, Toblerone for choco - 
holics, and so forth), we found tremendous passion for the business. Most 
of the top executives at Philip Morris were passionate consumers of their 
own products. In 1979, Ross Millhiser, then vice chairman of Philip Mor- 
ris and a dedicated smoker, said, "I love cigarettes. It's one of the things 
that makes life really worth 
 living."24 
The Philip Morris people clearly loved their company and had passion 
for what they were doing. It's as if they viewed themselves as the lone, 
fiercely independent cowboy depicted in the Marlboro billboards. "We 
have a right to smoke, and we will protect that right!" A board member 
told me during my research for a previous project, "I really love being on

around you. the board of Philip Morris. It's like being part of something really special. " 
She said this as she proudly puffed 
 away.25 
Now, you might say, "But that is just the defensiveness of the tobacco 
industry. Of course they'd feel that way. Otherwise, how could they sleep 
at night? " But keep in mind that R. J. Reynolds was also in the tobacco 
business and under siege from society. Yet, unlike Philip Morris, R. J. 
Reynolds executives began to diversify away from tobacco into any arena 
where it could get growth, regardless of whether they had passion for those 
acquisitions or whether the company could be the best in the world at 
them. The Philip Morris people stuck much closer to the tobacco busi- 
ness, in large part because they loved that business. In contrast, the R. J. 
Reynolds people saw tobacco as just a way to make money. As vividly 
portrayed in the book Barbarians at the Gate, R. J. Reynolds executives 
eventually lost passion for anything except making themselves rich 
through a leveraged 
 buyout.26 ' 
It may seem odd to talk about something as soft and fuzzy as "passion " as 
an integral part of a strategic framework. But throughout the good -to- 
When Gillette executives made the choice to build sophisticated, rela- 
tively expensive shaving systems rather than fight a low -margin battle with 
disposables, they did so in large part because they just couldn't get excited 
about cheap disposable razors. "Zeien talks about shaving systems with 
the sort of technical gusto one expects from a Boeing or Hughes engi- 
neer," wrote one journalist about Gillette's CEO in 
1996.28 Gillette has 
always been at its best when it sticks to businesses that fit its Hedgehog great companies, passion became a key part of the Hedgehog Concept.

Concept. "People who aren't passionate about Gillette need not apply, " 
wrote a Wall Street Journal reporter, who went on to describe how a top 
business school graduate wasn't hired because she didn't show enough 
passion for 
 deodorant.29 
Perhaps you, too, can't get passionate about deodorant. Perhaps you 
might find it hard to imagine being passionate about pharmacies, grocery 
stores, tobacco, or postage meters. You might wonder about what type of 
person gets all jazzed up about making a bank as efficient as McDonald's, 
or who considers a diaper charismatic. In the end, it doesn't really matter. 
The point is that they felt passionate about what they were doing and the 
passion was deep and genuine. 
This doesn't mean, however, that you have to be passionate about the 
mechanics of the business per se (although you might be). The passion 
circle can be focused equally on what the company stands for. For exam - 
ple, the Fannie Mae people were not passionate about the mechanical 
process of packaging mortgages into market securities. But they were 
terrifically motivated by the whole idea of helping people of all classes, 
backgrounds, and races realize the American dream of owning their home. 
Linda Knight, who joined Fannie Mae in 1983, just as the company faced 
its darkest days, told us: "This wasn't just any old company getting into 
trouble; this was a company at the core of making home ownership a real- 
ity for thousands of Americans. It's a role that is far more important than 
just making money, and that's why we felt such depth of commitment to 
preserve, protect, and enhance the 
company."30 As another Fannie Mae 
executive summed up, "I see us as a key mechanism for strengthening the 
whole social fabric of America. Whenever I drive through difficult neigh - 
borhoods that are coming back because more families own their homes, I 
return to work reenergized. " 
THE TRIUMPH OF UNDERSTANDING 
OVER BRAVADO 
On the research team, we frequently found ourselves talking about the dif- 
ference between "prehedgehog " and "posthedgehog " states. In the pre- 
hedgehog state, it's like groping through the fog. You're making progress 
on a long march, but you can't see all that well. At each juncture in the 
trail, you can only see a little bit ahead and must move at a deliberate, 
slow crawl. Then, with the Hedgehog Concept, you break into a clearing, 
======================================== [Página 111] ========================================

Good to Great 111 
the fog lifts, and you can see for miles. From then on, each juncture 
requires less deliberation, and you can shift from crawl to walk, and from 
walk to run. In the posthedgehog state, miles of trail move swiftly beneath 
your feet, forks in the road fly past as you quickly make decisions that you 
could not have seen so clearly in the fog. 
What's so striking about the comparison companies is that-for all their 
change programs, frantic gesticulations, and charismatic leaders-they 
rarely emerged from the fog. They would try to run, making bad decisions 
at forks in the road, and then have to reverse course later. Or they would 
veer off the trail entirely, banging into trees and tumbling down 
ravines.(Oh, but they were sure doing it with speed and panache!) 
Nowhere is this more evident than in the comparison companies' 
mindless pursuit of growth: Over two thirds of the comparison companies 
displayed an obsession with growth without the benefit of a Hedgehog 
Concept.31 Statements such as "We've been a growth at any price com- 
pany" and "Betting that size equals success7' pepper the materials on the 
comparison companies. In contrast, not one of the good -to-great compa - 
nies focused obsessively on growth. Yet they created sustained, profitable 
growth far greater than the comparison companies that made growth their 
mantra. 
Consider the case of Great Western and Fannie Mae. "Great Western is 
a mite unwieldy, " wrote the Wall Street Transcript. "It wants to grow 
everyway it 
can."32 The company found itself in finance, leasing, insur - 
ance, and manufactured houses, continually acquiring companies in an 
expansion 
 binge.33 Bigger! More! In 1985, Great Western's CEO told a 
gathering of analysts, "Don't worry about what you call us-a bank, an 
S&L, or a 
Zebra."34 
Quite a contrast to Fannie Mae, which had a simple, crystalline under - 
standing that it could be the best capital markets player in anything

related to mortgages, better even than Goldman Sachs or Salomon Broth - 
ers in opening up the full capital markets to the mortgage process. It built 
a powerful economic machine by reframing its business model on risk 
management, rather than mortgage selling. And it drove the machine 
with great passion, the Fannie Mae people inspired by its vital role in 
democratizing home ownership. 
Until 1984, the stock charts tracked each other like mirror images. Then 
in 1984, one year after it clarified its Hedgehog Concept, Fannie Mae 
exploded upward, while Great Western kept lollygagging along until just 
before its acquisition in 1997. By focusing on its simple, elegant concep - 
tion-and not just focusing on "growth "-Fannie Mae grew revenues 
nearly threefold from its transition year in 1984 through 1996. Great West - 
ern, for all of its gobbling of growth steroids, grew revenues and earnings 
only 25 percent over the same period, then lost its independence in 1997. 
The Hedgehog Concept is a turning point in the journey from good 
to great. In most cases, the transition date follows within a few years of 
the Hedgehog Concept. Furthermore, everything from here on out in 
the book hinges upon having the Hedgehog Concept. As will become 
abundantly clear in the following chapters, disciplined action-the 
third big chunk in the framework after disciplined people and disci - 
plined thought -only makes sense in the context of the Hedgehog 
Concept. 
Despite its vital importance (or, rather, because of its vital importance), 
it would be a terrible mistake to thoughtlessly attempt to jump right to a 
Hedgehog Concept. You can't just go off-site for two days, pull out a 
bunch of flip charts, do breakout discussions, and come up with a deep 
understanding. Well, you can do that, but you probably won't get it right. 
It would be like Einstein saying, "I think it's time to become a great scien - 
tist, so I'm going to go off to the Four Seasons this weekend, pull out the 
flip charts, and unlock the secrets of the universe. " Insight just doesn't

get the theory of special relativity, and he was a bright

It took about four years on average for the good-to -great companies to 
clarify their Hedgehog Concepts. Like scientific insight, a Hedgehog 
Concept simplifies a complex world and makes decisions much easier. 
But while it has crystalline clarity and elegant simplicity once you have it, 
getting the concept can be devilishly difficult and takes time. Recognize 
that getting a Hedgehog Concept is an inherently iterative process, not an 
event. 
The essence of the process is to get the right people engaged in vigorous 
dialogue and debate, infused with the brutal facts and guided by questions 
formed by the three circles. Do we really understand what we can be the 
best in the world at, as distinct from what we can just be successful at? Do 
we really understand the drivers in our economic engine, including our 
economic denominator? Do we really understand what best ignites our 
passion?

device that we came to call the Council. The Council consists of a group 
of the right people who participate in dialogue and debate guided by the 
three circles, iteratively and over time, about vital issues and decisions fac- 
ing the organization. (See "Characteristics of the Council, " below.) 
In response to the question, "How should we go about getting our 
Hedgehog Concept? " I' would point to the diagram on page 114 and say: 
"Build the Council, and use that as a model. Ask the right questions, 
engage in vigorous debate, make decisions, autopsy the results, and 
learn-all guided within the context of the three circles. Just keep going 
through that cycle of understanding. " 
When asked, "How do we accelerate the process of getting a Hedgehog 
Concept? " I would respond: "Increase the number of times you go around 
that full cycle in a given period of time." If you go through this cycle 
enough times, guided resolutely by the three circles, you will eventually 
gain the depth of understanding required for a Hedgehog Concept. It will 
not happen overnight, but it will eventually happen.

Does every organization have a Hedgehog Concept to discover? What 
if you wake up, look around with brutal honesty, and conclude: "We're 
not the best at anything, and we never have been. " Therein lies one of the 
most exciting aspects of the entire study. In the majority of cases, the good - 
to-great companies were not the best in the world at anything and showed 
no prospects of becoming so. Infused with the Stockdale Paradox ("There 
must be something we can become the best at, and we will find it! We 
must also confront the brutal facts of what we cannot be the best at, and 
we will not delude ourselves! "), every good -to-great company, no matter 
how awful at the start of the process, prevailed in its search for a Hedgehog 
Concept. 
As you search for your own concept, keep in mind that when the good - 
to-great companies finally grasped their Hedgehog Concept, it had none 
of the tiresome, irritating blasts of mindless bravado typical of the compar - 
ison companies. "Yep, we could be the best at that" was stated as the 
recognition of a fact, no more startling than observing that the sky is blue 
or the grass is green. When you get your Hedgehog Concept right, it has 
the quiet ping of truth, like a single, clear, perfectl y struck note hanging in 
the air in the hushed silence of a full auditorium at the end of a quiet 
movement of a Mozart piano concerto. There is no need to say much of 
anything; the quiet truth speaks for itself. 
I'm reminded of a personal experience in my own family that illustrates 
the vital difference between bravado and understanding. My wife, Joanne, 
began racing marathons and triathlons in the early 1980s. As she accumu - 
lated experience -track times, swim splits, race results -she began to feel 
======================================== [Página 117] ========================================

11 Good to Great 117 
the momentum of success. One day, she entered a race with many of the 
best woman triathletes in the world, and-despite a weak swim where she 
came out of the water hundreds of places behind the top swimmers and 
having to push a heavy, nonaerodynamic bike up a long hill -she man- 
aged to cross the finish line in the top ten. 
Then, a few weeks later while sitting at breakfast, Joanne looked up 
from her morning newspaper and calmly, quietly said, "I think I could 
win the Ironman. " 
The Ironman, the world championship of triathlons, involves 2.4 miles 
of ocean swimming and 112 miles of cycling, capped off with a 26.2 -mile 
marathon footrace on the hot, lava-baked Kona coast of Hawaii. 
"Of course, I'd have to quit my job, turn down my offers to graduate 
school (she had been admitted to graduate business school at a number of 
the top schools), and commit to full-time training. But . . ." 
Her words had no bravado in them, no hype, no agitation, no pleading. 
She didn't try to convince me. She simply observed what she had come to 
understand was a fact, a truth no more shocking than stating that the walls 
were painted white. She had the passion. She had the genetics. And if she 
won races, she'd have the economics. The goal to win the Ironman flowed 
from early understanding of her Hedgehog Concept. 
And, so, she decided to go for it. She quit her job. She turned down 
graduate schools. She sold the mills! (But she did keep me on her bus.) 
And three years later, on a hot October day in 1985, she crossed the finish 
line at the Hawaii Ironman in first place, world champion. When Joanne 
set out to win the Ironman, she did not know if she would become the 
world's best triathlete. But she understood that she could, that it was in the 
realm of possibility, that she was not living in a delusion. And that distinc - 
tion makes all the difference. It is a distinction that those who want to go 
from good to great must grasp, and one that those who fail to become

In 1980, George Rathmann cofounded the biotechnology company 
Amgen. Over the next twenty years, Amgen grew from a struggling entre - 
preneurial enterprise into a $3.2 billion company with 6,400 employees, 
creating blood products to improve the lives of people suffering through 
chemotherapy and kidney 
 dialysis.2 Under Rathmann, Amgen became 
one of the few biotechnology companies that delivered consistent prof- 
itability and growth. It became so consistently profitable, in fact, that its 
stock price multiplied over 150 times from its public offering in June 1983 
to January 2000. An investor who bought as little as $7,000 ofAmgen stock 
would have realized a capital gain of over $1 million, thirteen times better 
than the same investment in the general stock market.

they respond to growth and success in the wrong way. Entrepreneurial 
I success is fueled by creativity, imagination, bold moves into uncharted 
waters, and visionary zeal. As a company grows and becomes more com - 
plex, it begins to trip over its own success -too many new people, too 
many new customers, too many new orders, too many new products. 
1 What was once great fun becomes an unwieldy ball of disorganized stuff. 
Lack of planning, lack of accounting, lack of systems, and lack of hiring 
constraints create friction. Problems surface-with customers, with cash 
flow, with schedules. 
In response, someone (often a board member) says, "It's time to grow up. 
This place needs some professional management. " The company begins to 
hire MBAs and seasoned executives from blue-chip companies. Processes, 
procedures, checklists, and all the rest begin to sprout up like weeds. What 
was once an egalitarian environment gets replaced with a hierarchy. 
I Chains of command appear for the first time. Reporting relationships 
become clear, and an executive class with special perks begins to appear. 
"We" and "they" segmentations appear- just like in a real company. 
The professional managers finally rein in the mess. They create order 
out of chaos, but they also kill the entrepreneurial spirit. Members of the 
founding team begin to grumble, "This isn't fun anymore. I used to be 
able to just get things done. Now I have to fill out these stupid forms and 
follow these stupid rules. Worst of all, I have to spend a horrendous 
amount of time in useless meetings. " The creative magic begins to wane 
as some of the most innovative people leave, disgusted by the burgeoning 
bureaucracy and hierarchy. The exciting start -up transforms into just 
another company, with nothing special to recommend it. The cancer of 
mediocrity begins to grow in earnest. 
George Rathmann avoided this entrepreneurial death spiral. He under - 
stood that the purpose of bureaucracy is to compensate for incompetence 
and lack of discipline -a problem that largely goes away if you have the 
right people in the first place. Most companies build their bureaucratic 
rules to manage the small percentage of wrong people on the bus, which 
in turn drives away the right people on the bus, which then increases the 
percentage of wrong people on the bus, which increases the need for 
more bureaucracy to compensate for incompetence and lack of disci- 
pline, which then further drives the right people away, and so forth. Rath- 
mann also understood an alternative exists: Avoid bureaucracy and 
hierarchy and instead create a culture of discipline. When you put these 
two complementary forces together -a culture of discipline with an ethic

Why start this chapter with a biotechnology entrepreneur rather than 
one of our good -to-great companies? Because Rathmann credits much of 
his entrepreneurial success to what he learned while working at Abbott 
Laboratories before founding Amgen: 
What I got from Abbott was the idea that when you set your objectives for 
the year, you record them in concrete. You can change your plans 
through the year, but you never change what you measure yourself 
against. You are rigorous at the end of the year, adhering exactly to what 
you said was going to happen. You don't get a chance to editorialize. You 
don't get a chance to adjust and finagle, and decide that you really didn't 
intend to do that anyway, and readjust your objectives to make yourself 
look better. You never just focus on what you've accomplished for the 
year; you focus on what you've accomplished relative to exactly what you 
said you were going to accomplish -no matter how tough the measure. 
That was a discipline learned at Abbott, and that we carried into 
 Amgen.j 
======================================== [Página 123] ========================================

Good to Great 123 
Many of the Abbott disciplines trace back to 1968, when it hired a 
remarkable financial officer named Bernard H. Semler. Semler did not see 
his job as a traditional financial controller or accountant. Rather, he set out 
to invent mechanisms that would drive cultural change. He created a whole 
new framework of accounting that he called Responsibility Accounting, 
wherein every item of cost, income, and investment would be clearly identi - 
fied with a single individual responsible for that item.4 The idea, radical for 
the 1960s, was to create a system wherein every Abbott manager in every type 
of job was responsible for his or her return on investment, with the same 
rigor that an investor holds an entrepreneur responsible. There would be no 
hiding behind traditional accounting allocations, no slopping funds about 
to cover up ineffective management, no opportunities for 
finger-pointing.5 
But the beauty of the Abbott system lay not just in its rigor, but in how it 
used rigor and discipline - to enable creativity and entrepreneurship. 
"Abbott developed a very disciplined organization, but not in a linear way 
of thinking, " said George Rathmann. "[It] was exemplary at having both 
financial discipline and the divergent thinking of creative work. We used 
financial discipline as a way to provide resources for the really creative 
work."6 Abbott reduced its administrative costs as a percentage of sales to 
the lowest in the industry (by a significant margin) and at the same time 
became a new product innovation machine like 3M, deriving up to 65 per- 
cent of revenues from new products introduced in the previous four 
 years.7 
This creative duality ran through every aspect of Abbott during the tran- 
sition era, woven into the very fabric of the corporate culture. On the one 
hand, Abbott recruited entrepreneurial leaders and gave them freedom to 
determine the best path to achieving their objectives. On the other hand, 
individuals had to commit fully to the Abbott system and were held rigor - 
ously accountable for their objectives. They had freedom, but freedom 
within a framework. Abbott instilled the entrepreneur's zeal for oppor - 
tunistic flexibility. ( "We recognized that planning is priceless, but plans 
\ are useless, " said one Abbott exec~tive.)~ But Abbott also had the disci- 
pline to say no to opportunities that failed the three circles test. While 
encouraging wide -ranging innovation within its divisions, Abbott simulta - 
neously maintained fanatical adherence to its Hedgehog Concept of con- 
tributing to cost-effective health care. 
Abbott Laboratories exemplifies a key finding of our study: a culture of 
discipline. By its nature, "culture " is a somewhat unwieldy topic to discuss, 
less prone to clean frameworks like the three circles. The main points of 
this chapter, however, boil down to one central idea: Build a culture hll of

FREEDOM (AND RESPONSIBILITY) 
WITHIN A FRAMEWORK 
Picture an airline pilot. She settles into the cockpit, surrounded by dozens 
of complicated switches and sophisticated gauges, sitting atop a massive 
$84 million piece of machinery. As passengers thump and stuff their bags 
into overhead bins and flight attendants scurry about trying to get every - 
one settled in, she begins her preflight checklist. Step by methodical step, 
she systematically moves through every required item. 
Cleared for departure, she begins working with air traffic control, fol- 
lowing precise instructions -which direction to take out of the gate, which 
way to taxi, which runway to use, which direction to take off. She doesn't 
throttle up and hurtle the jet into the air until she's cleared for takeoff. 
Once aloft, she communicates continually with flight -control centers and 
stays within the tight boundaries of the commercial air traffic system. 
On approach, however, she hits a ferocious thunder -and-hail storm. Blast- 
ing winds, crossways and unpredictable, tilt the wings down to the left, then 
down to the right. Looking out the windows, passengers can't see the ground, 
only the thinning and thickening globs of gray clouds and the spatter of rain 
on the windows. The flight attendants announce, "Ladies and gentlemen, 
we've been asked to remain seated for the remainder of the flight. Please put 
your seats in the upright and locked position and place all your carry -on bag- 
gage under the seat in front of you. We should be on the ground shortl y."

"Not too shortly, I hope, " think the less experienced travelers, unnerved 
by the roiling wind and momentary flashes of lightning. But the experi - 
enced travelers just go on reading magazines, chatting with seatmates, and 
preparing for their meetings on the ground. "I've been through all this 
before, " they think. "She'll only land if it's safe." 
Sure enough, on final approach -wheels down as a quarter of a million 
pounds of steel glides down at 130 miles per hour-passengers suddenly 
hear the engines whine and feel themselves thrust back into their seats. 
The plane accelerates back into the sky. It banks around in a big arc back 
toward the airport. The pilot takes a moment to click on the intercom: 
"Sorry, folks. We were getting some bad crosswinds there. We're going to 
give it another try." On the next go, the winds calm just enough and she 
brings the plane down, safely. 
Now take a step back and think about the model here. The pilot oper - 
ates within a very strict system, and she does not have freedom to go out- 
side of that system. (You don't want airline pilots saying, "Hey, I just read 
in a management book about the value of being empowered -freedom to 
experiment, to be creative, to be entrepreneurial, to try a lot of stuff and 
keep what works! ") Yet at the same time, the crucial decisions -whether 
to take off, whether to land, whether to abort, whether to land else- 
where-rest with the pilot. Regardless of the strictures of the system, one 
central fact stands out above all others: The pilot has ultimate responsibil - 
ity for the airplane and the lives of the people on it. 
The point here is not that a company should have a system as strict and 
inflexible as the air traffic system. After all, if a corporate system fails, peo- 
ple don't die by the hundreds in burning, twisted hunks of steel. Cus- 
tomer service at the airlines might be terrible, but you are almost certain 
to get where you are going in one piece. The point of this analogy is that 
when we looked inside the good -to-great companies, we were reminded of 
the best part of the airline pilot model: freedom and responsibility within 
the framework of a highly developed system.

"This was the secret to how we were able to run stores from a great dis- 
tance, by remote control, " said Bill Rivas of Circuit City. "It was the com- 
bination of great store managers who had ultimate responsibility for their 
individual stores, operating within a great system. You've got to have man- 
agement and people who believe in the system and who do whatever is 
necessary to make the system work. But within the boundaries of that sys- 
tem, store managers had a lot of leeway, to coincide with their responsibil- 
ity."9 In a sense, Circuit City became to consumer electronics retailing 
what McDonald's became to restaurants -not the most exquisite experi - 
ence, but an enormously consistent one. The system evolved over time as 
Circuit City experimented by adding new items like computers and video 
players (just like McDonald's added breakfast Egg McMuffins). But at any 
given moment, everyone operated within the framework of the system. 
"That's one of the major differences between us and all the others who 
were in this same business in the early 1980~~" said Bill Zierden. "They 
just couldn't roll itzut further, and we could. We could stamp these stores 
out all over the country, with great 
 consist en^^."'^ Therein lies one of the 
key reasons why Circuit City took off in the early 1980s and beat the gen- 
eral stock market by more than eighteen times over the next fifteen years. 
In a sense, much of this book is about creating a culture of discipline. It 
all starts with disciplined people. The transition begins not by trying to dis- 
cipline the wrong people into the right behaviors, but by getting self- 
disciplined people on the bus in the first place. Next we have disciplined 
thought. You need the discipline to confront the brutal facts of reality, 
while retaining resolute faith that you can and will create a path to great - 
ness. Most importantly, you need the discipline to persist in the search for 
understanding until you get your Hedgehog Concept. Finally, we have 
disciplined action, the primary subject of this chapter. This order is 
important. The comparison companies often tried to jump right to disci- 
plined action. But disciplined action without self-disciplined people is 
impossible to sustain, and disciplined action without disciplined thought 
is a recipe for disaster. 
Indeed, discipline by itself will not produce great results. We find 
plenty of organizations in history that had tremendous discipline and that 
marched right into disaster, with precision and in nicely formed lines. No, 
the point is to first get self-disciplined people who engage in very rigorous 
thinking, who then take disciplined action within the framework of a con- 
sistent system designed around the Hedgehog Concept.

RINSING YOUR COTTAGE CHEESE 
Throughout our research, we were struck by the continual use of words 
like disciplined, rigorous, dogged, determined, diligent, precise, fastidious, 
systematic, methodical, workmanlike, demanding, consistent, focused, 
accountable, and responsible. They peppered articles, interviews, and 
source materials on the good -to-great companies, and were strikingly 
absent from the materials on the direct comparison companies. People in 
the good -to-great companies became somewhat extreme in the fulfillment 
of their responsibilities, bordering in some cases on fanaticism. 
We came to call this the "rinsing your cottage cheese " factor. The anal- 
ogy comes from a disciplined world -class athlete named Dave Scott, who 
won the Hawaii Ironman Triathlon six times. In training, Scott would ride 
his bike 75 miles, swim 20,000 meters, and run 17 miles-on average, 
every single day. Dave Scott did not have a weight problem! Yet he 
believed that a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet would give him an extra 
edge. So, Dave Scott-a man who burned at least 5,000 calories a day 
in training -would literally rinse his cottage cheese to get the extra fat 
off. Now, there is no evidence that he absolutely needed to rinse his 
cottage cheese to win the Ironman; that's not the point of the story. The 
point is that rinsing his cottage cheese was simply one more small step 
that he believed would make him just that much better, one more small 
step added to all the other small steps to create a consistent program 
of superdiscipline. I've always pictured Dave Scott running the 26 miles 
of the marathon -hammering away in hundred -degree heat on the black, 
baked lava fields of the Kona coast after swimming 2.4 miles in the ocean 
and cycling 112 miles against ferocious crosswinds -and thinking to

himself: "Compared to rinsing my cottage cheese every day, this just isn't 
that bad." 
I realize that it's a bizarre analogy. But in a sense, the good -to-great com- 
panies became like Dave Scott. Much of the answer to the question of 
"good to great" lies in the discipline to do whatever it takes to become the 
best within carefully selected arenas and then to seek continual improve - 
ment from there. It's really just that simple. And it's really just that difficult. 
Consider Wells Fargo in contrast to Bank of America. Carl Reichardt 
never doubted that Wells Fargo could emerge from bank deregulation as a 
stronger company, not a weaker one. He saw that the key to becoming a 
great company rested not with brilliant new strategies but-with the sheer 
determination to rip a hundred years of banker mentality out of the sys- 
tem. "There's too much waste in banking, " said Reichardt. "Getting rid of 
it takes tenacity, not brilliance. "" 
Reichardt set a clear tone at the top: We're not going to ask everyone else 
to suffer while we sit on high. We will start by rinsing our own cottage cheese, 
right here in the executive suite. He froze executive salaries for two years 
(despite the fact that Wells Fargo was enjoying some of the most profitable 
years in its history).12 He shut the executive dining room and replaced it 
with a college dorm food-service caterer.13 He closed the executive elevator, 
sold the corporate jets, and banned green plants from the executive suite as 
too expensive to water.14 He removed free coffee from the executive suite. 
He eliminated Christmas trees for management.15 He threw reports back at 
people who'd submitted them in fancy binders, with the admonishment: 
"Would you spend your own money this way? What does a binder add to 
anything?"16 Reichardt would sit through meetings with fellow executives, 
in a beat-up old chair with the stuffing hanging out. Sometimes he would 
just sit there and pick at the stuffing while listening to proposals to spend 
money, said one article, "[and] a lot of must -do projects just melted away."17 
Across the street at Bank of America, executives also faced deregulation 
and recognized the need to eliminate waste. However, unlike Wells Fargo,

ing panorama of the San Francisco Bay from the Golden Gate to the Bay 
Bridge."18 (We found no evidence of executive chairs with the stuffing 
hanging out.) The elevator made its last stop at the executive floor and 
descended all the way to the ground in one quiet whoosh, unfettered by 
the intrusions of lesser beings. The vast open space in the executive suite 
made the windows look even taller than they actually were, creating a 
sense of floating above the fog in an elevated city of alien elites who ruled 
the world from above.19 Why rinse our cottage cheese when life is so good? 
After losing $1.8 billion across three years in the mid-1980s, B of A even - 
tually made the necessary changes in response to deregulation (largely by 
hiring ex-Wells 
  executive^).^^ But even in the darkest days, B ofA could not 
bring itself to get rid of the perks that shielded its executives from the real 
world. At one board meeting during Bank of America's crisis period, one 
member made sensible suggestions like "Sell the corporate jet." Other 
directors listened to the recommendations, then passed them by.2' 
A CULTURE, NOT A TYRANT 
We almost didn't include this chapter in the book. On the one hand, the 
good -to-great companies became more disciplined than the direct com- 
parison companies, as with Wells Fargo in contrast to Bank of America. 
On the other hand, the unsustained comparisons showed themselves to be 
just as disciplined as the good -to-great companies, 
"Based on my analysis, I don't think we can put discipline in the book 
as a finding, " said Eric Hagen, after he completed a special analysis unit 
looking at the leadership cultures across the companies. "It is absolutely 
clear that the unsustained comparison CEOs brought tremendous disci- 
pline to their companies, and that is why they got such great initial results. 
So, discipline just doesn't pass muster as a distinguishing variable. " 
Curious, we decided to look further into the issue, and Eric undertook 
a more in-depth anal ysis. As we further examined the evidence, it became 
clear that-despite surface appearances -there was indeed a huge differ- 
ence between the two sets of companies in their approach to discipline.

Consider Ray MacDonald, who took command of Burroughs in 1964. 
A brilliant but abrasive man, MacDonald controlled the conversations, I told all the jokes, and criticized those not as smart as he (which was 
pretty much everyone around him). He got things done through sheer 
force of personality, using a form of pressure that came to be known as 
"The MacDonald 
 Vise."22 MacDonald produced remarkable results 
during his reign. Every dollar invested in 1964, the year he became pres- 
ident, and taken out at the end of 1977, when he retired, produced 
returns 6.6 times better than the general 
 market.23 However, the com- 
pany had no culture of discipline to endure beyond him. After he 
retired, his helper minions were frozen by indecision, leaving the com- 
pany, according to Business Week, "with an inability to do 
anything."24 
Burroughs then began a long slide, with cumulative returns falling 93 
percent below the market from the end of the MacDonald era to 2000. 
We found a similar story at Rubbermaid under Stanley Gault. Recall

from the Level 5 chapter that Gault quipped in response to the accusation 
of being a tyrant, "Yes, but I'm a sincere tyrant. " Gault brought strict dis- 
ciplines to Rubbermaid -rigorous planning and competitor analysis, sys- 
tematic market research, profit analysis, hard -nosed cost control, and so 
on. "This is an incredibly disciplined organization, " wrote one analyst. 
"There is an incredible thoroughness in Rubbermaid's approach to 
 life."2s 
Precise and methodical, Gault arrived at work by 6:30 and routinely 
worked eighty -hour weeks, expecting his managers to do the 
same.26 
As chief disciplinarian, Gault personally acted as the company's number 
one quality control mechanism. Walking down the street in Manhattan, he 
noticed a doorman muttering and swearing as he swept dirt into a Rubber - 
maid dustpan. "Stan whirled around and starting grilling the man on why 
he was unhappy, " said Richard Gates, who told the story to Fortune. Gault, 
convinced that the lip of the dustpan was too thick, promptly issued a dic- 
tate to his engineers to redesign the product. "On quality, I'm a sonof- 
abitch, " said Gault. His chief operating officer concurred: "He gets 
livid."27 
Rubbermaid rose dramatically under the tyranny of this singularly dis- 
ciplined leader but then just as dramaticall y declined when he departed. 
Under Gault, Rubbermaid beat the market 3.6 to 1. After Gault, Rubber - 
maid lost 59 percent of its value relative to the market, before being 
bought out by Newell. 
One particularly fascinating example of the disciplinarian syndrome 
was Chrysler under Lee Iacocca, whom Business Week described simply 
as, "The Man. The Dictator. 
 Lee."28 Iacocca became president of 
Chrysler in 1979 and imposed his towering personality to discipline the 
organization into shape. "Right away I knew the place was in a state of 
anarchy [and] needed a dose of order and discipline -and quick, " wrote 
Iacocca of his early 
 days.29 In his first year, he entirely overhauled the 
management structure, instituted strict financial controls, improved qual- 
ity control measures, rationalized the production schedule, and con- 
ducted mass layoffs to preserve 
 cash.30 "I felt like an Army Surgeon. . . . 
We had to do radical surgery, ving what we 
could."31 In dealing with the 
unions, he said, "If you do t help me out, I'm going to blow your brains 
out. I'll declare bankru cy -in the morning, and you'll all be out of 
Iacocca produ 
f ed spectacular results and Chrysler became one 
of the most celebrated turnarounds in industrial history. 
About midway through his tenure, however, Iacocca seemed to lose 
focus and the company began to decline once again. The Wall Street lour- 
nal wrote: "Mr. Iacocca headed the Statue of Liberty renovation, joined a

Worse than his moonlight career as a national hero, his lack of disci- 
pline to stay within the arenas in which Chrysler could be the best in the 
world led to a binge of highly undisciplined diversifications. In 1985, he 
was lured into the sexy aerospace business. Whereas most CEOs would be 
content with a single Gulfstream jet, Iacocca decided to buy the whole 
Gulfstream 
 company!34 Also in the mid-1980s, he embarked on a costly 
and ultimately unsuccessful joint venture with Italian sports car maker 
Maserati. "Iacocca had a soft spot for Italians, " said one retired Chrysler 
executive. "Iacocca, who owns a modest estate in Tuscany, was so intent 
on an Italian alliance that commercial realities were ignored, suggest 
industry insiders, " wrote Business Wee .35 Some estimates put the loss of 
the failed Maserati venture at $200 illion, which, according to Forbes, 
was "an enormous sum to lose on a igh -price, low -volume roadster. After 
all, no more than a few thousand

During the first half of his tendre, Iacocca produced remarkable results, 
taking the company from near bankruptcy to nearly three times the gen- 
eral market. During the second half of Iacocca's tenure, the company slid

The above cases illustrate a pattern we found in every unsustained com - 
parison: a spectacular rise under a tyrannical disciplinarian, followed by 
an equally spectacular decline when the disciplinarian stepped away, 
leaving behind no enduring culture of discipline, or when the disciplinar - 
ian himself became undisciplined and strayed wantonly outside the three 
circles. Yes, discipline is essential for great results, but disciplined action 
without disciplined understanding of the three circles cannot produce 
sustained great results. 
FANATICAL ADHERENCE TO 
THE HEDGEHOG CONCEPT 
For nearly forty years, Pitney Bowes lived inside the warm and protective 
cocoon of a monopoly. With its close relationship to the U.S. Postal Ser- 
vice and its patents on postage meter machines, Pitney attained 100 per- 
cent of the metered mail 
 market.39 By the end of the 1950s, nearly half of 
all U.S. mail passed through Pitney Bowes 
 machines.40 With gross profit 
margins in excess of 80 percent, no competition, a huge market, and a 
recession -proof business, Pitney Bowes wasn't so much a great company as 
it was a company with a great monopoly. 
Then, as almost always happens to monopolies when the protective 
cocoon is ripped away, Pitney Bowes began a long slide. First came a con- 
sent decree that required Pitney Bowes to license its patents to competitors, 
royalty free.41 Within six years, Pitney Bowes had sixteen 
 corn petit or^.^^ Pit- 
ney fell into a reactionary "Chicken Littlelthe sky is falling " diversification 
frenzy, throwing cash after ill -fated acquisitions and joint ventures, 
including a $70 mi lion bloodbath (54 percent of net stockholders' equity 
at the time) from a computer retail foray. In 1973, the company lost 
money for the firs time in its history. It was shaping up to be just another 
typical case of a monopoly -protected company gradually falling apart 
 / once confrontedjwith the harsh reality of competition. 
Fortunately, a Level 5 leader named Fred Allen stepped in and asked 
hard questions that led to deeper understanding of Pitney's role in the 
world. Instead of viewing itself as a "postage meter " company, Pitney 
======================================== [Página 134] ========================================

came to see that it could be the best in the world at servicing the back 
rooms of businesses within the broader concept of "messaging. " It also 
came to see that sophisticated back-office products, like high-end faxes 
and specialized copiers, played right into its economic engine of profit per 
customer, building off its extensive sales and service network. 
Allen and his successor, George Harvey, instituted a model of disciplined 
diversification. For example, Pitney eventuall y attained 45 percent of the 
high-end fax market for large companies, a hugely profitable cash 
 machine.43 
Harvey began a systematic process of investment in new technologies and 
products, such as the Paragon mail processor that seals and sends letters, and 
by the late 1980s, Pitney consistently derived over half its revenues from 
products introduced in the previous three 
 years.44 Later, Pitney Bowes 
became a pioneer at linking backroom machines to the Internet, yet 
another opportunity for disciplined diversification. The key point is that 
every step of diversification and innovation stayed within the three circles. 
After falling 77 percent behind the market from the consent decree to 
its darkest days in 1973, Pitney Bowes reversed course, eventually rising to 
over eleven times the market by the start of 1999. From 1973 to 2000, Pit- 
ney Bowes outperformed Coca -Cola, 3M, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, 
Motorola, Procter & Gamble, Hewlett -Packard, Walt Disney, and even 
General Electric. Can you think of any other company that emerged from 
the protective comfort of a monopoly cocoon to deliver this level of 
results? AT&T didn't. Xerox didn't. Even IBM didn't. 
Pitney Bowes illustrates what can happen when a company lacks the 
discipline to stay within the three circles and, conversely, what can hap- 
pen when it regains that discipline. 
In contrast, we found a lack of discipline to stay within the three circles 
as a key factor in the demise of nearly all the comparison companies. 
Every comparison either (1) lacked the discipline to understand its three 
circles or (2) lacked the discipline to stay within the three circles. 
======================================== [Página 135] ========================================

R. J. Reynolds is a classic case. Until the 1960s, R. J. Reynolds had a 
simple and clear concept, built around being the best tobacco company 
in the United States-a position it had held for at least twenty -five 
years.45 
Then in 1964, the Surgeon General's Office issued its report that linked 
cigarettes with cancer, and R. J. Reynolds began to diversify away from 
tobacco as a defensive measure. Of course, all tobacco companies began 
to diversify at that time for the same reason, including Philip Morris. But 
R. J. Reynolds' wanderings outside its three circles defied all logic. 
R. J. Reynolds spent nearly a third of total corporate assets in 1970 to 
buy a shipping container company and an oil company (Sea-Land and 
Aminoil), the idea being to make money by shipping its own oil.46 Okay, 
not a terrible idea on its own. But what on earth did it have to do with R. J. 
Reynolds' Hedgehog Concept? It was a wholly undisciplined acquisition 
that came about in part because Sea-Land's founder was a close friend of 
R. J. Reynolds' 
 chairman.47 
After pouring more than $2 billion into Sea-Land, the total investment 
nearl y equaled the entire amount of net stockholders' 
 equity.48 Finally, 
after years of starving the tobacco business to funnel funds into the sink- 
ing ship business, RJR acknowledged failure and sold 
 Sea-Lan~l.~~ One 
Reynolds grandson complained: "Look, these guys are the world's best at 
making and selling tobacco products, but what do they know about ships 
or oil? I'm not worried about them going broke, but they look like country 
boys with too much cash in their 
 pockets."50 
To be fair, Philip Morris did not have a perfect diversification record 
either, as evidenced by its failed purchase of 7UP. However, in stark con- 
trast to R. J. Reynolds, Philip Morris displayed greater discipline in 
response to the 1964 surgeon general's report. Instead of abandoning its 
Hedgehog Concept, Philip Morris redefined its Hedgehog Concept in 
terms of building global brands in not-so-healthy consumables (tob cco, 
beer, soft drinks, coffee, chocolate, processed cheese, etc.). Philip Mo is' 
superior discipline to stay within the three circles is one key reason wh lni the results of the two companies diverged so dramatically after the 1964 , 
report, despite the fact that they both faced the exact same industry oppor - 
tunities and threats. From 1964 to 1989 (when R. J. Reynolds disappeared 
from public trading in a leveraged buyout), $1 invested in Philip Morris 
beat $1 invested in R. J. Reynolds by over four times. 
Few companies have the discipline to discover their Hedgehog Con- 
cept, much less the discipline to build consistently within it. They fail to 
grasp a simple paradox: The more an organization has the discipline to 
======================================== [Página 136] ========================================

136 Jim Collins 
stay within its three circles, the more it will have attractive opportuni - 
ties for growth. Indeed, a great company is much more likely to die of 
indigestion from too much opportunity than starvation from too little. 
The challenge becomes not opportunity creation, but opportunity selec - 
tion. 
This notion of fanatical consistency relative to the Hedgehog Concept 
doesn't just concern the portfolio of strategic activities. It can relate to the 
entire way you manage and build an organization. Nucor built its success 
around the Hedgehog Concept of harnessing culture and technology to 
produce steel. Central to the Nucor concept was the idea of aligning 
worker interests with management and shareholder interests through an 
egalitarian meritocracy largely devoid of class distinctions. Wrote Ken 
Iverson, in his 1998 book Plain Talk: 
Inequality still runs rampant in most business corporations. I'm referring 
now to hierarchical inequality which legitimizes and institutionalizes 
the principle of "We" vs. "They. " . . . The people at the top of the corpo - 
rate hierarchy grant themselves privilege after privilege, flaunt those 
privileges before the men and women who do the real work, then won- 
der why employees are unmoved by management's invocations to cut 
costs and boost profitability. . . . When I think of the millions of dollars 
spent by people at the top of the management hierarchy on efforts to 
motivate people who are continually put down by that hierarchy, I can 
only shake my head in 
 w~nder.~' 
When we interviewed Ken Iverson, he told us that nearly 100 percent of 
the success of Nucor was due to its ability to translate its simple concept 
into disciplined action consistent with that concept. It grew into a $3.5 bil- 
lion Fortune 500 company with only four layers of management and a 
corporate headquarters staff of fewer than twenty -five people-executive, 
financial, secretarial, the whole shebang -crammed into a rented office 
the size of a small dental 
 practice.52 Cheap veneer furniture adorned the

lobby, which itself was not much larger than a closet. Instead of a corpo - 
rate dining room, executives hosted visiting dignitaries at Phil's Diner, a 
strip mall sandwich shop across the 
street.53 
Executives did not receive better benefits than frontline workers. In fact, 
executives had fewer perks. For example, all workers (but not executives) 
were eligible to receive $2,000 per year for each child for up to four years of 
post-high school 
 educati~n.~~ In one incident, a man came to Marvin 
Pohlman and said, "I have nine kids. Are you telling me that you'll pay for 
four years of school-college, trade school, whatever -for every single one 
of my kids?" Pohlman acknowledged that, yes, that's exactly what would 
happen. "The man just sat there and cried, " said Pohlman. ''I'll never forget 
it. It just captures in one moment so much of what we were trying to do."55 
When Nucor had a highly profitable year, everyone in the company 
would have a very profitable year. Nucor workers became so well paid that 
one woman told her husband, "If you get fired from Nucor, 1'11 divorce 
But when Nucor faced difficult times, everyone from top to bot- 
tom suffered. But people at the top suffered more. In the 1982 recession, 
for example, worker pay went down 25 percent, officer pay went down 60 . 
percent, and the CEO's pay went down 75 
per~ent.~' 
======================================== [Página 138] ========================================

138 Jim Collins 
Nucor took extraordinary steps to keep at bay the class distinctions that 
eventually encroach on most organizations. All 7,000 employees' names 
appeared in the annual report, not just officers' and 
 executive^'.^^ Every - 
one except safety supervisors and visitors wore the same color hard hats. 
The color of hard hats might sound trivial, but it caused quite a stir. Some 
foremen complained that special -colored hard hats identified them as 
higher in the chain, an important status symbol that they could put on the 
back shelves of their cars or trucks. Nucor responded by organizing a 
series of forums to address the point that your status and authority in 
Nucor come from your leadership capabilities, not your position. If you 
don't like it-if you really feel you need that class distinction -well, then, 
Nucor is just not the right place for 
you.59 
In contrast to Nucor's dental suite-sized headquarters, Bethlehem 
Steel built a twenty -one-story office complex to house its executive staff. At 
extra expense, it designed the building more like a cross than a rectan - 
gle-a design that accommodated the large number of vice presidents 
who needed corner offices. "The vice presidents. . . [had to have] win- 
dows in two directions, so it was out of that desire that we came up with 
the design, " explained a Bethlehem 
 executive.60 In his book Crisis in 
Bethlehem, John Strohmeyer details a culture as far to the other end of the 
continuum from Nucor as you can imagine. He describes a fleet of corpo - 
rate aircraft, used even for taking executives' children to college and flit- 
ting away to weekend hideaways. He describes a world -class eighteen -hole 
executive golf course, an executive country club renovated with Bethle - 
hem corporate funds, and even how executive rank determined shower 
priority at the 
 club.61 
We came to the conclusion that Bethlehem executives saw the very 
purpose of their activities as the perpetuation of a class system that ele- 
vated them to elite status. Bethlehem did not decline in the 1970s 
and 1980s primarily because of imp rts or technology -Bethlehem 
declined first and foremost because i was a culture wherein people 
focused their efforts on negotiating th nuances of an intricate social 
hierarchy, not on customers, competit \, rs, or changes in the external 
world. 
From 1966 (at the start of its buildup) to 1999, Nucor posted thirty -four 
consecutive years of positive profitability, while over those same thirty -four 
years, Bethlehem lost money twelve times and its cumulative profitability 
added up to less than zero. By the 1990s, Nucor's profitability beat Beth - 
lehem's every single year, and at the end of the century, Nucor -which 
======================================== [Página 139] ========================================

Good to Great 139 
had been less than a third the size of Bethlehem only a decade earlier- 
finally surpassed Bethlehem in total 
 revenues.62 Even more astounding, 
Nucor's average five-year profit per employee exceeded Bethlehem by 
almost ten 
times.63 And for the investor, $1 invested in Nucor beat $1 
invested in Bethlehem Steel by over 200 times. 
To be fair, Bethlehem had one giant problem not faced by Nucor: 
adversarial labor relations and entrenched unions. Nucor had no union 
and enjoyed remarkably good relations with its workers. In fact, when 
union organizers visited one plant, workers felt so ferociously loyal to 
Nucor that management had to protect the union organizers from workers 
who began shouting and throwing sand at 
them.64 
But the union argument begs a crucial question: Why did Nucor have 
such a better relationship with its workers in the first place? Because Ken 
Iverson and his team had a simple, crystalline Hedgehog Concept about 
aligning worker interests with management interests and-most impor - 
tantly- because they were willing to go to almost extreme lengths to build 
the entire enterprise consistent with that concept. Call them a bit fanati - 
cal if you want, but to create great results requires a nearly fanatical dedi- 
cation to the idea of consistency within the Hedgehog Concept. 
START A "STOP DOING" LIST 
Do you have a "to do7' list? 
Do you also have a "stop doing " list? 
Most of us lead busy but undisciplined lives. We have ever-expanding 
"to do" lists, trying to build momentum by doing, doing, doing-and doing 
more. And it rarely works. Those who built the good -to-great companies, 
however, made as much use of "stop doing " lists as "to do" lists. They dis- 
played a remarkable discipline to unplug all sorts of extraneous junk. 
When Darwin Smith became CEO of Kimberly -Clark, he made great 
use of "stop doing " lists. He saw that playi g the annual forecast game 
with Wall Street focused people too muc on the short term, so he just 
stopped doing it. "On balance, I see no n t advantage to our stockholders 
when we annually forecast future earni Ij/l gs," said Smith. "We will not do 
it."65 He saw "title creep " as a sign of class-consciousness and bureaucratic 
layering, so he simply unplugged titles. No one at the company would 
have a title, unless it was for a position where the outside world demanded 
a title. He saw increasing layers as the natural result of empire building. 
======================================== [Página 140] ========================================

140 [im Collins 
So he simply unplugged a huge stack of layers with a simple elegant 
mechanism: If you couldn't justify to your peers the need for at least fif- 
teen people reporting to you to fulfill your responsibilities, then you 
would have zero people reporting to 
you.66 (Keep in mind that he did this 
in the 1970s, long before it became fashionable.) To reinforce the idea 
that Kimberl y-Clark should begin thinking of itself as a consumer com - 
pany, not a paper company, he unplugged Kimberly from all paper indus - 
try trade 
  association^.^^ 
The good -to-great companies institutionalized the discipline of "stop 
doing through the use of a unique budget mechanism. Stop and think for 
a moment: What is the purpose of budgeting? Most answer that budgeting 
exists to decide how much to apportion to each activity, or to manage costs, 
or both. From a good -to-great perspective, both of these answers are wrong. 
Kimberl y-Clark didn't just reallocate resources from the paper business 
to the consumer business. It completely eliminated the paper business, 
sold the mills, and invested all the money into the emerging consumer 
business. 
I had an interesting conversation with some executives from a company 
in the paper business. It's a good company, not yet a great one, and they 
had competed directly with Kimberly -Clark before Kimberl y transformed 
itself into a consumer company. Out of curiosity, I asked them what they 
thought of Kimberly -Clark. "What Kimber did is not fair," they said. 
"Not fair?" I looked quizzical. 
"Oh, sure, they've become a muc ore successful company. But, you 
J know, if we'd sold our paper bus' ess and become a powerful consumer 
company, we could have been great, too. But we just have too much 
invested in it, and we couldn't have brought ourselves to do it." 
If you look back on the good -to-great companies, they displayed 
remarkable courage to channel their resources into only one or a few are- 
======================================== [Página 141] ========================================

Good to Great 141 
nas. Once they understood their three circles, they rarely hedged their 
bets. Recall Kroger's commitment to overturn its entire system to create 
superstores, while A&P clung to the "safety " of its older stores. Recall 
Abbott's commitment to put the bulk of its resources into becoming num - 
ber one in diagnostics and hospital nutritionals, while Upjohn clung to its 
core pharmaceutical business (where it could never be the best in the 
world). Recall how Walgreens exited the profitable food-service business 
and focused all its might into one idea: the best, most convenient drug- 
stores. Recall Gillette and Sensor, Nucor and the mini-mills, Kimberly- 
Clark and selling the mills to channel all its resources into the consumer 
business. They all had the guts to make huge investments, once they 
understood their Hedgehog Concept. 
The most effective investment strategy is a highly undiversified port - 
folio when you are right. As facetious as that sounds, that's essentially the 
approach the good -to-great companies took. "Being right" means getting 
the Hedgehog Concept; "highly undiversified7' means investing fully in 
those things that fit squarely within the three circles and getting rid of 
everything else. 
Of course, the key here is the little caveat, "When you are right." But 
how do you know when you're right? In studying the companies, we 
learned that "being right" just isn't that hard if you have all the pieces in 
place. If you have Level 5 leaders who get the right people on the bus, 
if you confront the brutal facts of reality, if you create a climate where 
the truth is heard, if you have a Council and work within the three circles, 
if you frame all decisions in the context of a crystalline Hedgehog Con- 
cept, if you act from understanding, not bravado-if you do all these 
things, then you are likely to be right on the big decisions. The real ques- 
tion is, once you know the right thing, do you have the discipline to do the 
right thing and, equally important, to stop doing the wrong things?

n July 28, 1999, drugstore.com-one of the first Internet pharma - 
cies-sold shares of its stock to the public. Within seconds of the opening 
bell, the stock multiplied nearly threefold to $65 per share. Four weeks 
later, the stock closed as high as $69, creating a market valuation of over 
$3.5 billion. Not bad for an enterprise that had sold products for less than 
nine months, had fewer than 500 emplo yees, offered no hope of investor 
dividends for years (if not decades), and deliberately planned to lose hun- 
dreds of millions of dollars before turning a single dollar of

bers? "New technology will change everything, " the logic went. "The 
Internet is going to completely revolutionize all businesses, " the gurus 
chanted. "It's the great Internet landgrab: Be there first, be there fast, 
I 
build market share -no matter how expensive -and you win, " 
yelled the 
entrepreneurs. 
We entered a remarkable moment in history when the whole idea of 
trying to build a great company seemed quaint and outdated. "Built to

Flip" became the mantra of the day. Just tell people you were doing some - 
thing, anything, connected to the Internet, and-presto!-you became 
rich by flipping shares to the public, even if you had no profits (or even a 
real company). Why take all the hard steps to go from buildup to break - 
through, creating a model that actually works, when you could yell, "New 
technology! " or "New economy!'' and convince people to give you hun- 
dreds of millions of dollars? 
Some entrepreneurs didn't even bother to suggest that they would build 
a real company at all, much less a great one. One even filed to go public 
in March of 2000 with an enterprise that consisted solely of an informa - 
tional Web site and a business plan, nothing more. The entrepreneur 
admitted to the Industry Standard that it seemed strange to go public 
before starting a business, but that didn't stop him from trying to persuade 
investors to buy 1.1 million shares at $7 to $9 per share, despite having no 
revenues, no employees, no customers, no 
company.j With the new tech- 
nolog y of the Internet, who needs all those archaic relics of the old econ- 
omy? Or so the logic went. 
At the high point of this frenzy, drugstore.com issued its challenge to 
Walgreens. At first, Walgreens' stock suffered from the invasion of the dot- 
coms, losing over 40 percent of its price in the months leading up to the 
drugstore.com public offering. Wrote Forbes in October 1999: "Investors 
seem to think that the Web race will be won by competitors who hit the 
ground running -companies like drugstore.com, which trades at 398 
times revenue, rather than Walgreen, trading at 1.4 times revenue.04 Ana- 
lysts downgraded Walgreens' stock, and the pressure on Walgreens to react 
to the Internet threat increased as nearly $1 5 billion in market value evap- 
orated5 
Walgreens' response in the midst of this frenzy? 
"We're a crawl, walk, run company, " Dan Jorndt told Forbes in describ - 
ing his deliberate, methodical approach to the Internet. Instead of reacting 
like Chicken Little, Walgreens executives did something quite unusual 
for the times. They decided to pause and reflect. They decided to use 
their brains. They decided to think! 
Slow at first (crawl), Walgreens began experimenting with a Web site 
while engaging in intense internal dialogue and debate about its implica - 
tions, within the context of its own peculiar Hedgehog Concept. "How 
will the Internet connect to our convenience concept? How can we tie it 
to our economic denominator of cash flow per customer visit? How can 
we use the Web to enhance what we do better than any other company in 
======================================== [Página 146] ========================================

the world and in a way that we're passionate about? " Throughout, Wal- 
greens executives embraced the Stockdale Paradox: "We have complete 
faith that we can prevail in an Internet world as a great company; yet, we 
must also confront the brutal facts of reality about the Internet. " One Wal- 
greens executive told us a fun little story about this remarkable moment in 
history. An Internet leader made a statement about Walgreens along the 
lines of, "Oh, Walgreens. They're too old and stodgy for the Internet 
world. They'll be left behind. " The Walgreens people, while irked by this 
arrogant comment from the Internet elite, never seriously considered a 
public response. Said one executive, "Let's quietly go about doing what 
we need to do, and it'll become clear soon enough that they just pulled 
the tail of the wrong dog." 
Then a little faster (walk), Walgreens began to find ways to tie the Inter - 
net directl y to its sophisticated inventory -and-distribution model and- 
ultimately -its convenience concept. Fill your prescription on -line, pop 
into your car and go to your local Walgreens drive -through (in whatever 
city you happen to be in at the moment), zoom past the window with 
hardly a moment's pause picking up your bottle of whatever. Or have it 
shipped to you, if that's more convenient. There was no manic lurching 
about, no hype, no bravado-just calm, deliberate pursuit of understand - 
ing, followed by calm, deliberate steps forward. 
Then, finally (run!), Walgreens bet big, launching an Internet site as 
sophisticated and well designed as most pure dot-coms. Just before writing 
this chapter, in October 2000, we went on -line to use Walgreens.com. We 
I found it as easy to use and the system of delivery as reliable and well 
thought out as Amazon.com (the reigning champion of e-commerce at 
the time). Precisely one year after the Forbes article, Walgreens had fig- 
ured out how to harness the Internet to accelerate momentum, making it 
just that much more unstoppable. It announced (on its Web site) a signif - 
icant increase in job openings, to support its sustained growth. From its 
low point in 1999 at the depths of the dot-com scare, Walgreens' stock 
price nearly doubled within a year. 
1 And what of drugstore.com? Continuing to accumulate massive losses, 
~ it announced a layoff to conserve cash. At its high point, little more than a 
~ year earlier, drugstore.com traded at a price twenty -six times higher than 
I at the time of this writing. It had lost nearly all of its initial 
 value.6 While 
Walgreens went from crawl to walk to run, drugstore.com went from run 
to walk to crawl.

Perhaps drugstore.com will figure out a sustainable model that works 
and become a great company. But it will not become great because of 
snazzy technology, hype, and an irrational stock market. It will only 
become a great company if it figures out how to apply technology to a 
coherent concept that reflects understanding of the three circles. 
TECHNOLOGY AND THE HEDGEHOG CONCEPT 
Now, you might be thinking: "But the Internet frenzy is just a speculative 
bubble that burst. So what? Everybody knew that the bubble was unsus- 
tainable, that it just couldn't last. What does that teach us about good to 
great? " 
To be clear: The point of this chapter has little to do with the specifics 
of the Internet bubble, per se. Bubbles come and bubbles go. It happened 
with the railroads. It happened with electricity. It happened with radio. It 
happened with the personal computer. It happened with the Internet. 
And it will happen again with unforeseen new technologies. 
Yet through all of this change, great companies have adapted and 
endured. Indeed, most of the truly great companies of the last hundred 
years-from Wal-Mart to Walgreens, from Procter & Gamble to Kimberl y- 
Clark, from Merck to Abbott-trace their roots back through multiple gen- 
erations of technology change, be it electricity, the television, or the 
Internet. They've adapted before and emerged great. The best ones will 
adapt again. 
We could have predicted that Walgreens would eventually figure out 
the Internet. The company had a history of making huge investments in 
technology long before other companies in its industry became tech 
say. In the early 1980s, it pioneered a massive network system called 
Intercom. The idea was simple: By linking all Walgreens stores electroni - 
cally and sending customer data to a central source, it turned every Wal- 
======================================== [Página 148] ========================================

greens outlet in the country into a customer's local pharmacy. You live in 
Florida, but you're visiting Phoenix and need a prescription refill. No 
problem, the Phoenix store is linked to the central system, and it's just like 
going down to your hometown Walgreens store. 
This might seem mundane by today's standards. But when Walgreens 
made the investment in Intercom in the late 1970s, no one else in the 
industry had anything like it. Eventually, Walgreens invested over $400 
million in Intercom, including $100 million for its own satellite 
 system.7 
Touring the Intercom headquarters -dubbed "Earth Station Wa1green"- 
"is like taking a trip through a NASA space center with its stunning array 
of sophisticated electronic gadgetry, " wrote a trade 
 jo~rnal.~ Walgreens' 
technical staff became skilled at maintaining every piece of technology, 
rather than relying on outside 
 ~~ecialists.~ It didn't stop there. Walgreens 
pioneered the application of scanners, robotics, computerized inventory 
control, and advanced warehouse tracking systems. The Internet is just 
one more step in a continuous pattern. 
Walgreens didn't adopt all of this advanced technology just for the sake 
of advanced technolog y or in fearful reaction to falling behind. No, it used 
technology as a tool to accelerate momentum after hitting breakthrough, 
and tied technology directly to its Hedgehog Concept of convenient 
drugstores increasing profit per customer visit. As an interesting aside, as 
technology became increasingly sophisticated in the late 1990s, Wal- 
greens' CIO (chief information officer) was a registered pharmacist by 
training, not a technology guru.1° Walgreens remained resolutely clear: Its 
Hedgehog Concept would drive its use of technology, not the other way 
around. 
The Walgreens case reflects a general pattern. In every good -to-great 
case, we found technological sophistication. However, it was never tech- 
nology per se, but the pioneering application of carefully selected technolo - 
gies. Every good -to-great company became a pioneer in the application of 
technology, but the technologies themselves varied greatly. (See the table 
on page 1 50.) 
Kroger, for example, was an early pioneer in the application of bar code 
scanners, which helped it accelerate past A&P by linking frontline pur - 
chases to backroom inventory management. This might not sound very 
exciting (inventory management is not something that tends to rivet read- 
ers), but think of it this way: Imagine walking back into the warehouse and 
instead of seeing boxes of cereal and crates of apples, you see stacks and 
======================================== [Página 149] ========================================

Good to Great 149 
stacks of dollar bills-hundreds of thousands and millions of freshly 
minted, crisp and crinkly dollar bills just sitting there on pallets, piled 
high to the ceiling. That's exactly how you should think of inventory. 
Every single case of canned carrots is not just a case of canned carrots, it's 
cash. And it's cash just sitting there useless, until you sell that case of 
canned carrots. 
Now recall how Kroger systematically shed its dreary old and small 
grocery stores, replacing them with nice, big, shiny superstores. To accom - 
plish this task ultimately required more than $9 billion of investment - 
cash that would somehow have to be pulled out of the low-margin grocery 
business. To put this in perspective, Kroger put more than twice its total 
annual profits into capital expenditures on average every year for thirty 
years.11 Even more impressive, despite taking on $5.5 billion of junk bond 
debt to pay a onetime $40-per-share cash dividend plus an $8 junior 
debenture to fight off corporate raiders in 1988, Kroger continued its 
cash-intensive revamping throughout the 1980s and 1990s.12 Kroger 
modernized and turned over all its stores, improved the customer's shop - 
ping experience, radically expanded the variety of products offered, and 
paid off billions of dollars of debt. Kroger's use of scanning technology to 
take hundreds of millions of crisp and crinkly dollar bills out of the ware - 
house and put them to better use became a key element in its ability to 
pull off its magic trick -pulling not one, not two, but three rabbits out of 
a hat. 
Gillette also became a pioneer in the application of technolog y. But 
Gillette's technology accelerators lay largely in manufacturing technol - 
ogy. Think about the technology required to make billions -literally bil- 
lions-of low -cost, high-tolerance razor blades. When you and I pick up a 
Gillette razor, we expect the blade to be perfect and we expect it to be 
inexpensive per shave. For example, to create the Sensor, Gillette invested 
over $200 million in design and development, most of it focused on man- 
ufacturing breakthroughs, and earned twenty -nine 
 patents.13 It pioneered 
the application of laser welding on a mass scale to shaving systems-a 
technology normally used for expensive and sophisticated products like 
heart pacemakers.14 The whole key to Gillette's shaving systems lay in 
manufacturing technology so unique and proprietary that Gillette pro- 
tected it the way Coca -Cola protects its secret formula, complete with 
armed guards and security clearances.ls

with great consistency. 
Fannie Mae Pioneered application of sophisticated algorithms and 
computer analysis to more accurately assess mortgage 
risk, thereby increasing economic denominator of profit 
per risk level. "Smarter " system of risk analysis increases 
access to home mortgages for lower-income groups,

Pitney Bowes Pioneered application of advanced technology to the 
mailroom. At first, it took the form of mechanical 
postage meters. Later, Pitney invested heavily in elec-

Technology as an Accelerator, Not a Creator, 
of Momentum 
When Jim Johnson became CEO of Fannie Mae, following David 
Maxwell, he and his leadership team hired a consulting firm to conduct a 
technology audit. The lead consultant, Bill Kelvie, used a four-level rank - 
ing, with four being cutting edge and one being Stone Age. Fannie Mae 
ranked only a two. So, following the principle of "first who," Kelvie was 
hired to move the company ahead.16 When Kelvie came to Fannie Mae in 
1990, the company lagged about ten years behind Wall Street in the use of 
technology. 
Over the next five years, Kelvie systematically took Fannie Mae from a 
2 to a 3.8 on the four-point ranking." He and his team created over 300 
computer applications, including sophisticated analytical programs to 
control the $600 billion mortgage portfolio, on-line data warehouses 
-covering 60 million properties and streamlined workflows, significantly 
reducing paper and clerical effort. "We moved technology out of the back 
office and harnessed it to transform every part of the business, " said 
Kelvie. "We created an expert system that lowers the cost of becoming a 
home owner. Lenders using our technology reduced the loan-approval 
time from thirty days to thirty minutes and lowered the associated costs by 
over $1,000 per loan." To date, the system has saved home buyers nearly 
$4 billion.18 
Notice that the Fannie Mae transition began in 1981, with the arrival of 
David Maxwell, yet the company lagged behind in the application of 
technology until the early 1990s. Yes, technology became of prime impor - 
tance to Fannie Mae, but after it discovered its Hedgehog Concept and 
after it reached breakthrough. Technology was a key part of what Fannie 
Mae leaders called "the second wind" of the transformation and acted as 
an accelerating factor.19 The same pattern holds for Kroger, Gillette, Wal- 
greens, and all the good -to-great companies -the pioneering application 
of technology usually came late in the transition and never at the start.

use of rechnology until you know which technologies are relevant. 
Ana wnich are those? Those-and only those-that link directly to the 
three intersecting circles of the Hedgenog Concept. 
To make technology productive in a transformation from good to great 
means asking the following questions. Does the technology fit directly 
with your Hedgehog Concept? If yes, then you need to become a pioneer in 
the application of that technology. If no, then ask, do you need this tech- 
nology at all? If yes, then all you need is parity. (You don't necessarily need 
the world's most advanced phone system to be a great company.) If no, 
then the technology is irrelevant, and you can ignore it. 
We came to see the pioneering application of technology as just one 
more way in which the good -to-great companies remained disciplined 
within the frame of their Hedgehog Concept. Conceptually, their relation - 
ship to technology is no different from their relationship to any other category 
of decisions: disciplined people, who engage in disciplined thought, and 
who then take disciplined action. If a technology doesn't fit squarely within 
their three circles, they ignore all the hype and fear and just go about their 
business with a remarkable degree of equanimity. However, once they 
understand which technologies are relevant, they become fanatical and 
creative in the application of those technologies. 
In the comparison companies, by contrast, we found only three cases of 
pioneering in the application of technolog y. Those three cases-Chrysler 
(computer -aided design), Harris (electronics applied to printing), and 
Rubbermaid (advanced manufacturing) -were all unsustained compar - 
isons, which demonstrates that technology alone cannot create sus- 
tained great results. Chrysler, for instance, made superb use of advanced 
computer -aided and other design technologies but failed to link those tech- 
nologies to a consistent Hedgehog Concept. As Chrysler strayed outside 
the three circles in the mid-1980s, from Gulfstream jets to Maserati sports, 
cars, no advanced technology by itself could save the company from 
another massive downturn. Technology without a clear Hedgehog Con- 
cept, and without the discipline to stay within the three circles, cannot 
make a company great.

THE TECHNOLOGY TRAP 
Two incidents stand out in my mind as I write this chapter. The first is 
Time magazine's selection in 1999 of Albert Einstein as "Person of the 
20th Century. " If you frame the person -of-the-century selection around 
the question, How different would the world be today if that person had 
not existed? the choice of Einstein is surprising, compared to leaders like 
Churchill, Hitler, Stalin, and Gandhi-people who truly changed the 
course of human history, for better or worse. Physicists point out that the 
scientific community would have reached an understanding of relativity 
with or without Einstein, perhaps five years later, certainly ten, but not 
fifty.20 The Nazis never got the bomb, and the Allies would have won the 
Second World War without it (although it would have cost more Allied 
lives). Why did Time pick Einstein? 
In explaining their selection, Time editors wrote: "It's hard to com- 
pare the influence of statesmen with that of scientists. Nevertheless, we 
can note that there are certain eras that were most defined by their pol- 
itics, others by their culture, and others by their scientific advances. . . . 
So, how will the 20th century be remembered? Yes, for democracy. 
And, yes, for civil rights. But the 20th century will be most remembered 
for its earthshaking advances in science and technology . . . [which] . . . 
advanced the cause of freedom, in some ways more than any statesman 
did. In a century that will be remembered foremost for its science and 
technology. . . one person stands out as the paramount icon of our 
age . . . Albert 
 Ein~tein."~' 
In essence, the Time editors didn't pick the person of the century so 
much as they picked the theme of the century- technology and science- 
and attached the most famous person to it. Interestingly, just a few days 
before the Einstein announcement, Time announced its person of the year 
for 1999. Who did it pick? None other than the poster child of e-commerce, 
Jeff Bezos of Amazon.com-reflecting yet again our cultural obsession 
with ,technology -driven change. Let me be clear. I neither agree nor dis- 
agree with Time's choices. I simply find them interesting and illuminat - 
ing, because they give us a window into our modern psyche. Clearly, a key 
item on our collective mind is technology, and its implications. 
Which brings me to the second incident. Taking a short break from the 
rigors of writing this book, I traveled to Minnesota to teach sessions at the 
Masters Forum. The Masters Forum has held executive seminars for 
nearly fifteen years, and I was curious to know which themes appeared 
======================================== [Página 155] ========================================

Good to Great 15s 
repeatedl y over those years. "One of the consistent themes, " said Jim Eric- 
son and Patty Griffin Jensen, program directors, "is technology, change- 
and the connection between the two." 
"Why do you suppose that is?" I asked. 
"People don't know what they don't know, " they said. "And they're 
always afraid that some new technology is going to sneak up on them from 
behind and knock them on the head. They don't understand technology, 
and many fear it. All they know for sure is that technology is an important 
force of change, and that they'd better pay attention to it." 
Given our culture's obsession with technology, and given the pioneer - 
ing application of technology in the good -to-great companies, you might 
expect that "technology " would absorb a significant portion of the discus - 
sion in our interviews with good -to-great executives. 
If technology is so vitally important, why did the good -to-great execu - 
tives talk so little about it? Certainly not because they ignored technology: 
They were technologically sophisticated and vastly superior to their com - 
parisons. Furthermore, a number of the good -to-great companies received 
extensive media coverage and awards for their pioneering use of technol - 
ogy. Yet the executives hardly talked about technolog y. It's as if the media 
articles and the executives were discussing two totally different sets of 
companies! 
I Nucor, for example, became widely known as one of the most aggres - 
sive pioneers in the application of mini-mill steel manufacturing, with 
dozens of articles and two books that celebrated its bold investments in 
I continuous thin slab casting and electric arc 
 furnaces.22 Nucor became a 
'I cornerstone case at business schools as an example of unseating the old 
order through the advanced application of new technologies. 
But when we asked Ken Iverson, CEO of Nucor during its transition, to 
name the top five factors in the shift from good to great, where on the list 
======================================== [Página 156] ========================================

156 lim Collins 
do you think he put technology? First? No. Second? No. Third? Nope. 
Fourth? Not even. Fifth? Sorry, but no. "The primary factors, " said Ken 
Iverson, "were the consistency of the company, and our ability to project 
its philosophies throughout the whole organization, enabled by our lack 
of layers and 
bureaucracy."23 
Stop and think about that for a moment. Here we have a consummate 
case study of upending the old order with new technology, and the CEO 
who made it happen doesn't even list technology in the top five factors in 
the shift from good to great. 
This same pattern continued throughout the Nucor interviews. Of the 
seven key executives and board members that we interviewed, only one 
picked technology as the number one factor in the shift, and most focused 
on other factors. A few executives did talk about Nucor's big bets on tech- 
nology somewhere in the interview, but they emphasized other factors 
even more-getting people with a farmer work ethic on the bus, getting 
the right people in key management positions, the simple structure and 
lack of bureaucracy, the relentless performance culture that increases 
profit per ton of finished steel. Technology was part of the Nucor equa - 
tion, but a secondary part. One Nucor executive summed up, "Twenty 
percent of our success is the new technology that we embrace . . . [but] 
eighty percent of our success is in the culture of our 
company."24 
Indeed, you could have given the exact same technology at the exact 
same time to any number of companies with the exact same resources as 
Nucor-and even still, they would have failed to deliver Nucor's results. 
Like the Daytona 500, the primary variable in winning is not the car, but 
the driver and his team. Not that the car is unimportant, but it is sec- 
ondary. 
Mediocrity results first and foremost from management failure, not 
technological failure. Bethlehem Steel's difficulties had less to do with the 
mini-mill technology and more to do with its history of adversarial labor 
relations, which ultimatel y had its roots in unenlightened and ineffective 
management. Bethlehem had already begun its long slide before Nucor 
and the other mini-mills had taken significant market 
 share.25 In fact, by 
the time Nucor made its technological breakthrough with continuous 
thin slab casting in 1986, Bethlehem had already lost more than 80 per- 
cent of its value relative to the market. This is not to say that technology 
played no role in Bethlehem's demise; technolog y did play a role, and 
ultimately a significant one. But technology's role was as an accelerator of 
======================================== [Página 157] ========================================

I Bethlehem's demise, not the cause of it. Again, it's the same principle at 
work-technology as an accelerator, not a cause-only in this comparison 
I case it is operating in reverse.

- Indeed, when we examined the comparison companies, we did not find 
a single example of a comparison company's demise coming primarily 
from a technology torpedo that blew it out of the water. R. J. Reynolds lost 
its position as the number one tobacco company in the world not because 
of technology, but because RJR management thrashed about with undisci - 
plined diversification and, later, went on a "let's make management rich at 
the expense of the company " buyout binge. A&P fell from the second- 
largest company in America to irrelevance not because it lagged behind 
Kroger in scanning technology, but because it lacked the discipline to con- 
front the brutal facts of reality about the changing nature of grocery stores.

Throughout business history, early technology pioneers rarely prevail in 
the end. VisiCalc, for example, was the first major personal computer 
spreadsheet.26 Where is VisiCalc today? Do you know anyone who uses it? 
And what of the company that pioneered it? Gone; it doesn't even exist. 
VisiCalc eventually lost out to Lotus 1-2-3, which itself lost out to 
Lotus then went into a tailspin, saved only by selling out to 
IBM.28 Simi- 
larly, the first portable computers came from now-dead companies, such 
as Osborne 
 computers.29 Today, we primarily use portables from compa - 
nies such as Dell and Sony. 
This pattern of the second (or third or fourth) follower prevailing over 
the early trailblazers shows up through the entire history of technological 
and economic change. IBM did not have the early lead in computers. It 
lagged so far behind Remington Rand (which had the UNIVAC, the first 
commercially successful large -scale computer) that people called its first 
computer "IBM's 
 UNIVAC."30 Boeing did not pioneer the commercial 
jet. De Havilland did with the Comet, but lost ground when one of its 
early jets exploded in midair, not exactly a brand -building moment. Boe- 
ing, slower to market, invested in making the safest, most reliable jets and 
dominated the airways for over three 
 decades.31 I could go on for pages. 
GE did not pioneer the AC electrical system; Westinghouse did.32 Palm 
Computing did not pioneer the personal digital assistant; Apple did, with 
its high-profile 
 Newton.33 AOL did not pioneer the consumer Internet 
community; CompuSewe and Prodigy did.34 
We could make a long list of companies that were technology leaders 
but that failed to prevail in the end as great companies. It would be a fas- 
cinating list in itself, but all the examples would underscore a basic truth: 
Technology cannot turn a good enterprise into a great one, nor by itself 
prevent disaster. 
History teaches this lesson repeatedly. Consider the United States deba - 
cle in Vietnam. The United States had the most technologically advanced 
fighting force the world has ever known. Super jet fighters. Helicopter 
gunships. Advanced weapons. Computers. Sophisticated communications. 
Miles of high-tech border sensors. Indeed, the reliance on technology cre- 
ated a false sense of invulnerability. The Americans lacked not technol - 
ogy, but a simple and coherent concept for the war, on which to attach 
that technology. It lurched back and forth across a variety of ineffective 
strategies, never getting the upper hand. 
Meanwhile, the technologically inferior North Vietnamese forces 
======================================== [Página 159] ========================================

Good to Great 159 
adhered to a simple, coherent concept: a guerrilla war of attrition, aimed 
at methodically wearing down public support for the war at home. What 
little technology the North Vietnamese did employ, such as the AK 47 
rifle (much more reliable and easier to maintain in the field than the 
complicated M-16), linked directly to that simple concept. And in the 
end, as you know, the United States-despite all its technological sophis - 
tication-did not succeed in Vietnam. If you ever find yourself think - 
ing that technology alone holds the key to success, then think again of 
Vietnam. 
Indeed, thoughtless reliance on technology is a liability, not an asset. 
Yes, when used right-when linked to a simple, clear, and coherent con- 
cept rooted in deep understanding -technology is an essential driver in 
accelerating forward momentum. But when used wrong -when grasped 
as an easy solution, without deep understanding of how it links to a clear 
and coherent concept-technology simply accelerates your own self- 
created demise. 
TECHNOLOGY AND THE FEAR OF 
BEING LEFT BEHIND 
The research team ferociously debated whether this topic merited its own 
chapter. 
"There must be a technolog y chapter, " said Scott Jones. "We're bom- 
barded by the importance of technology these days at the business school. 
If we don't address it, we'll leave a huge hole in the book. " 
"But it seems to me," countered Brian Larsen, "that our technology 
finding is just a special case of disciplined action, and it belongs in the 
previous chapter. Disciplined action means staying within the three cir- 
cles, and that's the essence of our technology finding. " 
"True, but it is a very special case," pointed out Scott Cederberg. "Every 
one of the companies became extreme pioneers in the application of tech- 
nology long before the rest of the world became technology obsessed. " 
"But compared to other findings like Level 5, the Hedgehog Concept, 
and 'first who,' technology feels like a much smaller issue, " retorted 
Amber Young. "I agree with Brian: Technology is important, but as a sub- 
set of discipline or perhaps the flywheel. " 
We argued throughout the summer. Then Chris Jones, in her typically 
======================================== [Página 160] ========================================

160 ]in Collins 
quiet and thoughtful way, asked a key question: "Why did the good -to- 
great companies maintain such a balanced perspective on technology, 
when most companies become reactionary, lurching and running about 
like Chicken Little, as we're seeing with the Internet? " 
Why indeed. 
Chris's question led us to an essential difference between great compa - 
nies and good companies, a difference that ultimately tipped the balance 
in favor of including this chapter. 
If you had the opportunity to sit down and read all 2,000+ pages of tran- 
scripts from the good -to-great interviews, you'd be struck by the utter 
absence of talk about "competitive strategy. " Yes, they did talk about strat- 
egy, and they did talk about performance, and they did talk about becom - 
ing the best, and they even talked about winning. But they never talked in 
reactionary terms and never defined their strategies principally in 
response to what others were doing. They talked in terms of what they 
were trying to create and how they were trying to improve relative to an 
absolute standard of excellence. 
When we asked George Harvey to describe his motivation for bringing 
change to Pitney Bowes in the 1980s, he said: "I've always wanted to see 
Pitney Bowes as a great company. Let's start with that, all right? Let's just 
start there. That's a given that needs no justification or explanation. We're 
not there today. We won't be there tomorrow. There is always so much 
more to create for greatness in an ever-changing 
 world."35 Or as Wayne 
Sanders summed up about the ethos that came to typify the inner work - 
ings of Kimberly -Clark: "We're just never satisfied. We can be delighted, 
but never 
 ~atisfied."~~ 
Those who built the good -to-great companies weren't motivated by 
fear. They weren't driven by fear of what they didn't understand. They 
weren't driven by fear of looking like a chump. They weren't driven by 
fear of watching others hit it big while they didn't. They weren't driven by 
the fear of being hammered by the competition. 
======================================== [Página 161] ========================================

Good to Great 161 
Never was there a better example of this difference than during the 
technology bubble of the late 1990s, which happened to take place right 
smack in the middle of the research on good to great. It served as an 
almost perfect stage to watch the difference between great and good play 
itself out, as the great ones responded like Walgreens -with calm equa - 
nimity and quiet deliberate steps forward -while the mediocre ones 
lurched about in fearful, frantic reaction. 
Indeed, the big point of this chapter is not about technology per se. No 
technology, no matter how amazing -not computers, not telecommuni - 
cations, not robotics, not the Internet-can by itself ignite a shift from 
good to great. No technology can make you Level 5. No technology can 
turn the wrong people into the right people. No technology can instill the 
discipline to confront brutal facts of reality, nor can it instill unwavering 
faith. No technology can supplant the need for deep understanding of the 
three circles and the translation of that understanding into a simple 
Hedgehog Concept. No technology can create a culture of discipline. No 
technology can instill the simple inner belief that leaving unrealized 
potential on the table-letting something remain good when it can 
become great-is a secular sin. 
Those that stay true to these fundamentals and maintain their balance, 
even in times of great change and disruption, will accumulate the 
momentum that creates breakthrough momentum. Those that,do not, 
those that fall into reactionary lurching about, will spiral downward or 
remain mediocre. This is the big-picture difference between great and 
good, the gestalt of the whole study captured in the metaphor of the fly- 
wheel versus the doom loop. And it is to that overarching contrast that we 
now turn.

ture a huge, heavy flywheel -a massive metal disk mounted hori- 
zontally on an axle, about 30 feet in diameter, 2 feet thick, and weighing 
about 5,000 pounds. Now imagine that your task is to get the flywheel 
rotating on the axle as fast and long as possible. 
Pushing with great effort, you get the flywheel to inch forward, moving 
almost imperceptibly at first. You keep pushing and, after two or three 
hours of persistent effort, you get the flywheel to complete one entire turn. 
You keep pushing, and the flywheel begins to move a bit faster, and with 
continued great effort, you move it around a second rotation. You keep 
pushing in a consistent direction. Three turns . . . four. . . five . . . six. . .

I harder than during the first rotation, but the flywheel goes faster and 
faster. Each turn of the flywheel builds upon work done earlier, com- 
pounding your investment of effort. A thousand times faster, then ten 
thousand, then a hundred thousand. The huge heavy disk flies forward, 
with almost unstoppable momentum. 
Now suppose someone came along and asked, "What was the one big 
push that caused this thing to go so fast? " 
You wouldn't be able to answer; it's just a nonsensical question. Was it 
the first push? The second? The fifth? The hundredth? No! It was all of 
them added together in an overall accumulation of effort applied in a con- 
sistent direction. Some pushes may have been bigger than others, but any 
single heave-no matter how large-reflects a small fraction of the entire 
cumulative effect upon the flywheel. 
BUILDUP AND BREAKTHROUGH* 
The flywheel image captures the overall feel of what it was like inside the 
companies as they went from good to great. No matter how dramatic the 
end result, the good -to-great transformations never happened in one fell 
swoop. There was no single defining action, no grand program, no one 
killer innovation, no solitary lucky break, no wrenching revolution. Good 
to great comes about by a cumulative process-step by step, action by 
action, decision by decision, turn by turn of the flywheel-that adds up to 
sustained and spectacular results. 
Yet to read media accounts of the companies, you might draw an 
entirel y different conclusion. Often, the media does not cover a company 
until the flywheel is already turning at a thousand rotations per minute. 
This entirely skews our perception of how such transformations happen, 
making it seem as if they jumped right to breakthrough as some sort of an 
overnight metamorphosis. 
"Cred~t for the terms buzldup and breakthrough should go to David S. Landes and his 
book, The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor 
(New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 1998). On page 200, Landes writes: "The 
question is really twofold. First, why and how did any country break through the crust 
of hab~t and conventional knowledge to this new mode of production? Turning to the 
first, I would stress buildup-the acculnulation of knowledge and know -how; and 
breakthrough -reaching and passing thresholds. " When we read this paragraph, we 
noted its applicability to our study and decided to adopt these terms in describing the 
good -to-great companies.

For example, on August 27, 1984, Forbes magazine published an article 
on Circuit City. It was the first national -level profile ever published on the 
company. It wasn't that big of an article, just two pages, and it questioned 
whether Circuit City's recent growth could 
 ~ontinue.~ Still, there it was, 
the first public acknowledgment that Circuit City had broken through. 
The journalist had just identified a hot new company, almost like an 
overnight success story. 
This particular overnight success story, however, had been more than a 
decade in the making. Alan Wurtzel had inherited CEO responsibility 
from his father in 1973, with the firm close to bankruptcy. First, he rebuilt 
his executive team and undertook an objective look at the brutal facts of 
reality, both internal and external. In 1974, still struggling with a crushing 
debt load, Wurtzel and his team began to experiment with a warehouse 
showroom style of retailing (large inventories of name brands, discount 
pricing, and immediate delivery) and built a prototype of this model in 
Richmond, Virginia, to sell appliances. In 1976, the company began to 
experiment with selling consumer electronics in the warehouse showroom 
format, and in 1977, it transformed the concept into the first-ever Circuit 
City store. 
The concept met with success, and the company began systematically 
converting its stereo stores into Circuit City stores. In 1982-with nine 
years of accumulated turns on the flywheel -Wurtzel and his team com- 
mitted fully to the concept of the Circuit City superstore. Over the next 
five years, as it shifted entirel y to this concept, Circuit City generated the 
highest total return to shareholders of any company on the New York 
Stock 
 E~change.~ From 1982 to 1999, Circuit City generated cumulative 
stock returns twenty -two times better than the market, handily beating 
Intel, Wal-Mart, GE, Hewlett -Packard, and Coca -Cola. 
Not surprisingly, Circuit City then found itself a prime subject for 
media attention. Whereas we found no articles of any significance in the 
decade leading up the transition, we found ninety -seven articles' worth 
examining in the decade after the transition, twenty -two of them signifi - 
cant pieces. It's as if the company hadn't even existed prior to that, despite 
having traded on a major stock exchange since 1968, and despite the 
remarkable progress made by Wurtzel and his team in the decade leading 
up to the breakthrough point. 
The Circuit City experience reflects a common pattern. In case after 
case, we found fewer articles in the decade leading up to the point of tran- 
sition than in the decade after, by an average factor of nearly three 
 times.4

For example, Ken Iverson and Sam Siege1 began turning the Nucor 
flywheel in 1965. For ten years, no one paid any attention, certainly not 
the financial press or the other steel companies. If you had asked execu - 
tives at Bethlehem Steel or U.S. Steel about "The Nucor Threat " in 
1970, they would have laughed, if they even recognized the company 
name at all (which is doubtful). By 1975, the year of its transition point 
on the stock chart, Nucor had already built its third mini -mill, long estab - 
lished its unique culture of productivity, and was well on its way to 
becoming the most profitable steel company in 
Arneri~a.~ Yet the first 
major article in Business Week did not appear until 1978, thirteen years 
after the start of the transition, and not in Fortune until sixteen years out. 
From 1965 through 1975, we found only eleven articles on Nucor, none 
of them significant. Then from 1976 through 1995, we collected ninety- 
six articles on Nucor, forty of them being major profiles or nationally 
prominent features. 
Now, you might be thinking, "But we should expect that. Of course 
these companies would get more coverage after they become wildly suc- 
cessful. What's so important about that?"

Picture an egg just sitting there. No one pays it much attention until, 
one day, the egg cracks open and out jumps a chicken! All the major mag- 
azines and newspapers jump on the event, writing feature stories-"The 
Transformation of Egg to Chicken! " "The Remarkable Revolution of the 
Egg!" "Stunning Turnaround at Egg!"-as if the egg had undergone some 
overnight metamorphosis, radically altering itself into a chicken. 
But what does it look like from the chicken's point of view? It's a com- 
pletely different story. While the world ignored this dormant -looking egg, 
the chicken was evolving, growing, developing, incubating. From the 
chicken's point of view, cracking the egg is simply one more step in a long 
chain of steps leading up to that moment -a big step, to be sure, but 
hardly the radical, single -step transformation it looks like to those watch - 
ing from outside the egg. 
It's a silly analogy, granted. But I'm using it to highlight a very impor - 
tant finding from our research. We kept thinking that we'd find "the one 
big thing, " the miracle moment that defined breakthrough. We even 
pushed for it in our interviews. But the good -to-great executives simply 
could not pinpoint a single key event or moment in time that exemplified 
the transition. Frequently, they chafed against the whole idea of allocating 
points and prioritizing factors. In every good -to-great company, at least 
one of the interviewees gave an unprompted admonishment, saying some - 
thing along the lines of, "Look, you can't dissect this thing into a series of 
nice little boxes and factors, or identify the moment of 'Aha!' or the 'one 
big thing.' It was a whole bunch of interlocking pieces that built one upon 
another. " 
Even in the most dramatic case in our study-Kimberl y-Clark selling 
the mills-the executives described an organic, cumulative process. "Dar- 
win did not change the direction of the company overnight, " said one 
Kimberly -Clark executive. "He evolved it over 
 time."6 "The transition 
wasn't like night and day," said another. "It was gradual, and I don't think 
======================================== [Página 169] ========================================

Good to Great 169 
I it was entirely clear to everybody until a few years into it."' Of course, selling 
the mills was a gigantic push on the flywheel, but it was only one push. 
After selling the mills, the full transformation into the number one paper - 
based consumer products company required thousands of additional 
pushes on the flywheel, big and small, accumulated one on top of 
another. It took years to gain enough momentum for the press to openly 
herald Kimberly -Clark's shift from good to great. Forbes wrote, "When . . . 
Kimberly -Clark decided to go head to head against P&G . . . this maga - 
zine predicted disaster. What a dumb idea. As it turns out, it wasn't a 
dumb idea. It was a smart 
 idea."8 The amount of time between the two 
Forbes articles? Twenty -one years. 
While working on the project, we made a habit of asking executives 
who visited our research laboratory what they would want to know from 
the research. One CEO asked, "What did they call what they were doing? 
Did they have a name for it? How did they talk about it at the time? " It's a 
great question, and we went back to look. The astounding answer: They 
didn't call it anything. 
Then it began to dawn on us: There was no miracle moment. (See the 
table on page 170.) Although it may have looked like a single -stroke break - 
through to those peering in from the outside, it was anything but that to 
people experiencing the transformation from within. Rather, it was a 
quiet, deliberate process of figuring out what needed to be done to create 
the best future results and then simply taking those steps, one after the 
other, turn by turn of the flywheel. After pushing on that flywheel in a 
consistent direction over an extended period of time, they'd inevitabl y hit 
a point of breakthrough.

Circuit City "The transition to focus on the superstore didn't hap-

than an abrupt shift."20 
When teaching this point, I sometimes use an example from outside 
my research that perfectly illustrates the idea: the UCLA Bruins basketball 
dynasty of the 1960s and early 1970s. Most basketball fans know that the 
Bruins won ten NCAA Championships in twelve years, at one point 
assembling a sixty-one-game winning streak, under the legendary coach 
John

But do you know how many years Wooden coached the Bruins before 
his first NCAA Championship? Fifteen. From 1948 to 1963, Wooden 
worked in relative obscurity before winning his first championship in 
1964. Year by year, Coach Wooden built the underlying foundations, de-

veloping a recruiting system, implementing a consistent philosophy, and 
refining the full-court -press style of play. No one paid too much attention 
to the quiet, soft-spoken coach and his team until-wham!-they hit 
breakthrough and systematically crushed every serious competitor for 
more than a decade. 
Like the Wooden dynasty, lasting transformations from good to great 
follow a general pattern of buildup followed by breakthrough. In some 
cases, the buildup -to-breakthrough stage takes a long time, in other cases, 
a shorter time. At Circuit City, the buildup stage lasted nine years, at 
Nucor ten years, whereas at Gillette it took only five years, at Fannie Mae 
only three years, and at Pitney Bowes about two years. But, no matter how 
short or long it took, every good -to-great transformation followed the same 
basic pattern-accumulating momentum, turn by turn of the flywheel- 
until buildup transformed into breakthrough. 
NOT JUST A LUXURY OF CIRCUMSTANCE 
It's important to understand that following the buildup -breakthrough 
flywheel model is not just a luxury of circumstance. People who say, 
"Hey, but we've got constraints that prevent us from taking this longer- 
term approach, " should keep in mind that the good -to-great companies 
followed this model no matter how dire the short -term circumstances- 
deregulation in the case of Wells Fargo, looming bankruptc y in the 
cases of Nucor and Circuit City, potential takeover threats in the cases 
of Gillette and Kroger, or million -dollar -a-day losses in the case of Fan- 
nie Mae. 
This also applies to managing the short -term pressures of Wall Street. "I 
just don't agree with those who say you can't build an enduring great com - 
pany because Wall Street won't let you," said David Maxwell of Fannie 
Mae. "We communicated with analysts, to educate them on what we were 
doing and where we were going. At first, a lot of people didn't buy into 
that-you just have to accept that. But once we got through the dark days, 
we responded by doing better every single year. After a few years, because 
of our actual results, we became a hot stock and never looked 
 back."22 And 
a hot stock it was. During Maxwell's first two years, the stock lagged 
behind the market, but then it took off. From the end of 1984 to the year 
2000, $1 invested in Fannie Mae multiplied sixty-four times, beating the 
======================================== [Página 173] ========================================

The key, we learned, is to harness the flywheel to manage these short - 
term pressures. One particularly elegant method for doing so came from 
Abbott Laboratories, using a mechanism it called the Blue Plans. Each 
year, Abbott would tell Wall Street analysts that it expected to grow earn- 
ings a specified amount-say, 15 percent. At the same time, it would set 
an internal goal of a much higher growth rate -say, 25 percent, or even 30 
percent. Meanwhile, it kept a rank -ordered list of proposed entrepreneur - 
ial projects that had not yet been funded -the Blue Plans. Toward the 
end of the year, Abbott would pick a number that exceeded analyst expec - 
tations but that fell short of its actual growth. It would then take the differ - 
ence between the "make the analysts happy " growth and the actual 
growth and channel those funds into the Blue Plans. It was a brilliant 
mechanism for managing short -term pressures while systematically invest - 
ing in the 
future.23 
We found no evidence of anything like the Blue Plans at Abbott's com- 
parison company. Instead, Upjohn executives would pump up the stock 
with a sales job ("Buy into our future7'), reverently intoning the phrase 
"investing for the long-term, " especially when the company failed to 
deliver current 
 results.24 Upjohn continuall y threw money after hare- 
brained projects like its Rogaine baldness cure, attempting to circumvent 
buildup and jump right to breakthrough with a big hit. Indeed, Upjohn 
reminded us of a gambler, putting a lot of chips on red at Las Vegas and 
1 saying, "See, we're investing for the future. " Of course, when the future 
I arrived, the promised results rarely appeared. 
Not surprisingly, Abbott became a consistent performer and a favorite 
holding on Wall Street, while Upjohn became a consistent disappoint -

ment. From 1959 to Abbott's point of breakthrough in 1974, the two 
stocks roughly tracked each other. Then they dramatically diverged, with 
Upjohn falling more than six times behind Abbott before being acquired 
in 1995.

Like Fannie Mae and Abbott, all the good -to-great companies effec - 
tively managed Wall Street during their buildup -breakthrough years, and 
they saw no contradiction between the two. They simply focused on accu - 
mulating results, often practicing the time-honored discipline of under- 
promising and overdelivering. And as the results began to accumulate -as 
the flywheel built momentum -the investing community came along 
with great enthusiasm. 
THE "FLYWHEEL EFFECT" 
The good-to-great companies understood a simple truth: Tremendous 
power exists in the fact of continued improvement and the delivery of 
results. Point to tangible accomplishments- however incremental at first- 
and show how these steps fit into the context of an overall concept that 
will work. When you do this in such a way that people see and feel the

buildup of momentum, they will line up with enthusiasm. We came to 
call this the flywheel effect, and it applies not only to outside investors but 
also to internal constituent groups. 
Let me share a story from the research. At a pivotal point in the study, 
members of the research team nearly revolted. Throwing their interview 
notes on the table, they asked, "Do we have to keep asking that stupid 
question? " 
"What stupid question? " I asked. 
"The one about commitment, alignment, and how they managed 
change. " 
"That's not a stupid question, " I replied. "It's one of the most im- 
portant. " 
"Well, " said one team member, "a lot of the executives who made the 
transition -well, they think it's a stupid question. Some don't even under - 
stand the question! " 
"Yes, we need to keep asking it, " I said. "We need to be consistent across 
the interviews. And, besides, it's even more interesting that they don't 
======================================== [Página 176] ========================================

understand the question. So, keep probing. We've got to understand how 
they overcame resistance to change and got people lined up." 
I fully expected to find that getting everyone lined up-"creating align - 
ment, " to use the jargon-would be one of the top challenges faced by 
executives working to turn good into great. After all, nearly every executive 
who'd visited the laboratory had asked this question in one form or 
another. "How do we get the boat turned? " "How do we get people com- 
mitted to the new vision? " "How do we motivate people to line up?" "How 
do we get people to embrace change? " 
To my great surprise, we did not find the question of alignment to be a 
key challenge faced by the good -to-great leaders. 
Consider Kroger. How do you get a company of over 50,000 people- 
cashiers, baggers, shelf stockers, produce washers, and so forth-to 
embrace a radical new strategy that will eventually change virtually every 
aspect of how the company builds and runs grocery stores? The answer is 
that you don't. Not in one big event or program, anyway. 
Jim Herring, the Level 5 leader who initiated the transformation of 
Kroger, told us that he avoided any attempts at hoopla and motivation. 
Instead, he and his team began turning the flywheel, creating tangible evi- 
dence that their plans made sense. "We presented what we were doing in 
such a way that people saw our accomplishments, " said Herring. "We 
tried to bring our plans to successful conclusion step by step, so that the 
mass of people would gain confidence from the successes, not just the 
words."25 Herring understood that the way to get people lined up behind a 
bold new vision is to turn the flywheel consistent with that vision-from 
two turns to four, then four to eight, then eight to sixteen-and then to 
say, "See what we're doing, and how well it is working? Extrapolate from 
that, and that's where we're going. " 
The good -to-great companies tended not to publicly proclaim big goals 
======================================== [Página 177] ========================================

Good to Great 177 
at the outset. Rather, they began to spin the flywheel -understanding to 
action, step after step, turn after turn. After the flywheel built up momen - 
tum, they'd look up and say, "Hey, if we just keep pushing on this thing, 
there's no reason we can't accomplish X." 
For example, Nucor began turning the flywheel in 1965, at first just try- 
I ing to avoid bankruptcy, then later building its first steel mills because it 
could not find a reliable supplier. Nucor people discovered that they had 
a knack for making steel better and cheaper than anyone else, so they built 
two, and then three, additional mini-mills. They gained customers, then 
more customers, then more customers- whoosh! - the flywheel built 
momentum, turn by turn, month by month, year by year. Then, around 
1975, it dawned on the Nucor people that if they just kept pushing on the 
flywheel, they could become the number one, most profitable steel com- 
pany in America. Explained Marvin Pohlman: "I remember talking with 
Ken Iverson in 1975, and he said, 'Marv, I think we can become the num - 
ber one steel company in the U.S.' 1975! And I said to him, 'Now, Ken, 
when are you going to be number one?' 'I don't know,' he said. 'But if we 
just keep doing what we're doing, there's no reason why we can't become 
number one.' 7726 It took over two decades, but Nucor kept pushing the fly- 
wheel, eventually generating greater profits than any other steel company 
1 on the Fortune 1000 list.27 
Stop and think about it for a minute. What do the right people want 
more than almost anything else? They want to be part of a winning team. 
They want to contribute to producing visible, tangible results. They want 
to feel the excitement of being involved in something that just fit-out 
works. When the right people see a simple plan born of confronting the 
brutal facts-a plan developed from understanding, not bravado-they 
are likely to say, "That711 work. Count me in." When they see the mono - 
lithic unity of the executive team behind the simple plan and the selfless,

dedicated qualities of Level 5 leadership, they'll drop their cynicism. 
When people begin to feel the magic of momentum -when they begin to 
see tangible results, when they can feel the flywheel beginning to build 
speed-that's when the bulk of people line up to throw their shoulders 
against the wheel and push. 
THE DOOM LOOP 
We found a very different pattern at the comparison companies. Instead of 
a quiet, deliberate process of figuring out what needed to be done and 
then simply doing it, the comparison companies frequently launched new 
programs -often with great fanfare and hoopla aimed at "motivating the 
troops7'-only to see the programs fail to produce sustained results. They 
sought the single defining action, the grand program, the one killer inno- 
vation, the miracle moment that would allow them to skip the arduous 
buildup stage and jump right to breakthrough. They would push the fly- 
wheel in one direction, then stop, change course, and throw it in a new 
direction -and then they would stop, change course, and throw it into yet 
another direction. After years of lurching back and forth, the comparison 
companies failed to build sustained momentum and fell instead into what 
we came to call the doom loop. 
Consider the case of Warner -Lambert, the direct comparison company 
to Gillette. 
In 1979, Warner -Lambert told Business Week that it aimed to be a lead - 
ing consumer products 
 company.28 
One year later, in 1980, it did an abrupt about -face and turned its sights 
on health care, saying, "Our flat-out aim is to go after Merck, Lilly, 
SmithKline - everybody and his 
brother."29 
In 198 1, the company reversed course yet again and returned to diversi - 
fication and consumer 
 goods.30 
Six years later, in 1987, Warner -Lambert did another U-turn, away from 
consumer goods, to try once again to be like Merck. (At the same time, the 
company spent three times as much on consumer -goods advertising as on 
R&D-a somewhat puzzling strategy, for a company trying to beat Merck.)?' 
In the early 1990s, reacting to Clinton -era health care reform, the com- 
pany threw itself into reverse yet again and reembraced diversification and 
consumer brands.j2

Each new Warner -Lambert CEO brought his own new program and 
halted the momentum of his predecessor. Ward Hagen tried to create a 
breakthrough with an expensive acquisition in the hospital supply busi- 
ness in 1982. Three years later, his successor, Joe Williams, extracted 
Warner -Lambert from the hospital supply business and took a $550 mil- 
lion 
 write-off.33 He tried to focus the company on beating Merck, but his 
successor threw the company back to diversification and consumer goods. 
And so it went, back and forth, lurch and thrash, with each CEO trying to 
make a mark with his own program. 
From 1979 through 1998, Warner -Lambert underwent three major 
restructurings - one per CEO - hacking away 20,000 people in search of 
quick breakthrough results. Time and again, the company would attain a 
burst of results, then slacken, never attaining the sustained momentum of 
a buildup -breakthrough flywheel. Stock returns flattened relative to the 
market and Warner -Lambert disappeared as an independent company, 
swallowed up by 
Pfi~er.~~ 
======================================== [Página 180] ========================================

The Warner -Lambert case is extreme, but we found some version of the 
doom loop in every comparison company. (See Appendix 8.A for a sum- 
mary.) While the specific permutations of the doom loop varied from 
company to company, there were some highly prevalent patterns, two of 
which deserve particular note: the misguided use of acquisitions and the 
selection of leaders who undid the work of previous generations. 
The Misguided Use of Acquisitions 
Peter Drucker once observed that the drive for mergers and acquisitions 
comes less from sound reasoning and more from the fact that doing deals 
is a much more exciting way to spend your day than doing actual 
 work.35 
Indeed, the comparison companies would have well understood the pop- 
ular bumper sticker from the 1980s, "When the going gets tough, we go 
shopping! " 
To understand the role of acquisitions in the process of going from good 
to great, we undertook a systematic qualitative and quantitative analysis of 
all acquisitions and divestitures in all the companies in our study, from 
ten years before the transition date through 1998. While we noticed no 
particular pattern in the amount or scale of acquisitions, we did note a sig- 
nificant difference in the success rate of the acquisitions in the good -to- 
great companies versus the comparisons. (See Appendix 8.B.) 
In contrast, the comparison companies frequentl y tried to jump right to 
breakthrough via an acquisition or merger. It never worked. Often with 
their core business under siege, the comparison companies would dive 
into a big acquisition as a way to increase growth, diversify away their trou- 
bles, or make a CEO look good. Yet they never addressed the fundamen - 
tal question: "What can we do better than any other company in the 
======================================== [Página 181] ========================================

Good to Great 181 
I world, that fits our economic denominator and that we have passion for? " 
They never learned the simple truth that, while you can buy your way to 
growth, you absolutely cannot buy your way to greatness. Two big medi - 
ocrities joined together never make one great company. 
I Leaders Who Stop the Flywheel 
The other frequently observed doom loop pattern is that of new leaders 
who stepped in, stopped an already spinning flywheel, and threw it in 
an entirely new direction. Consider Harris Corporation, which applied 
many of the good -to-great concepts in the early 1960s and began a clas - 
sic buildup process that led to breakthrough results. George Dively and 
his successor, Richard Tullis, identified a Hedgehog Concept, based on 
the understanding that Harris could be the best in the world at applying 
technology to printing and communications. Although it did not 
adhere to this concept with perfect discipline (Tullis had a penchant 
for straying a bit outside the three circles), the company did make 
enough progress to produce significant results. It looked like a promis - 
ing candidate for a good -to-great transformation, hitting breakthrough 
in 1975. 
Then the flywheel came to a grinding halt. 
In 1978, Joseph Boyd became chief executive. Boyd had previously been 
with Radiation, Inc., a corporation acquired by Harris years earlier. His first 
key decision as CEO was to move the company headquarters from Cleve - 
land to Melbourne, Florida-Radiation's hometown, and the location of 
Boyd's house and forty -seven -foot powerboat, the Lazy 
In 1983, Boyd threw a giant wrench into the flywheel by divesting the 
\ printing business. At the time, Harris was the number one producer of 
printing equipment in the world. The printing business was one of the 
most profitable parts of the company, generating nearly a third of total 
operating 
 profits.37 What did Boyd do with the proceeds from selling off 
this corporate gem? He threw the company headlong into the office 
automation business.

worth to buy Lanier Business Products, a company in the low-end word 
processing business.j9 Computenvorld magazine wrote: "Boyd targeted the 
automated office as a key. . . . Unfortunately, for Harris, the company had 
everything but an office product. The attempt to design and market a 
word processing system met with dismal failure . . . out of tune with the 
market, and had to be scrapped before 
 introdu~tion."~~ 
The flywheel, which had been spinning with great momentum after 
Dively and Tullis, came detached from the axle, wobbled into the air, and 
then crashed to a grinding halt. From the end of 1973 to the end of 1978, 
Harris beat the market by more than five times. But from the end of 1978 
to the end of 1983, Harris fell 39 percent behind the market, and by 1988 
it had fallen over 70 percent behind. The doom loop replaced the fly- 
wheel. 
THE FLYWHEEL AS A WRAPAROUND IDEA 
When I look over the good -to-great transformations, the one word that 
keeps coming to mind is consistency. Another word offered to me by 
physics professor R. J. Peterson is coherence. "What is one plus one? " he 
asked, then paused for effect. "Four! In physics, we have been talking 
about the idea of coherence, the magnifying effect of one factor upon 
another. In reading about the flywheel, I couldn't help but think of the 
principle of coherence. " However you phrase it, the basic idea is the 
same: Each piece of the system reinforces the other parts of the system to 
form an integrated whole that is much more powerful than the sum of the 
parts. It is only through consistency over time, through multiple genera - 
tions, that you get maximum results. 
In a sense, everything in this book is an exploration and description of 
the pieces of the buildup -to-breakthrough flywheel pattern. (See the table 
on page 183.) In standing back to survey the overall framework, we see 
that every factor works together to create this pattern, and each compo - 
nent produces a push on the flywheel.

like they are Leading! with a capital L. They're more interested in the 
quiet, deliberate process of pushing on the flywheel to produce Results! 
with a capital R. 
Getting the right people on the bus, the wrong people off the bus, and 
the right people in the right seats -these are all crucial steps in the early 
stages of buildup, very important pushes on the flywheel. Equally impor - 
tant is to remember the Stockdale Paradox: "We're not going to hit break - 
through by Christmas, but if we keep pushing in the right direction, we 
will eventually hit breakthrough. " This process of confronting the brutal 
facts helps you see the obvious, albeit difficult, steps that must be taken to 
turn the flywheel. Faith in the endgame helps you live through the 
months or years of buildup. 
Next, when you attain deep understanding about the three circles of 
your Hedgehog Concept and begin to push in a direction consistent with 
that understanding, you hit breakthrough momentum and accelerate with 
key accelerators, chief among them pioneering the application of tech- 
nology tied directly back to your three circles. Ultimately, to reach break - 
through means having the discipline to make a series of good decisions 
consistent with your Hedgehog Concept -disciplined action, following 
from disciplined people who exercise disciplined thought. That's it. 
That's the essence of the breakthrough process. 
In short, if you diligently and successfully apply each concept in the 
framework, and you continue to push in a consistent direction on the fly- 
wheel, accumulating momentum step by step and turn by turn, you will

eventually reach breakthrough. It might not happen today, or tomorrow, 
or next week. It might not even happen next year. But it will happen. 
And when it does, you will face an entirel y new set of challenges: how 
to accelerate momentum in response to ever-rising expectations, and how 
to ensure that the flywheel continues to turn long into the future. In short, 
your challenge will no longer be how to go from good to great, but how to 
go from great to enduring great. And that is the subject of the last chapter.

CHAPTER 9 
It is your Work in life that is the ultimate seduction. 
hen we began the Good to Great research project, we confronted 
a: How should we think about the ideas in Built to Last while 
doing the Good to Great research? 
Briefly, Built to Last, based on a six-year research project conducted at 
Stanford Business School in the early 1990s, answered the question, What 
does it take to start and build an enduring great company from the ground 
up? My research mentor and coauthor Jerry I. Porras and I studied eigh- 
teen enduring great companies -institutions that stood the test of time, 
tracing their founding in some cases back to the 1800s, while becoming 
the iconic great companies of the late twentieth century. We examined 
companies like Procter & Gamble (founded in 1837), American Express 
(founded in 1850), Johnson & Johnson (founded in 1886), and GE 
(founded in 1892). One of the companies, Citicorp (now Citigroup), was 
founded in 1812, the same year Napoleon marched into Moscow! The 
"youngest " companies in the study were Wal -Mart and Sony, which trace 
their origins back to 1945. Similar to this book, we used direct comparison 
======================================== [Página 189] ========================================

Good to Great 18s 
companies - 3M versus Norton, Walt Disney versus Columbia Pictures, 
Marriott versus Howard Johnson, and so forth-for eighteen paired com- 
parisons. In short, we sought to identify the essential distinctions between 
great companies and good companies as they endure over decades, even 
centuries. 
When I had the first summer research team assembled for the good -to- 
great project, I asked, "What should be the role of Built to Last in doing 
this study? " 
"I don't think it should play any role," said Brian Bagley. "I didn't join 
this team to do a derivative piece of work. " 
"Neither did I," added Alyson Sinclair. "I'm excited about a new pro- 
ject and a new question. It wouldn't be very fulfilling to just fill in the 
pieces of your other book. " 
"But wait a minute, " I responded. "We spent six years on the previous 
study. It might be helpful to build on our previous work. " 
"I seem to recall that you got the idea for this study when a McKinsey 
partner said that Built to Last didn't answer the question of how to change 
a good company into a great one," noted Paul Weissman. "What if the 
answers are different? " 
Back and forth, to and fro, the debate continued for a few weeks. Then 
Stefanie Judd weighed in with the argument that swayed me. "I love the 
ideas in Built to Last and that's what worries me," she said. "I'm afraid that 
if we start with BTL as the frame of reference, we'll just go around in cir - 
cles, proving our own biases. " It became clear that there would be sub - 
stantially less risk in starting from scratch, setting out to discover what we 
would, whether it matched previous work or not, 
Now, five years later, with this book complete, we can stand back to 
$ look at the two works in the context of each other. Surveying across the 
two studies, I offer the following four conclusions:

1. When I consider the enduring great companies from Built to Last, 
I now see substantial evidence that their early leaders followed the 
good -to-great framework. The only real difference is that they did so as 
entrepreneurs in small, early -stage enterprises trying to get off the 
ground, rather than as CEOs trying to transform established companies 
from good to great. 
2. In an ironic twist, I now see Good to Great not as a sequel to Built to 
Last, but as a prequel. Apply the findings in this book to create sustained 
great results, as a start -up or an established organization, and then apply 
the findings in Built to Last to go from great results to an enduring great 
company.

4. A tremendous resonance exists between the two studies; the ideas from

Built to Last: What is the difference between a "good" BHAG (Big 
Hairy Audacious Goal) and a "bad7' BHAG? 
GOOD TO GREAT IN THE EARLY STAGES 
OF BUILT TO LAST 
Looking back on the Built to Last study, it appears that the enduring great 
companies did in fact go through a process of buildup to breakthrough, 
following the good -to-great framework during their formative years. 
Consider, for example, the buildup -breakthrough flywheel pattern in 
the evolution of Wal-Mart. Most people think that Sam Walton just 
exploded onto the scene with his visionary idea for rural discount retail - 
ing, hitting breakthrough almost as a start -up company. But nothing could 
be further from the truth. 
======================================== [Página 191] ========================================

Good to Great 191 
Sam Walton began in 1945 with a single dime store. He didn't open his 
second store until seven years later. Walton built incrementally, step by 
step, turn by turn of the flywheel, until the Hedgehog Concept of large 
f discount marts popped out as a natural evolutionary step in the mid- 
1960s. It took Walton a quarter of a century to grow from that single dime 
store to a chain of 38 Wal -Marts. Then, from 1970 to 2000, Wal-Mart hit 
breakthrough momentum and exploded to over 3,000 stores with over 
$150 billion (yes, billion) in revenues2 Just like the story of the chicken 
jumping out of the egg that we discussed in the flywheel chapter, Wal- 
Mart had been incubating for decades before the egg cracked open. As 
Sam Walton himself wrote: 
Somehow over the years people have gotten the impression that Wal- 
Mart was. . . just this great idea that turned into an overnight success. 
But. . . it was an outgrowth of everything we'd been doing since 
[1945]. . . . And like most overnight successes, it was about twenty years 
in the 
making.3 
If there ever was a classic case of buildup leading to a Hedgehog Con- 
cept, followed by breakthrough momentum in the flywheel, Wal-Mart is 
it. The only difference is that Sam Walton followed the model as an 
entrepreneur building a great company from the ground up, rather than 
as a CEO transforming an established company from good to great. But 
it's the same basic idea.4 
Hewlett -Packard provides another excellent example of the good -to- 
great ideas at work in the formative stages of a Built to Last company. For 
instance, Bill Hewlett and David Packard's entire founding concept for 
HP was not what, but who-starting with each other. They'd been best 
friends in graduate school and simply wanted to build a great company 
together that would attract other people with similar values and standards. 
The founding minutes of their first meeting on August 23, 1937, begin by 
stating that they would design, manufacture, and sell products in the elec- 
trical engineering fields, very broadly defined. But then those same found - 
ing minutes go on to say, "The question of what to manufacture was 
postponed. . . ."5 
Hewlett and Packard stumbled around for months trying to come up 
with something, anything, that would get the company out of the garage. 
They considered yacht transmitters, air -conditioning control devices, med- 
ical devices, phonograph amplifiers, you name it. They built electronic

bowling alley sensors, a clock -drive for a telescope, and an electronic shock 
jiggle machine to help overweight people lose weight. It didn't really mat- 
ter what the company made in the very early days, as long as it made a 
technical contribution and would enable Hewlett and Packard to build a 
company together and with other like -minded 
 people.6 It was the ultimate 
"first who . . . then what" start-up. 
Later, as Hewlett and Packard scaled up, they stayed true to the guiding 
principle of "first who." After World War 11, even as revenues shrank with 
the end of their wartime contracts, they hired a whole batch of fabulous 
people streaming out of government labs, with nothing specific in mind for 
them to do. Recall Packard7s Law, which we cited in chapter 3: "No com - 
pany can grow revenues consistently faster than its ability to get enough of 
the right people to implement that growth and still become a great com- 
pany. " Hewlett and Packard lived and breathed this concept and obtained 
a surplus of great people whenever the opportunity presented itself. 
Hewlett and Packard were themselves consummate Level 5 leaders, 
first as entrepreneurs and later as company builders. Years after HP had 
established itself as one of the most important technology companies in 
the world, Hewlett maintained a remarkable personal humility. In 1972, 
HP vice president Barney Oliver wrote in a recommendation letter to the 
IEEE Awards Board for the Founders Award:

R While our success has been gratifying, it has not spoiled our founders. 
I Only recentl y, at an executive council meeting, Hewlett remarked: 
"Look, we've grown because the industry grew. We were lucky enough 
to be sitting on the nose when the rocket took off. We don't deserve a 
damn bit of credit. " After a moment's silence, while everyone digested 
this humbling comment, Packard said: "Well, Bill, at least we didn't 
louse it up 
 completely."7 
Shortly before his death, I had the opportunity to meet Dave Packard. 
Despite being one of Silicon Valley's first self-made billionaires, he lived 
in the same small house that he and his wife built for themselves in 1957, 
overlooking a simple orchard. The tiny kitchen, with its dated linoleum, 
and the simply furnished living room bespoke a man who needed no 
material symbols to proclaim "I'm a billionaire. I'm important. I'm suc- 
cessful. " "His idea of a good time, " said Bill Terry, who worked with 
Packard for thirty -six years, "was to get some of his friends together to 
string some barbed wire.'Is Packard bequeathed his $5.6 billion estate to a 
charitable foundation and, upon his death, his family created a eulogy 
pamphlet, with a photo of him sitting on a tractor in farming clothes. The 
caption made no reference to his stature as one of the great industrialists 
of the twentieth 
 century.9 It simply read: "David Packard, 1912 -1996, 
Rancher, etc." Level 5, indeed. 
CORE IDEOLOGY: THE EXTRA DIMENSION OF 
ENDURING GREATNESS 
During our interview with Bill Hewlett, we asked him what he was most 
proud of in his long career. "As I look back on my life's work, " he said, 
"I'm probably most proud of having helped create a company that by 
virtue of its values, practices, and success has had a tremendous impact on 
the way companies are managed around the 
w~rld."'~ The "HP Way," as 
it became known, reflected a deeply held set of core values that distin - 
guished the company more than any of its products. These values 
included technical contribution, respect for the individual, responsibility 
to the communities in which the company operates, and a deeply held 
belief that profit is not the fundamental goal of a company. These princi - 
ples, while fairly standard today, were radical and progressive in the 1950s. 
David Packard said of businessmen from those days, "While they were

reasonably polite in their disagreement, it was quite evident that they 
firmly believed that I was not one of them, and obviously not qualified to 
manage an important enterprise."" 
Hewlett and Packard exemplify a key "extra dimension7' that helped 
elevate their company to the elite status of an enduring great company, a 
vital dimension for making the transition from good to great to built to 
last. That extra dimension is a guiding philosoph y or a "core ideology, " 
which consists of core values and a core purpose (reason for being beyond 
just making money). These resemble the principles in the Declaration of 
Independence ("We hold these truths to be self-evident7')-never per- 
fectly followed, but always present as an inspiring standard and an answer 
to the question of why it is important that we exist. 
We wrote in Built to Last about Merck's decision to develop and distrib - 
ute a drug that cured river blindness. This painful disease afflicted over a 
million people with parasitic worms that swarm through the eyes to cause 
blindness. Because those who had the disease-tribal people in remote 
places like the Amazon- had no money, Merck initiated the creation of an 
independent distribution system to get the drug to remote villages and gave 
the drug away free to millions of people around the world.'* 
To be clear, Merck is not a charity organization, nor does it view itself 
as such. Indeed, it has consistently outperformed the market as a highly 
profitable company, growing to nearly $6 billion in profits and beating the 
market by over ten times from 1946 to 2000. Yet, despite its remarkable 
financial performance, Merck does not view its ultimate reason for being 
as making money. In 1950, George Merck 2d, son of the founder, set forth 
his company's philosophy: 
We try to remember that medicine is for the patient. . . . It is not for the 
profits. The profits follow, and if we have remembered that, they have 
never failed to appear. The better we have remembered it, the larger 
they have been.13

An important caveat to the concept of core values is that there are no 
specific "right7' core values for becoming an enduring great company. 
No matter what core value you propose, we found an enduring great 
company that does not have that specific core value. A company need 
not have passion for its customers (Sony didn't), or respect for the indi- 
vidual (Disney didn't), or quality (Wal -Mart didn't), or social responsi - 
bility (Ford didn't) in order to become enduring and great. This was 
one of the most paradoxical findings from Built to Last-core values are 
essential for enduring greatness, but it doesn't seem to matter what those 
core values are. The point is not what core values you have, but that you 
have core values at all, that you know what they are, that you build 
them explicitly into the organization, and that you preserve them over 
time. 
This notion of preserving your core ideology is a central feature of 
enduring great companies. The obvious question is, How do you preserve 
the core and yet adapt to a changing world? The answer: Embrace the key 
concept of preserve the core/stimulate progress. 
The storyafJNalt Disney exemplifies this duality. In 1923, an energetic 
twenty-&e-year-ohanimator moved from Kansas City to Los Angeles and 
tried to get a job in the movie business. No film company would hire him, 
so he used his meager savings to rent a camera, set up a studio in his 
uncle's garage, and begin making animated cartoons. In 1934, Mr. Disney 
took the bold step, never before taken, to create successful full -length ani - 
mated feature films, including Snow White, Pinocchio, Fantasia, and 
Bambi. In the 1950s, Disney moved into television with the Mickey 
Mouse Club. Also in the 1950s, Walt Disney paid a fateful visit to a num - 
ber of amusement parks and came away disgusted, calling them "dirty, 
phony places, run by tough -looking people."14 He decided that Disney 
could build something much better, perhaps even the best in the world, 
and the company launched a whole new business in theme parks, first 
with Disneyland and later with Walt Disney World and EPCOT Center.

Cultural and Operating Practices 
Specific Goals and Strategies 
Over time, Disney theme parks have become a cornerstone experience for 
many families from all over the world. 
Throughout all these dramatic changes -from cartoons to full-length 
feature animation, from the Mickey Mouse Club to Disney World -the 
company held firml y to a consistent set of core values that included pas- 
sionate belief in creative imagination, fanatic attention to detail, abhor - 
rence of cynicism, and preservation of the "Disney Magic. " Mr. Disney 
also instilled a remarkable constancy of purpose that permeated every new 
Disney venture-namely, to bring happiness to millions, especially chil- 
dren. This purpose cut across national borders and has endured through 
time. When my wife and I visited Israel in 1995, we met the man who 
brought Disney products to the Middle East. "The whole idea," he told us 
with pride, "is to bring a smile to a child's face. That's reall y important 
here, where there aren't enough smiles on the children. " Walt Disney pro- 
vides a classic case of preserve the core and stimulate progress, holding a 
core ideology fixed while changing strategies and practices over time, and 
its adherence to this principle is the fundamental reason why it has 
endured as a great company.

GOOD BHAGS, BAD BHAGS, AND OTHER 
CONCEPTUAL LINKS 
In the table on page 198, I've outlined a sketch of conceptual links 
between the two studies. As a general pattern, the Good -to-Great ideas 
appear to lay the groundwork for the ultimate success of the Built to Last 
ideas. I like to think of Good to Great as providing the core ideas for getting 
a flywheel turning from buildup through breakthrough, while Built to Last 
outlines the core ideas for keeping a flywheel accelerating long into the 
future and elevating a company to iconic stature. You will notice in exam - 
ining the table that each of the Good -to-Great findings enables all four of 
the key ideas from Built to Last. To briefl y review, those four key ideas are: 
1. Clock Building, Not Time Telling. Build an organization that can 
endure and adapt through multiple generations of leaders and multiple 
product life cycles; the exact opposite of being built around a single 
great leader or a single great idea.

the same time. Instead of choosing A OR B, figure out how to have A

3. Core Ideology. Instill core values (essential and enduring tenets) and 
core purpose (fundamental reason for being beyond just making 
money) as principles to guide decisions and inspire people throughout 
the organization over a long period of time. 
4. Preserve the CorelStimulate Progress. Preserve the core ideology as an 
anchor point while stimulating change, improvement, innovation, and 
renewal in everything else. Change practices and strategies while hold - 
ing core values and purpose fixed. Set and achieve BHAGs consistent 
with the core ideology.

I am not going to belabor all the links from the above table, but I 
would like to highlight one particularly powerful link: the connection 
between BHAGs and the three circles of the Hedgehog Concept. In 
Built to Last, we identified BHAGs as a key way to stimulate progress 
while preserving the core. A BHAG (pronounced bee-hag, short for "Big 
Hairy Audacious Goal") is a huge and daunting goal-like a big moun - 
tain to climb. It is clear, compelling, and people "get it" right away. A 
BHAG serves as a unifying focal point of effort, galvanizing people and 
creating team spirit as people strive toward a finish line. Like the 1960s 
NASA moon mission, a BHAG captures the imagination and grabs peo - 
ple in the gut. 
However, as exciting as BHAGs are, we left a vital question unan - 
swered. What is the diference between a bad BHAG and a good BHAG? 
Swimming from Australia to New Zealand would be a BHAG for me, but 
it would also kill me! We can now offer an answer to that question, draw - 
ing directly from the study of good -to-great companies. 
A superb example of this comes from Boeing in the 1950s. Until the early 
1950s, Boeing focused on building huge flying machines for the military- 
the B-17 Flying Fortress, the B-29 Superfortress, and the B-52 intercontinen - 
tal jet bomber Stratofortress.15 However, Boeing had virtually no presence in 
the commercial aircraft market, and the airlines showed no interest in buy- 
ing aircraft from Boeing. ("You make great bombers up there in Seattle. 
Why don't you just stick with that, " they said in response to Boeing's 
inquiries.) Today, we take for granted that most air travel takes place on Boe- 
ing jets, but in 1952, almost no one outside the military flew on Boeing.16 
Wisely, through the 1940s, Boeing had stayed away from the commer - 
cial sphere, an arena in which McDonnell Douglas had vastly superior 
abilities in the smaller, propeller -driven planes that composed the com- 
mercial fleet.17 In the early 1950s, however, Boeing saw an opportunity to 
leapfrog McDonnell Douglas by marrying its experience with large air-

, 
craft to its understanding of jet engines. Led by a Level 5 leader named 
Bill Allen, Boeing executives debated the wisdom of moving into the com- 
I mercial sphere. They came to understand that, whereas Boeing could not 
! have been the best commercial plane maker a decade earlier, the cumula - 
i tive experience in jets and big planes they had gained from military con- 
tracts now made such a dream possible. They also came to see that the 
economics of commercial aircraft would be vastly superior to the military 
I market and -of no small importance -they were just flat-out turned on 
I by the whole idea of building a commercial jet. 
So, in 1952, Bill Allen and his team made the decision to spend a quar- 
ter of the company's entire net worth to build a prototype jet that could be 
used for commercial aviation.18 They built the 707 and launched Boeing 
on a bid to become the leading commercial aviation company in the 
world. Three decades later, after producing five of the most successful 
commercial jets in history (the 707,727,737,747, and 757), Boeing stood 
as the absolute, unquestioned greatest company in the commercial air- 
plane industry, worldwide.19 Not until the late 1990s would Boeing's 
number one position be seriously challenged, and it would take a govern - 
ment consortium in the form of Airbus to do it.20

Here is the key point: Boeing's BHAG, while huge and daunting, was not 
any random goal. It was a goal that made sense within the context of the 
three circles. Boeing's executives understood with calm, equanimity that (1) 
the company could become the best in the world at commercial jet manu - 
facturing even though it had no presence in the market, (2) the shift would 
significantly improve Boeing's economics by increasing profit per aircraft 
model, and (3) the Boeing people were very passionate about the idea. Boe- 
ing acted with understanding, not bravado, at this pivotal moment in its his - 
tory, and that is one of the key reasons why it endured as a great company. 
The three circle1BHAG framework provides one powerful example of 
how the ideas from the two studies link together, and I'd like to offer it here 
as a practical tool for creating this link within your own organization. Yet it 
alone will not make your company great and lasting. To create an enduring 
great company requires all the key concepts from both studies, tied together 
and applied consistently over time. Furthermore, if you ever stop doing any 
one of the key ideas, your organization will inevitably slide backward toward 
mediocrity. Remember, it is much easier to become great than to remain 
great. Ultimately, the consistent application of both studies, one building 
upon the other, gives the best chance for creating greatness that lasts. 
WHY GREATNESS? 
During a break at a seminar that I gave to a group of my ex -students from 
Stanford, one came up to me, brow furrowed. "Maybe I'm just not ambi - 
tious enough, " he said. "But I don't really want to build a huge company. 
Is there something wrong with that?" 
"Not at all," I replied. "Greatness doesn't depend on size." I then told him

about Sina Simantob, who runs the building where I have my research lab - 
oratory. Sina has created a truly great institution. It's an old 1892 redbrick 
school building that has been renovated into the most extraordinary space, 
decorated and maintained with tremendous attention to detail, bordering 
on perfection. By one definition of results-attracting the most interesting 
people in Boulder, setting a standard that other local buildings measure 
themselves against, and generating the highest profit per foot of space-his 
small enterprise is truly a great institution in my hometown. Simantob has 
never defined greatness by size, and there is no reason for him to. 
The student paused for a moment, then said: "Okay, I accept that I don't 
need to build a big company in order to have a great company. But even so, 
why should I try to build a great company? What if I just want to be suc- 
cessful? " 
The question brought me up short. This was not a lazy person asking; 
he'd started his own business as a young man, put himself through law 
school, and after graduate school became a driven entrepreneur. He has 
remarkable energy, an intense and infectious enthusiasm. Of all the stu- 
dents I've known over the years, he is one that I have little doubt will be 
enormously successful. Yet he questions the whole idea of trying to build 
something great and lasting. 
I can offer two answers. 
First, I believe that it is no harder to build something great than to build 
something good. It might be statistically more rare to reach greatness, but 
it does not require more suffering than perpetuating mediocrity. Indeed, if 
some of the comparison companies in our study are any indication, it 
involves less suffering, and perhaps even less work. The beauty and power 
of the research findings is that they can radically simplify our lives while 
increasing our effectiveness. There is great solace in the simple fact of 
clarity-about what is vital, and what is not.

Let me illustrate this point with a nonbusiness example, the last story of 
the book. The coaching staff of a high school cross -country running team 
recently got together for dinner after winning its second state champi - 
onship in two years. The program had been transformed in the previous 
five years from good (top twenty in the state) to great (consistent con - 
tenders for the state championship, on both the boys' and girls7 teams). 
"I don't get it," said one of the coaches. "Why are we so successful? We 
don't work any harder than other teams. And what we do is just so simple. 
Why does it work? " 
He was referring to the Hedgehog Concept of the program, captured in 
the simple statement: We run best at the end. We run best at the end of 
workouts. We run best at the end of races. And we run best at the end of 
the season, when it counts the most. Everything is geared to this simple 
idea, and the coaching staff knows how to create this effect better than any 
other team in the state. For example, they place a coach at the 2-mile 
mark (of a 3.1-mile race) to collect data as the runners go past. But unlike 
most teams, which collect time splits (minutes -per-mile running pace), 
this team collects place splits (what place the runners are in as they go by). 
Then the coaches calculate not how fast the runners go, but how many , 
competitors they pass at the end of the race, from mile 2 to the finish. They 
then use this data to award "head bones " after each race. (Head bones are 
beads in the shape of shrunken skulls, which the kids make into necklaces 
and bracelets, symbolizing their vanquished competitors.) The kids learn 
how to pace themselves, and race with confidence: "We run best at the 
end," they think at the end of a hard race. "So, if I'm hurting bad, then my 
competitors must hurt a whole lot worse! " 
Of equal importance is what they don't waste energy on. For example, 
when the head coach took over the program, she found herself burdened 
with expectations to do "fun programs " and "rah-rah stuff " to motivate the 
kids and keep them interested -parties, and special trips, and shopping 
adventures to Nike outlets, and inspirational speeches. She quickly put an 
end to nearly all that distracting (and time-consuming) activity. "Look, " 
she said, "this program will be built on the idea that running is fun, racing 
is fun, improving is fun, and winning is fun. If 
you're not passionate about 
what we do here, then go find something else to do." The result: The 
number of kids in the program nearly tripled in five years, from thirty to 
eighty -two. 
Before the boys7 team won the first-ever state cross -country champi - 
onship in the school's history, she didn't explicitly set the goal or try to 
======================================== [Página 207] ========================================

Good to Great 207 
"motivate " the kids toward it. Instead, she let the kids gain momentum, 
seeing for themselves -race by race, week by week-that they could beat 
anyone in the state. Then, one day out on a training run, one boy said to 
his teammates, "Hey, I think we could win state. " "Yeah, I think so, too, " 
said another. Everyone kept running, the goal quietly understood. The 
coaching staff never once mentioned the state championship idea until 
the kids saw for themselves that they could do it. 
This created the strongest culture of discipline possible, as the seven 
varsity runners felt personally responsible for winning state-a commit - 
ment made not to the coaches, but to each other. One team member even 
called all of his teammates the night before the state race, just to make 
sure they were all getting ready for bed early. (No need for the coaches to 
be disciplinarians on this team.) Hammering through the last mile, pass- 
ing competitors ("We run best at the end!"), each kid hurt, but knew it 
would hurt a lot more if he had to look his teammates in the eyes as the 
only one who failed to come through. No one failed, and the team beat 
every other team at the state meet by a large margin. 
The head coach began rebuilding the whole program around the idea 
of "first who." One of the assistant coaches is a 300 -pound ex-shot-putter 
(hardly the image of a lean distance runner), but he is without question 
the right who: He shares the values and has the traits needed to help build 
a great team. As the program built momentum, it attracted more kids and 
more great coaches. People want to be part of this spinning flywheel; they 
want to be part of a championship team; they want to be part of a first-class 
culture. When the cross -country team posts yet another championship 
banner in the gym, more kids sign up, the gene pool deepens, the team 
gets faster, which produces more championships, which attracts more 
kids, which creates even faster teams, and so forth and so on, in the infec - 
tious flywheel effect.

any situation, they make your life and your experience better, while 
improving results. And along the way, you just might make what you're 
building great. So, I ask again: If it's no harder (given these ideas), the 
results better, and the process so much more fun -well, why wouldn't you 
go for greatness? 
To be clear, I am not suggesting that going from good to great is easy, or 
that every organization will successfully make the shift. By definition, it is 
not possible for everyone to be above average. But I am asserting that those 
who strive to turn good into great find the process no more painful or 
exhausting than those who settle for just letting things wallow along in 
mind -numbing mediocrity. Yes, turning good into great takes energy, but 
the building of momentum adds more energy back into the pool than it 
takes out. Conversely, perpetuating mediocrity is an inherently depressing 
process and drains much more energy out of the pool than it puts back in. 
But there is a second answer to the question of why greatness, one that 
is at the very heart of what motivated us to undertake this huge project in 
the first place: the search for meaning, or more precisely, the search for 
meaningful work. 
I asked the head coach of the cross -country program why she felt com- 
pelled to make it great. She paused before answering. "That's a really 
good question. " Long pause. "It's really hard to answer. " More pause. "I 
guess . . . it's because I really care about what we're doing. I believe in 
running and the impact it can make on these kids' lives. I want them to 
have a great experience, and to have the experience of being part of some - 
thing absolutely first class. " 
Now for the interesting twist: The coach has an MBA from an elite busi- 
ness school and is a Phi Beta Kappa graduate in economics, having won the 
prize for the best undergraduate honors thesis at one of the most sele.ctive 
universities in the world. She found, however, that most of what her class - 
mates went on to do-investment banking on Wall Street, starting Internet 
companies, management consulting, working for IBM, or whatever - 
held no meaning for her. She just didn't care enough about those endeav - 
ors to want to make them great. For her, those jobs held no meaningful 
purpose. And so she made the decision to search for meaningful work- 
work about which she would have such passion that the question, Why try 
for greatness? would seem almost tautological. If you're doing something 
you care that much about, and you believe in its purpose deeply enough, 
then it is impossible to imagine not trying to make it great. It's just a given. 
======================================== [Página 209] ========================================

Good to Great 209 
I've tried to imagine the Level 5 leaders of the companies we've studied 
answering the question "Why greatness? " Of course, most would say: 
"We're not great-we could be so much better. " But pushed to answer, 
"Why try for greatness? " I believe they would respond much like the cross - 
country coach. They're doing something they really care about, about 
which they have great passion. Like Bill Hewlett, they might care first and 
foremost about creating a company that by virtue of its values and success 
has a tremendous impact on the way companies are managed around the 
world. Or like Ken Iverson, they might feel a crusader's purpose to oblit- 
erate the oppressive class hierarchies that cause degradation of both labor 
and management. Or like Darwin Smith at Kimberly -Clark, they might 
derive a tremendous sense of purpose from the inner quest for excellence 
itself, being driven from within to make anything they touch the best it 
can be. Or perhaps like Lyle Everingham at Kroger or Cork Walgreen at 
Walgreens, they might have grown up in the business and just really love 
it. You don't need to have some grand existential reason for why you love 
what you're doing or to care deeply about your work (although you 
might). All that matters is that you do love it and that you do care. 
So, the question of Why greatness? is almost a nonsense question. If 
you're engaged in work that you love and care about, for whatever reason, 
then the question needs no answer. The question is not why, but how. 
Perhaps your quest to be part of building something great will not fall in 
your business life. But find it somewhere. If not in corporate life, then per- 
haps in making your church great. If not there, then perhaps a nonprofit, 
or a community organization, or a class you teach. Get involved in some - 
thing that you care so much about that you want to make it the greatest it 
can possibl y be, not because of what you will get, but just because it can 
be done. 
When you do this, you will start to grow, inevitably, toward becoming a 
Level 5 leader. Early in the book, we wondered about how to become 
======================================== [Página 210] ========================================

210 Jim Collins 
Level 5, and we suggested that you start by practicing the rest of the find- 
ings. But under what conditions will you have the drive and discipline to 
fully practice the other findings? Perhaps it is when you care deeply 
enough about the work in which you are engaged, and when your respon - 
sibilities line up with your own personal three circles. 
When all these pieces come together, not only does your work move 
toward greatness, but so does your life. For, in the end, it is impossible to 
have a great life unless it is a meaningful life. And it is very difficult to 
have a meaningful life without meaningful work. Perhaps, then, you 
might gain that rare tranquillity that comes from knowing that you've had 
a hand in creating something of intrinsic excellence that makes a contri - 
bution. Indeed, you might even gain that deepest of all satisfactions: 
knowing that your short time here on this earth has been well spent, and 
that it mattered.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 
Q: Did you originally identify more than eleven good -to-great possibilities 
and, if so, what good -to-great examples did not make it into the study? 
The eleven good -to-great companies were the only examples from our initial 
universe of Fortune 500 companies that met all the criteria for entrance into 
the study; they do not represent a sample. (See Appendix l.A for the selection 
process we used.) The fact that we studied the total set of companies that met 
our criteria should increase our confidence in the findings. We do not need to 
worry that a second set of companies in the Fortune 500 went from good to 
great-not by our criteria, anyway-by other methods. 
Q: Why did only eleven companies make the cut? 
There are three principal reasons. First, we used a very tough standard (three 
times the market over fifteen years) as our metric of great results. Second, the 
fifteen -year sustainability requirement is difficult to meet. Many companies 
show a sharp rise for five or ten years with a hit product or charismatic leader, 
but few companies manage to achieve fifteen years. Third, we were looking 
for a very specific pattern: sustained great results preceded by a sustained 
period of average results (or worse). Great companies are easy to find, but 
good -to-great companies are much more rare. When you add all these factors 
together, it is not surprising that we identified only eleven examples. 
I would like to stress, however, that the "only eleven " finding should not be 
discouraging. We had to set a cutoff and we chose a very tough one. If we had 
set a slightly lower hurdle -say, 2.5 times the market or ten years of sustain- 
ability-then many more companies would have qualified. After completing 
the research, I am convinced that many organizations can make the journey 
from good to great if they apply the lessons in this book. The problem is not 
the statistical odds; the problem is that people are squandering their time and 
resources on the wrong things. 
Q: What about statistical significance, given that only eleven companies 
made the final cut as good -to-great examples and the total study size is 
twenty -eight companies (with comparisons)? 
I We engaged two leading professors to help us resolve this question, one statis - 
tician and one applied mathematician. The statistician, Jeffrey T. Luftig at the 
======================================== [Página 212] ========================================

212 lim Collins 
University of Colorado, looked at our dilemma and concluded that we do not 
have a statistics problem, pointing out that the concept of "statistical signifi - 
cance " applies only when sampling of data is involved. "Look, you didn't sam - 
ple companies, " he said. "You did a very purposeful selection and found the 
eleven companies from the Fortune 500 that met your criteria. When you put 
these eleven against the seventeen comparison companies, the probabilities 
that the concepts in your framework appear by random chance are essentially 
zero." When we asked University of Colorado applied mathematics professor 
William P. Briggs to examine our research method, he framed the question 
thus: What is the probability of finding by chance a group of eleven compa - 
nies, all of whose members display the primary traits you discovered while the 
direct comparisons do not possess those traits? He concluded that the proba- 
bility is less than 1 in 17 million. There is virtually no chance that we simply 
found eleven random events that just happened to show the good-to -great pat- 
tern we were looking for. We can conclude with confidence that the traits we 
found are strongly associated with transformations from good to great. 
Q: Why did you limit your research to publicly traded corporations? 
Publicly traded corporations have two advantages for research: a widely 
agreed upon definition of results (so we can rigorously select a study set) and 
a plethora of easily accessible data. Privately held corporations have limited 
information available, which would be particularly problematic with compar- 
ison companies. The beauty of publicly traded companies is that we don't 
need their cooperation to obtain data. Whether they like it or not, vast 
amounts of information about them are a matter of public record. 
Q: Why did you limit your research to U.S. corporations? 
We concluded that rigor in selection outweighed the benefits of an inter- 
national study set. The absence of apples -to-apples stock return data from 
non-U.S. exchanges would undermine the consistency of our selection 
process. The comparative research process eliminates contextual "noise" 
(similar companies, industries, sizes, ages, and so forth) and gives us much 
greater confidence in the fundamental nature of our findings than having a 
geographically diverse study set. Nonetheless, I suspect that our findings will 
prove useful across geographies. A number of the companies in our study are 
global enterprises and the same concepts applied wherever they did business. 
Also, I believe that much of what we found-Level 5 leadership and the fly- 
wheel, for instance -will be harder to swallow for Americans than for 
people 
from other cultures.

Good to Great 213 
Q: Why don't any high -technology companies appear in the study set? 
Most technolog y companies were eliminated from consideration because 
they are not old enough to show the good -to-great pattern. We required at 
least thirty years of history to consider a company for the study (fifteen years of 
good results followed by fifteen years of great results). Of the technology com - 
panies that did have more than thirty years of history, none showed the spe- 
cific good -to-great pattern we were looking for. Intel, for example, never had a 
fifteen-year period of only good performance; Intel has always been great. If 
this study were to be repeated in ten or twenty years, I would fully expect that 
high-technology companies would make the list. 
Q: How does Good to Great apply to companies that are already great? 
I suggest that they use both Good to Great and Built to Last to help them bet- 
ter understand why they are great, so that they can keep doing the right things. 
As Robert Burgelman, one of my favorite professors from Stanford Business 
School, taught me years ago, "The single biggest danger in business and life, 
other than outright failure, is to be successful without being resolutely clear 
about why you are successful in the first place. " 
Q: How do you explain recent difficulties at some of the good -to-great 
companies? 
Every company -no matter how great -faces difficult times. There are no 
enduring great companies that have a perfect, unblemished record. They all 
have ups and downs. The critical factor is not the absence of difficult y but the 
ability ;o bounce back and emerge stronger. 
Furthermore, if any company ceases to practice all of the findings, it will 
eventuall y slide backward. It is not any one variable in isolation that makes a 
company great; it is the combination of all of the pieces working together in 
I an integrated package consistently and over time. Two current cases illustrate 
this point. 
One current case for concern is Gillette, which produced eighteen years of 
exceptional performance -rising to over 9 times the market from 1980 to 
1998-but stumbled in 1999. We believe the principal source of this diffi- 
culty lies in Gillette's need for greater discipline in sticking to businesses that 
fit squarely inside the three circles of its Hedgehog Concept. Of even greater 
concern is the clamoring from industry anal ysts that Gillette needs a charis - 
matic CEO from outside the company to come in and shake things up. If 
Gillette brings in a Level 4 leader, then the probability that Gillette will prove 
to be an enduring great company will diminish considerably. 
i Another troubling case is Nucor, which hit its peak in 1994 at fourteen 
I 
I times the market, then fell off considerabl y as it experienced management .

lasted only a short time in the job, before being ousted in an ugly executive - 
suite battle. One of the architects of this boardroom coup indicated in the 
Charlotte News and Observer (June 1 1, 1999, page Dl) that Iverson had fallen 
from Level 5 leadership in his old age and had begun to displa y more ego- 
centric Level 4 traits. "In his heyday, Ken was a giant of a man," he said, "but 
he wanted to take this company to the grave with him." Iverson tells a differ - -. - 
ent story, arguing that the real problem is current management's desire to 
diversify Nucor away from its Hedgehog Concept. "Iverson just shakes his 
head, " wrote the News and Observer, "saying it was to get away from diversifi - 
cation that Nucor became a narrowly focused steel products company in the 
first place. " Whatever the case-loss of Level 5 leadership or straying from the 
Hedgehog Concept, or both-the future of Nucor as a great company 
remains uncertain at the time of this writing. 
That being said, it is worth noting that most of the good -to-great compa - 
nies are still going strong at the time of this writing. Seven of the eleven 
companies have thus far generated over twenty years of extraordinary perfor - 
mance from their transition dates, with the median of the entire group 
being twenty -four years of exceptional results -a remarkable record by any 
measure.

Good to Great 215 
Q: How do you reconcile Philip Morris as a "great" company with the fact 
that it sells tobacco? 
Perhaps no company anywhere generates as much antipath y as Philip Morris. 
Even if a tobacco company can be considered truly great (and many would 
dispute that), there is doubt as to whether any tobacco company can endure, 
given the ever-growing threat of litigation and social sanction. Ironically, 
Philip Morris has the longest track record of exceptional performance from 
the date of its transition -thirty-four years -and is the only company that 
made it into both studies (Good to Great and Built to Last). This performance 
is not just a function of being in an industry with high-margin products sold to 
addicted customers. Philip Morris blew away all the other cigarette compa - 
nies, including its direct comparison, R. J. Reynolds. But for Philip Morris to 
have a viable future will require confronting square -on the brutal facts about 
society's relationship to tobacco and the social perception of the tobacco 
industry. A large percentage of the public believes that every member of the 
industry participated equally in a systematic effort to deceive. Fair or not, peo - 
ple-especially in the United States -can forgive a lot of sins, but will never 
forget or forgive feeling lied to. 
Whatever one's personal feelings about the tobacco industry (and there was 
a wide range of feelings on the research team and some very heated debates), 
having Philip Morris in both Good to Great and Built to Last has proved very 
instructive. It has taught me that it is not the content of a company's values 
that correlates with performance, but the strength of conviction with which it 
holds those values, whatever they might be. This is one of those findings that 
I find difficult to swallow, but that are completely supported by the data. (For 
further discussion of this topic, see chapter 3 of Built to Last, pages 65-71 .) 
Q: Can a company have a Hedgehog Concept and have a highly diverse 
business portfolio? 
Our study strongly suggests that highly diversified firms and conglomerates 
will rarely produce sustained great results. One obvious exception to this is 
GE, but we can explain this case by suggesting that GE has a very unusual 
and subtle Hedgehog Concept that unifies its agglomeration of enterprises. 
What can GE do better than any company in the world? Develop first-rate 
general managers. In our view, that is the essence of GE's Hedgehog Con- 
cept. And what would be GE's economic denominator? Profit per top-quartile 
management talent. Think about it this way: You have two business opportu - 
nities, both that might generate $X million in profits. But suppose one of 
those businesses would drain three times the amount of top-quartile manage - 
ment talent to achieve those profits as the other business. The one that drains 
less management talent would fit with the Hedgehog Concept and the other 
would not. Finally, what does GE pride itself on more than anything else? 
Having the best set of general managers in the world. This is their true

passion-more than lightbulbs, jet engines, or television programming. GE's 
Hedgehog Concept, properly conceived, enables the company to operate in a 
diverse set of businesses yet remain squarely focused on the intersection of the 
three circles. 
Q: What is the role of the board of directors in a transformation from good 
to great? 
First, boards play a key role in picking Level 5 leaders. The recent spate of 
boards enamored with charismatic CEOs, especially "rock star" celebrity 
types, is one of the most damaging trends for the long-term health of compa - 
nies. Boards should familiarize themselves with the characteristics of Level 5 
leadership and install such leaders into positions of responsibility. Second, 
boards at corporations should distinguish between share value and share 
price. Boards have no responsibility to a large chunk of the people who own 
company shares at any given moment, namely the shareflippers; they should 
refocus their energies on creating great companies that build value for the 
shareholders. Managing the stock for anything less than a five-t~-ten-~ear hori- 
zon confuses price and value and is irresponsible to shareholders. For a 
superb look at the board's role in taking a company from good to great, I rec- 
ommend the book Resisting Hostile Takeovers by Rita Ricardo -Campbell 
(Praeger Publishers, 1997). Ms. Ricardo -Campbell was a Gillette board 
member during the Colman Mockler era and 
provides a detailed account of 
how a responsible board wrestled with the difficult and complex question of 
price versus value. 
Q: Can hot young technology companies in a go-go world have Level 5 
leaders? 
My answer is two words: lohn Morgridge. Mr. Morgridge was the transition 
CEO who turned a small, struggling company in the Bay Area into one of the 
great technology companies of the last decade. With the flywheel turning, 
this unassuming and relatively unknown man stepped into the background 
and turned the company over to the next generation of leadership. I doubt 
you've ever heard of John Morgridge, but I suspect you've heard of the com- 
pany. It goes by the name Cisco Systems. 
Q: How can you practice the discipline of "first who7' when there is a short - 
age of outstanding people? 
First, at the top levels of your organization, you absolutel y must have the dis- 
cipline not to hire until you find the right people. The single most harmful 
step you can take in a journey from good to great is to put the wrong people in 
key positions. Second, widen your definition of "right people " to focus more 
on the character attributes of the person and less on specialized knowledge. 
======================================== [Página 217] ========================================

218 lim Collins 
Q: where and how should I begin? 
First, familiarize yourself with all the findings. Remember, no single finding 
by itself makes a great organization; you need to have them all working 
together as an integrated set. Then work sequentially through the framework, 
starting with "first who" and moving through all the major components. 
Meanwhile, work continuously on your own development toward Level 5 
leadership. I have laid out this book in a sequence consistent with what we 
observed in the companies; the very structure of the book is a road map. I 
wish you the best of luck on your journey from good to great.

SELECTION PROCESS FOR GOOD -TO-GREAT COMPANIES 
Research-team member Peter Van Genderen was instrumental in the cre- 
ation of the selection criteria and in the "death march of financial analysis " 
required to use the criteria to find the good-to-great companies. 
Criteria for Selection as a Good -to-Great 
Company 
1. The company shows a pattern of "good" performance punctuated by a 
transition point, after which it shifts to "great" performance. We define 
"great" performance as a cumulative total stock return of at least 3 times 
the general market for the period from the point of transition through fif- 
teen years (T + 15). We define "good" performance as a cumulative total 
stock return no better than 1.25 times the general stock market for the fif- 
teen years prior to the point of transition. Additionally, the ratio of the 
cumulative stock return for the fifteen years after the point of transition 
divided by the ratio of the cumulative stock return for the fifteen years 
prior to the point of transition must exceed 3. 
2. The good -to-great performance pattern must be a company shift, not an 
industry event. In other words, the company must demonstrate the pattern 
not only relative to the market, but also relative to its industry. 
3. At the transition point, the company must have been an established, ongo- 
ing company, not a start-up. This was defined as having operations for at 
least twenty -five years prior to the transition point. Additionall y, it had to 
have been publicly traded with stock return data available at least ten years 
prior to the transition point. 
4. The transition point had to occur before 1985 so that we would have 
enough data to assess the sustainability of the transition. Good-to -great 
transitions that occurred after 1985 might have been good-to-great 
shifts; however, by the time we completed our research, we would be 
unable to calculate their fifteen -year ratio of cumulative returns to the 
general market. 
5. Whatever the year of transition, the company still had to be a significant, 
ongoing, stand-alone company at the time of selection into the next stage 
of the research study. To satisfy this criterion, the company had to appear . 
in the 1995 Fortune 500 rankings, published in 1996. 
======================================== [Página 219] ========================================

220 Appendix 1.A 
6. Finally, at the time of selection, the company should still show an upward 
trend. For any company where T + 15 falls before 1996, the slope of cumu - 
lative stock returns relative to the market from the initial point of transition 
to 1996 should equal or exceed the slope of 3/15 required to satisfy crite- 
rion 1 for the T + 15 phase. 
Good -to-Great Selection Process 
We used a sifting process with increasingly tighter screens to find our compa - 
nies. The sifting process had four layers of analysis: 
;I I CRSP dat; 
'cted Into I ndustrv 
Cut 1: From the Universe of Companies to 1,435 
Companies 
We elected to begin our search with a list of companies that appeared on the 
Fortune rankings of America's largest public companies, going as far back as 
1965, when the list came into existence. Our initial list consisted of all com- 
panies that appeared on the 1965, 1975, 1985, and 1995 listings. There were 
1,435 such companies. Most people know these rankings as the "Fortune 
500," although the total number of companies listed may be as many as 1,000 
======================================== [Página 220] ========================================

1 Appendix 1.A 221 
because Fortune occasionally changes the size and format of its lists. As a base 
set to begin our analysis, the Fortune largest -companies ranking has two key 
advantages. First, it lists only companies of substantial size (companies earn 
their way onto the list by annual revenues). Therefore, nearly every company 
in the Fortune ranking met our criterion of being an established ongoing 
company at the time of transition. Second, all companies in the Fortune rank - 
ing~ are publicly traded, which allowed us to use financial stock return data as 
the basis for more rigorous screening and analysis. Privately held companies, 
which do not have to meet the same accounting and disclosure standards, 
offer no opportunity for an apples -to-apples, direct comparison analysis of 
performance. Restricting our set to the Fortune rankings has one obvious dis- 
idvantage: It limits our- analysis to U.S.-based companies. We concluded, 
however, that greater rigor in the selection process -made possible by using 
only publicly traded U.S. firms that hold to a common reporting standard 
(apples -to-apples stock return data) -outweighed the benefits of an interna - 
tional data set. 
Cut 2: From 1,435 Companies to 126 Companies 
Our next step was to use data from the University of Chicago Center for 
Research in Security Prices (CRSP) to make our final selection of good -to- 
great companies. We needed, however, a method to pare down the number of 
companies to a manageable size. We used the published Fortune rates-of- 
return data to reduce the candidate list. Fortune calculates the ten-year return 
to investors for each company in the rankings back to 1965. Using this data, 
we reduced the number of companies from 1,435 to 126. We screened for 
companies that showed substantially above -average returns in the time spans 
of 1985-1995, 1975 -1995, and 1965-1995. We also looked for companies 
that showed a pattern of above -average returns preceded by average or below - 
average returns. More specifically, the 126 companies selected passed any one 
of the following tests: 
Test 1: The compound annual total return to investors over the period 
1985-1995 exceeded the compound annual average return to investors for 
the Fortune Industrial and Service listings over the same period by 30 percent 
(i.e., total returns exceeded average returns by 1.3 times), and the company 
showed evidence of average or below -average performance in the prior two 
decades (1965-1985). 
Test 2: The compound annual total return to investors over the period 
1975-1995 exceeded the compound annual average return to investors for 
the Fortune Industrial and Service listings over the same period by 30 percent 
(i.e., total returns exceeded average returns by 1.3 times), and the company 
showed evidence of average or below -average performance in the prior 
decade (1965-1975). 
======================================== [Página 221] ========================================

222 Appendix 1.A 
Test 3: The compound annual total return to investors over the period 
1965-1995 exceeded the compound annual average return to investors for 
the Fortune Industrial and Service listings over the same period by 30 percent 
(i.e., total returns exceeded average returns by 1.3 times). The Fortune listings 
do not contain ten-year returns before 1965, so we decided to include all top 
performers over the three -decade period in the initial set. 
Test 4: Companies founded after 1970 and whose total return to investors over 
the period 1985-1995 or 1975-1995 exceeded the average return to investors 
for the Fortune Industrial and Service listings over the same period by 30 per- 
cent (i.e., total returns exceeded average returns by 1.3 times) but that did not 
meet the above criteria due to a lack of data in the Fortune list in prior 
decades. This allowed us to closely consider any companies that performed 
well in later decades but did not show up earlier on the Fortune listings. The 
1970 cutoff also allowed us to identify and eliminate from consideration any 
companies with histories too short to be a legitimate transition company. 
Cut 3: From 126 Companies to 19 Companies 
Drawing upon the research database at the University of Chicago Center for 
Research in Securities Pricing (CRSP), we analyzed the cumulative stock 
returns of each candidate company relative to the general market, looking for 
the good -to-great stock return pattern. Any company that met any one of the 
Cut 3 elimination criteria was eliminated at this stage. 
Any company that met any one of the following elimination criteria was I 
eliminated at this stage. t 
Terminology used in Cut 3 elimination criteria: 
j 
T year: Year we identified as the point at which performance began an 
upward trend-the "transition year," based on when the actual stock 
returns showed a visible upward shift. 
X period: Era of observable "good" performance relative to the market 
immediately prior to the T year. 
Y period: Era of substantially above market performance immediately 
following the T year. 
Cut 3 Elimination Criterion #1: The company displays a continual 
upward trend relative to the market over the entire time covered by 
CRSP data-there is no X period. 
Cut 3 Elimination Criterion #2: The company shows a flat to gradual 
rise relative to the market. There is no obvious shift to breakthrough per- 
formance. 
======================================== [Página 222] ========================================

Appendix l.A 223 
Cut 3 Elimination Criterion #3: The company demonstrates a transi - 
tion, but an X period of less than ten years. In other words, the pretransi- 
tion average performance data was not long enough to demonstrate a 
fundamental transition. In some cases, the company likel y had more 
years of X period performance prior to the transition year, but the stock 
became traded on the NASDAQ, NYSE, or AMEX during the X period; 
therefore, our data did not go back far enough to verib an X period. 
Cut 3 Elimination Criterion #4: The company demonstrates a transi - 
tion from terrible performance to average performance relative to the 
market. In other words, we eliminated classic turnaround situations 
where the company pulled out of a downward trend and into a trajectory 
parallel with the general market. 
Cut 3 Elimination Criterion #5: The company demonstrates a transi - 
tion, but after 1985. Good -to-great transitions that occurred after 1985 
might also have been legitimate good -to-great candidates. By the time 
we completed our research, however, we would not be able to verify that 
their fifteen -year ratio of cumulative returns to the general market met 
the three -to-one criterion. 
Cut 3 Elimination Criterion #6: The company shows a transition to 
increased performance, but the rise in performance is not sustained. 
After the initial rise, it goes flat or declines relative to the market until 
the time of consideration for selection into the study. 
Cut 3 Elimination Criterion #7: The company demonstrates a volatile 
pattern of returns-large upward and downward swings -with no clear 
X period, Y period, or T year. 
Cut 3 Elimination Criterion #8: A complete set of CRSP data is not 
available before 1975, making it impossible to identify a verifiable X 
period of ten years. 
Cut 3 Elimination Criterion #9: There is a transition pattern, but the 
company demonstrated a period of such spectacular performance prior 
to the X period that there is substantial evidence that the company is a 
great company that had fallen temporarily on difficult times, rather than 
a good or mediocre company that became great. The classic example is 
Walt Disney. 
Cut 3 Elimination Criterion #lo: The company is acquired, has 
merged, or is otherwise eliminated from consideration as a stand -alone 
company by the time of the final Cut 3 analysis. 
Cut 3 Elimination Criterion #11: The company shows a mild transition 
but falls short of three times the market.

Appendix 1.A 227 
Cut 4: From Nineteen Companies to Eleven Good- 
to-Great Companies 
We wanted to find companies that made a transition, not industries that made 
a transition; merely being in the right industry at the right time would not 
qualify a company for the study. To separate industry transitions from com- 
pany transitions, we decided to repeat the CRSP analysis for the remaining 
nineteen companies, only this time against a composite industry index rather 
than the general stock market. Companies that showed a transition relative to 
their industry would be selected for the final study set. 
For each of the remaining nineteen companies, we looked back in time via 
the S&P industry composites and created an industry set of companies at the 
time of transition (within five years). We then acquired CRSP stock return 
data on all of the companies in the industry composite. If the company had 
multiple industry lines of business, we used two separate industry tests. We 
then created an industry cumulative returns index against which we plotted 
the cumulative returns for the transition company. This allowed us to identify 
and eliminate from the stud y any companies that did not show the transition 
pattern relative to their industry. 
Through industry analysis, we eliminated eight companies. Sara Lee, 
Heinz, Hershey, Kellogg, CPC, and General Mills demonstrated a dramatic 
upward shift relative to the general stock market in about 1980, but none of 
these companies demonstrated a shift relative to the food industr y. Coca -Cola 
and Pepsico demonstrated a dramatic upward shift relative to the general 
stock market in about 1960 and again in 1980, but neither demonstrated a 
shift relative to the beverage industry. We therefore ended up with eleven 
companies that made it through Cuts 1 through 4 and into the research study. 
(Note: At the time of initial selection into the study, three of the companies 
did not yet have a full fifteen years of cumulative stock data-Circuit City, 
Fannie Mae, and Wells Fargo. We continued to monitor the data until they 
hit T + 15 years, to ensure that they would meet the "three times the market 
over fifteen years " standard of performance. All three did, and remained in 
the study.) 
======================================== [Página 227] ========================================

DIRECT COMPARISON SELECTIONS 
Direct Comparison Selection Process 
The purpose of the direct comparison analysis is to create as close to a "his- 
torical controlled experiment " as possible. The idea is simple: By finding 
companies that were approximately the same ages and had similar opportuni - 
ties, lines of business, and success profiles as each of the good -to-great compa - 
nies at the time of transition, we were able to conduct direct comparative 
analysis in our research, looking for the distinguishing variables that account 
for the transition from good to great. Our objective was to find companies that 
could have done what the good -to-great companies did, but failed to do so, 
and then ask: "What was different? " We performed a systematic and method - 
ical collection and scoring of all obvious comparison candidates for each 
good -to-great company, using the following six criteria. 
Business Fit: At the time of transition, the comparison candidate had similar 
products and services as the good -to-great company. 
Size Fit: At the time of transition, the comparison candidate was the same 
basic size as the good -to-great company. We applied a consistent scoring 
matrix based upon the ratio of the comparison candidate revenues divided by 
the good -to-great company revenues at the time of transition. 
Age Fit: The comparison candidate was founded in the same era as the 
good -to-great company. We applied a consistent scoring matrix based upon 
a calculated age ratio of the comparison candidate to the good -to-great 
company. 
Stock Chart Fit: The cumulative stock returns to market chart of the compar - 
ison candidate roughly tracks the pattern of the good -to-great company until 
the point of transition, at which point the trajectories of the two companies 
separate, with the good -to-great company outperforming the comparison can - 
didate from that point on. 
Conservative Test: At the time of transition, the comparison candidate was 
more successful than the good -to-great company -larger and more profitable, 
with a stronger market position and better reputation. This is a critical test, 
stacking the deck against our good -to-great companies. 
======================================== [Página 228] ========================================

Appendix l.B 229 
Face Validity: This takes into account two factors: (1) The comparison candi - 
date is in a similar line of business at the time of selection into the study, and 
(2) the comparison candidate is less successful than the good-to-great com- 
pany at the time of serettion into the study. 
Thus, face validity and conservative test work together: Conservative test 
ensures that the comparison company was stronger than the good -to-great 
company at the year of the good -to-great company's transition, and weaker than 
the good -to-great company at the time of selection into the study. 
We scored each comparison candidate on each of the above six criteria on 
a scale of 1 to 4: 
4 = The comparison candidate fits the criteria extremely well-there 
are no issues or qualifiers. 
3 = The comparison candidate fits the criteria reasonably well-there 
are minor issues or qualifiers that keep it from getting a 4. 
2 = The comparison candidate fits the criteria poorly -there are major 
issues and concerns. 
1 = The comparison candidate fails the criteria. 
The following table shows the comparison candidates for each good -to- 
great company with their average score across the six criteria. The comparison 
candidate selected as the direct comparison appears at the top of each list.

OVERVIEW OF RESEARCH STEPS 
Once the twenty -eight companies had been selected (eleven good -to-great, 
eleven direct comparison, six unsustained comparison), the following steps 
and analyses were taken by the research team. 
COMPANY CODING DOCUMENTS 
For each company, a member of the team would identify and collect articles 
and published materials on the company, including: 
1. All major articles published on the company over its entire histor y, from 
broadburces such as Forbes, Fortune, Business Week, the Wall Street four- 
nal, Nation's Business, the New York Times, U.S. News, the New Republic, 
Harvard Business Review, and the Economist and from selected articles 
from industry - or topic -specific sources. 
2. Materials obtained directly from the companies, especially books, articles, 
speeches by executives, internally produced publications, annual reports, 
and other company documents. 
3. Books written about the industry, the company, and/or its leaders pub - 
lished either by the company or by outside observers. 
4. Business school case studies and industry analyses. 
5. Business and industry reference materials, such as the Biographical Dictio - 
nary of American Business Leaders, the International Directory of Company 
Histories, Hoover's Handbook of Companies, Development of American 
Industries, and similar sources. 
6. Annual reports, proxy statements, analyst reports, and any other materials 
available on the company, especially during the transition era. 
Then for each company, the researcher would systematically code all of 
the information into a "coding document, " organized according to the fol- 
lowing categories, proceeding chronologicall y from the founding of the com- 
pany to the present day:

2 Interview Questions 
Could you briefly give an overview of your relationship to the company -years 
involved and primary responsibilities held? 
What do you see as the top five factors that contributed to or caused the upward 
shift in peformance during the years [ten years before transition] to [ten years 
after transition]? 
Now let's return to each of those five factors, and I'd like you to allocate a total 
of 100 points to those factors, according to their overall importance to the tran- 
sition (total across all five factors equals 100 points). 
Could you please elaborate on the [top two or three] factors? Can you give me 
specific examples that illustrate the factor? 
======================================== [Página 239] ========================================

240 Appendix l.D 
Did the company make a conscious decision to initiate a major change or tran- 
sition during this time fiame? 
[If a conscious decision:] To the best of your recollection, when did the company 
begin to make the key decisions that led to the transition (what year, approxi - 
mately)? 
[If a conscious decision:] What sparked the decision to undertake a major tran - 
sition? 
What was the process by which the company made key decisions and developed 
key strategies during the transition era-not what decisions the company made, 
but how did it go about making them? 
What was the role, if any, of outside consultants and advisors in making the key 
decisions? 
On a scale of 1 to 10, what confidence did you have in the decisions at the time 
they were made, before you knew their outcome? (Ten means you had great con- 
fidence that they were very good decisions with high probability of success. One 
means you had little confidence in the decisions; they seemed risky-a roll of 
the dice.) 
[If had confidence of 6 or greater:] What gave you such confidence in the deci- 
sions? 
How did the company get commitment and alignment with its decisions? 
Can you cite a specific example of how this took place? 
What did you try during the transition that didn't work? 
How did the company manage the short -term pressures of Wall Street while 
,making long -term changes and investments for the future? 
Many companies undertake change programs and initiatives, yet their efforts do 
not produce lasting results. One of the remarkable aspects of [good -to-great 
company's] transition is that it has endured -it was not just a short -term 
upswing. We find this extraordinary. What makes [good -to-great company] dif - 
ferent? What were the primary factors in the endurance of the transition far 
beyond the first few years? 
We will be comparing [good -to-great company] to [comparison company], which 
was in your industry at the time of your transition but-unlike [good -to-great 
company] -did not show a significant and lasting shift in performance. What 
======================================== [Página 240] ========================================

Appendix l.D 241 
was different about [good -to-great company] that enabled it to make this transi - 
tion? Other companies could have done what you did, but didn't; what did you 
have that they didn't? 
Can you think of one particularly powerful example or vignette from your expe - 
rience or observation that, to you, exemplifies the essence of the shift fiom good 
to great at [good -to-great company]? 
Who else would you strongly recommend that we interview? 
1 Inside management during and after the transition. 
External board members or other key outside people. 
Are there any questions we didn't ask, but should have? 
SPECIAL ANALYSIS UNITS 
We undertook a series of special analysis units. These units were designed to 
shed light on the question of good to great by systematic comparison and 
(where possible) quantification of key variables between the good -to-great 
companies and the comparison companies. 
Acquisitions and Divestitures 
This analysis unit sought to understand the role of acquisitions and divest - 
ments in the transition from good to great. 
Obiectives: 
1. What is the quantitative difference in acquisitions and divestments, if any, 
between the pretransition and posttransition eras for the good -to-great 
companies? 
2. How do the good -to-great companies differ in acquisitions and divestments 
from the dire$ comparisons? 
3. How do the good -to-great companies differ in acquisitions and divestments 
from the unsustained comparisons? 
To do this analysis, we created a database for each company, year by year: 
1. List of acquisitions made during the year and their financial attributes. 
2. Total number of acquisitions made during the year. 
======================================== [Página 241] ========================================

242 Appendix 1.D 
3. Total combined size of all acquisitions made during the year. 
4. List of divestments made during the year and their financial attributes. 
5. Total number of divestments made during the year. 
6. Total combined size of all divestments made during the year. 
Using this data, we did eight major analyses: 
1. Good -to-great companies: pre- and posttransition. 
2. Good -to-great companies versus comparison companies: pre- and posttran- 
sition. 
3. Unsustained transition companies: pre- and posttransition decades. 
4. Summary pre- and postdecade anal ysis: good -to-great companies versus 
direct comparisons versus unsustained comparisons. 
5. Good -to-great companies: transition date to present. 
6. Good -to-great companies versus comparison companies: transition date to 
1998. 
7. Unsustained comparisons: transition date to 1998. Do the same analysis as 
for the good -to-great companies from transition date to 1998. 
8. Summary, transition date to 1998: good -to-great companies versus direct 
comparisons versus unsustained comparisons. 
In addition, this analysis looked at the qualitative aspects of acquisitions 
and divestitures, examining questions such as: 
1. Overall strategy of acquisitions. 
2. Overall strategy of integrating acquisitions. 
3. The ultimate success of each major acquisition. 
4. Ultimate success of the overall acquisition strategy. 
Industry Performance Analysis - In this analysis, we looked at the performance of the companies versus the 
performance of the industries. The purpose of the analysis was to determine 
whether the companies were in highly attractive industries at the time of the 
transition. We created spreadsheets that quantified each industry versus the 
company, to determine the relationship between the two. 
We compared each good -to-great company's industr y relative to all other 
industries that appeared in the Standard 6 Poor's Analyst's Handbook for a 
period from the transition year to 1995. We used the following procedure: 
======================================== [Página 242] ========================================

Appendix 1.D 243 
1. For each good-to-great company, determine all industries that are listed in 
the S6PAnalyst's Handbook from the year of transition to 1995. 
2. For each of these industries, use the total returns from the transition year of 
the corresponding company to 1995 to determine the percentage change 
in total returns for a period from the transition year to 1995. 
3. Rank the industries according to their percentage returns over this 
period. 
'Executive Churn Analysis 
This analysis unit looked at the extent to which the executive teams changed 
in the companies during crucial points in their history. 
Using Moody's Company Information Reports, we calculated churn in the 
good-to-great companies versus comparison companies: 
Average percent of departures over pretransition decade. 
Average percent of departures over posttransition decade. 
Average percent of additions over pretransition decade. 
Average percent of additions over posttransition decade. 
Average total churn percentage over pretransition decade. 
Average total churn percentage over posttransition decade. 
Same analyses repeated out to 1998. 
Objectives: 
1. What is the quantitative difference in executive churn and/or continuity, if 
any, between the pretransition and posttransition eras for the good-to-great 
companies? 
2. How do the good -to-great companies differ in executive churn and/or con- 
tinuity from the direct comparisons? 
3. How do the good-to -great companies differ in executive churn and/or con- 
tinuity from the unsustained comparisons? 
CEO Analysis: 
We examined a total of fifty-six CEOs. For each set of CEOs during the tran- 
sition era in all three sets of companies (good-to-great, direct comparison, and 
unsustained comparison), we did a qualitative examination of: 
======================================== [Página 243] ========================================

244 Appendix 1.D 
1. Management style. 
2. Executive persona. 
3. Personal life. 
4. What they saw as their top five priorities as CEO. 
Also, for each good -to-great company, direct comparison, and unsustained 
comparison, we examined the CEO background and tenure. Beginning with 
CEOs in place ten years prior to the transition year through 1997, we deter - 
mined: 
1. Whether the CEO was brought in from the outside directly into the role of 
CEO (i.e., hired as CEO). 
2. Number of years of emplo yment with the company prior to becoming 
CEO. 
3. Age at the time of becoming CEO. 
4. Start year and end year of tenure in CEO role. 
5. Number of years CEO position was held. 
6. Responsibility held immediately prior to becoming CEO. 
7. Factors in selection of that person as CEO (why picked as CEO). 
8. Education (especially study areas-e.g., law, business -and degrees held). 
9. Work experience and other experiences (e.g., military) prior to joining the 
company. 
Executive Compensation 
This unit examined executive compensation across the companies in our 
study. For the twenty -eight companies in the study, from ten years before the 
transition point to 1998, we collected data and performed a wide variety of 
analyses. 
1. Total of all officers' and directors' salary + bonus as a percent of net worth 
at transition year. 
2. CEO's total cash compensation as a percent of net worth at transition year. 
3. CEO's salary + bonus as a percent of net worth at transition year. 
4. Difference between CEO's salary + bonus and average of top four execu - 
tives' salary + bonus as a percent of net worth at transition year and at 
transition year + 10 years.

Objectives: 
1. What is the quantitative difference in executive compensation, if any, 
between the pretransition and posttransition eras for the good -to-great 
companies? 
2. How do the good -to-great companies differ in executive compensation 
from the direct comparisons? 
3. How do the good -to-great companies differ in executive compensation 
from the unsustained comparisons? 
In this unit, we sought to examine the good -to-great companies, the direct 
comparisons, and the unsustained comparisons for evidence of layoffs as a sig- 
nificant conscious tactic in an attempt to improve company performance. We 
examined: 
1. Total emplo yment head count year by year, from ten years prior to transi - 
tion through 1998. 
2. Evidence of layoffs as a significant tactic in an attempt to improve com- 
pany performance during the ten years prior and ten years after the date of 
transition. 
3. If layoffs did occur, then calculate the number of people laid off, nomi - 
nally and as a percent of the total workforce. 
Corporate Ownership Analysis 
The point of this analysis was to determine if there were any significant differ - 
ences in the corporate ownership of the good -to-great and direct comparisons. 
We looked at: 
1. The presence of large -block shareholders and groups. 
2. The extent of board ownership. 
3. The extent of executive ownership. 
======================================== [Página 246] ========================================

Appendix 1.D 247 
Media Hype Analysis 
This unit looked at the degree of "media hype7' surrounding the good -to-great 
companies, direct comparisons, and unsustained comparisons. For the period 
ten years before to ten years after the transition date for each of the compa - 
nies, we looked at: 
1. Total number of articles in the pre- and posttransition decades and for the 
two decades combined. 
2. Total number of "feature " articles on the company in the pre- and post- 
transition decades and for the two decades combined. 
3. Total number of the above articles that explicitly talk about a "transition, " 
"rebound, " "turnaround, " "transformation, " under way at the company in 
the pre- and posttransition decades and for the two decades combined. 
4. Total number of "highly positive " articles, total number of "neutral " arti- 
cles (from slightl y negative to slightl y positive), and total number of 
"highly negative " articles in the pre- and posttransition decades and for the 
two decades combined. 
Technology Analysis 
This unit examined the role of technolog y, drawing largel y upon executive 
interviews and written source materials: 
1. Pioneering applications of technology. 
2. Timing of technology. 
3. Criteria for selection and use of specific technologies. 
4. Role of technology in decline of comparison companies. 
COMPARATIVE ANALYSES FRAMEWORKS 
Finally, in addition to the above, we performed a number of comparative 
analyses frameworks as we moved through the project. These were less 
detailed analyses than those above, although they all did derive directly from 
the research evidence. They included: 
The use of bold corporate moves 
Evolutionary versus revolutionary corporate process 
Executive class versus egalitarianism

INSIDE VERSUS OUTSIDE CEO ANALYSIS 
The following tables show the total number of inside versus outside CEOs 
within each company. For each good -to-great company, we examined all the 
CEOs from ten years prior to the transition date to 1998. For the direct 
comparison company, we did the same analysis, using the corresponding 
good -to-great company's transition date. For each unsustained comparison 
company, we examined the period from ten years prior to its attempted transi - 
tion date to 1998. We counted any CEO who had been with the company for 
one year or less as an outsider.

INDUSTRY ANALYSIS RANKINGS 
We compared each good-to -great company's industry relative to all other 
industries that appeared in the Standard 6 Poor's Analyst's Handbook for a 
period from the transition year to 1995. We used the following procedure: 
1. For each good-to-great company, determine all industries that are listed in 
the S6PAnalyst's Handbook from the year of transition to 1995. 
2. For each of these industries, use the total returns from the transition year of 
the corresponding company to 1995, to determine the percentage change 
in total returns for a period from the transition year to 1995. 
3. Rank the industries according to their percentage returns over this period. 
The following table shows that a company does not need to be in a great- 
performing industr y to produce a transition to great results.

DOOM LOOP BEHAVIOR IN THE COMPARISON COMPANIES 
DIRECT COMPARISONS 
A&P vacillated, shifting from one strategy to another, always looking for a sin- 
gle stroke to quickly solve its problems. Held pep rallies, launched programs, 
grabbed fads, fired CEOs, hired CEOs, and ficd them yet again. Article 
headlines for A&P during the years of decline read, "Heralding the Trumpet 
of Change, " "Awakening the Giant, " "Renewing A&P," and "Great Expecta - 
tions. " The expectations were never realized.' 
Addressograph 
Went into a Chicken Little "The Sky Is Falling " panic about the decline of its 
core business. Tried a quixotic "total corporate rejuvenation, " throwing itself 
into the office automation field against IBM, Xerox, and Kodak. When this 
failed, the next CEO engineered a "strategic flip-flop" away from office 
automation. Then, "like a brain surgeon vanishing from the operating room 
in the middle of an operation, " that CEO resigned after less than a year. The 
next CEO does another "180-degree turn" and buys his way into offset print - 
ing. It fails; the company takes a write -off. Four CEOs in six years, leading up 
to 1984. Later, not one, but two bankru ptcies2 
Bank of America 
Went into a reactionary revolution mode in response to deregulation. Fell 
behind in ATMs and technolog y, then threw itself into an expensive catch- 
wup program. Fell behind in ~Hlifornia, then launched a crash program to 
catch -up. Tried to "pull off its own version of Mao's Cultural Revolution " by 
hiring corporate change consultants who led "corporate encounter groups " 
and tried to institute a "rah-rah approach to management. " Lurched after 
Charles Schwab; culture clash erupted, and later sold it back. Lurched after 
Security Pacific, trying to emulate Wells Fargo's Crocker merger; acquisition 
failed, creating a multibillion -dollar write -off.? 
======================================== [Página 254] ========================================

Appendix 8.A 255 
Bethlehem Steel 
Vacillated back and forth: diversification, then focus on steel, then back to 
diversification, then back to steel. Fell behind in technology and moderniza - 
tion, then launched a crash program to catch up. Management reacted to the 
unions, then unions reacted to management, then management reacted to 
unions, then unions reacted to management, and so on. Meanwhile, foreign 
competitors and Nucor snuck in from below to devour market share.4 
Eckerd 
Fell into doom loop by making unrelated acquisitions, in search of growth, 
but without any guiding Hedgehog Concept. Bought a candy company, a 
chain of department stores, a security service, and a food-service supplier. In 
the biggest disaster, it bought American Home Video; lost $31 million, then 
sold it off to Tandy at $72 million below book value. Eckerd never fully recov - 
ered, got bought in a leveraged buyout, and later sold out to J. C. 
Penney.5 
Great Western Financial 
Inconsistency of program. Would zig one way (trying to look more like a 
bank), then zag another way (trying to become a diversified firm). Into insur - 
ance, then later out of insurance. Into leasing and manufactured housing, 
then back to focus on finance and banking. "Don't worry about what you call 
us-a bank, an S&L or a Zebra. " Held together by the personal vision of the 
CEO, but when he retired, Great Western stumbled under its unwieldy, inco - 
herent model, fell into reactionary restructuring, and sold out to Washington 
MutuaL6 
R. J. Reynolds 
As RJR began to slip and found itself under siege from antitobacco forces, it 
reacted by throwing itself into ill-considered acquisitions, such as Sea-Land. It 
bought Ska- and and poured over $2 billion into trying to make it work (all 
the while, its tobacco factories were falling apart from underinvestment), then 
sold it at a loss five years later. With each new CEO, it got a new strategy. 
Later, after losing its number one spot to Philip Morris, RJR threw itself into a 
leveraged buyout, designed primarily to enrich management rather than 
build the 
company.7 
Scott Paper 
Fell into reactionary diversification as its core business came under attack 
from Procter & Gamble and Kimberly -Clark. With each new CEO, Scott got 
a new road, a new direction, a new vision. With fanfare, Scott undertook rad- 
ical change efforts in the late 1980s, but never answered the question, What 
======================================== [Página 255] ========================================

256 Appendix 8.A 
can we be the best in the world at? Fell into restructuring mode. Hired A1 
Dunlap, known as Chainsaw Al, who cut 41 percent of the workforce in one 
fell swoop and then sold the 
company.8 
Silo 
Vacuum left after death of Sidney Cooper. Next generation pursued growth 
for growth's sake. Whereas Circuit City would go into a region, build a dis- 
tribution center, and fill every surrounding town with a store, Silo irra- 
tionall y jumped from city to city, one store here, another store there, creating 
a totall y unsystematic hodgepodge agglomeration of stores, with no regional 
economies of scale. Did not stick with a consistent concept or la yout. Silo 
acquired by Cyclops, then Cyclops acquired by Dixons. Management fired 
by new 
  owner^.^ 
Upjohn 
Fell into a pattern of selling the future ("The future never looked brighter7') 
and hyping the potential of new products. But results failed to match the 
hype. Upjohn stock became volatile and speculative -up and down, up and 
down again -as it sold the sizzle, but never delivered the steak. Later, like a 
gambler at Las Vegas, it threw its chips on "savior products, " such as Rogaine 
baldness cure. Persistent product problems, with Halcion and others, exacer- 
bated the swings. Eventually succumbed to restructuring disease and merged 
with Pharmacia.l0 
Warner -Lambert 
Lurched back and forth, from consumer products to pharmaceuticals and 
health care, then back again, then both at the same time, then back to one, 
then back to the other. Each new CEO had a new vision, and new restructur- 
ing, stopping the momentum of his predecessor and starting the flywheel 
back in another direction. Tried to ignite breakthrough with bold acquisi- 
tions, but failed and took hundreds of millions in write-offs. In the end, after 
years of inconsistent programs, it lurched into the arms of Pfizer, ending its 
turbulent existence as an independent company.ll 
UNSUSTAINED COMPARISONS 
Burroughs 
During its rise, Burroughs' CEO, "a brilliant but abusive man, " led a sweep- 
ing total reengineering. Cost cutting led to morale problems, which led to los- 
ing good people. Picked a weak successor. He failed and was replaced by a 
======================================== [Página 256] ========================================

Appendix 8.A 257 
"brilliant, brash, overly aggressive " CEO who set a new direction, blaming 
the prior generation. Another massive reorganization, 400 executives leave in 
one purge. Posters adorned the walls, touting new programs. The company 
restructured again. Got yet another CEO who tried yet another restructuring, 
another new direction. More decline, and then another CEO.'* 
Chrysler 
Five years of stellar performance, then decline back into crisis. "Like so many 
patients with a heart condition, we'd survived emergency surgery several years 
before only to revert to our old unhealth y lifestyle, " wrote an insider. Diverted 
attention into Italian sports cars, corporate jet business, and defense. Revived 
in second turnaround in 1990s, but eventually sold out to Daimler.I3 
Harris 
Rose with a CEO who had a Hedgehog Concept in his head, and who pro- 
duced an initial flywheel effect. But he did not instill this concept into his 
executive team. Later, when he retired, executives replaced the Hedgehog 
Concept with a growth mantra. Harris lurched off into office automation, 
which proved to be a disaster, and then into a series of unrelated acquisi - 
tions. Fell into the "sell the sizzle, but never deliver the steak syndrome. The 
flywheel came to a 
grinding halt.14 
Hasbro 
Hasbro is the one comparison company that nearly got it all right. It built 
spectacular results by consistently pursuing the Hedgehog Concept of revital - 
izing classic toy brands, like G.I. Joe. Unfortunatel y, the architect of the ini- 
tial transformation died unexpectedly at a young age.His successor appeared 
to be more a Level 3 (competent manager) than a Level 5 leader. The fly- 
wheel slowed. The CEO reacted with restructuring and eventually hired an 
outsider to rebuild momentum.I5 
Rubbermaid 
If there ever was a company that skipped the buildup stage, it's Rubbermaid. 
Its transition CEO launched "a complete restructuring of the company, a very 
dramatic and traumatic undertaking. " Growth became the mantra, growth 
even at the expense of long-term momentum in the flywheel. When the CEO 
retired, it became clear that he was the primary force in the flywheel, not a 
strong team guided by a systematic Hedgehog Concept. The flywheel slowed; 
the company succumbed to restructuring disease and selling the future with- 
out delivering results. Rubbermaid fell from Fortune's number one most 
admired to being acquired by Newell, in just five 
 years.16 
======================================== [Página 257] ========================================

258 Appendix 8.A 
Teledyne 
Teledyne rose and fell with the genius of one man, Henry Singleton, known 
as the Sphinx. The company's Hedgehog Concept was, in essence: Follow 
Henry's brain. Singleton engineered over a hundred acquisitions, in fields 
from electronics to exotic metals. The problems arose when Henry retired 
and took his brain with him. Teledyne fell into a downward spiral, eventually 
merging with Allegheny."

(1 + Monthly Total Return @ t2); where ml = end of the first month fol- 
lowing tl, m2 = end of the second month following tl, and so forth. 
General Stock Market (also called the General Market or just the Mar - 
ket): NYSE/AMEX/NASDAQ value -weighted return, which consists of 
the combined market value of all companies traded on these exchanges 
(including dividends reinvested) weighted by the capitalization of the 
company divided by the capitalization of the market. 
Cumulative Return Ratio to the Market: At the end of any given time, 
this ratio is calculated as the cumulative return of $Y invested in the 
company divided by the cumulative return of $Y invested in the general 
stock market, where the $Y is invested in both the company and the mar- 
ket on the same date. 
Transition Date (for good-to-great companies): The precise transition 
date for a good-to-great company is the date when the company's perfor- 
mance-in terms of cumulative stock returns relative to the general 
stock market-turns upward after a period of market to below -market 
performance, and never again falls below this point. 
3. Using University of Chicago Center for Research in Security Prices data, 
cumulative returns were calculated from December 31, 1984, to Decem - 
ber 31, 1999, for GE and the general market, all dividends reinvested, 
adjusted for stock splits. 
4. The chart on page 2 was created using the following methodology: 
======================================== [Página 261] ========================================

262 Notes 
1. For each good -to-great company, invest $1 at the transition date minus 
15 years. Also invest $1 in the general market. Calculate the cumulative 
stock return of $1 invested at the transition date minus 15 years through 
the transition date plus 15 years for the good -to-great company and the 
general market. In the case of CRSP data not being available (usuall y 
because the company was not yet publicly traded, merged, or was 
acquired), use market returns in lieu of company returns. 
2. For each good -to-great company, calculate the ratio of cumulative stock 
returns to the general market from t - 15 to t + 15 to create a "ratio of 
cumulative returns " curve. 
3. Shift this "ratio of cumulative returns curve " for each good -to-great 
company such that at the transition date, the ratio of cumulative stock 
returns to the market equals precisely 1. This shifts the transition dates 
for all the good -to-great companies to a common reference point-time 
t. Do this by dividing the ratio of cumulative stock returns to the market 
at each month (calculated in step 2) from t - 15 to t + 15 by the ratio of 
the cumulative stock return number calculated at precisely the transi - 
tion date. 
4. Use these shifted returns to calculate the average ratio of cumulative 
stock returns to the market across all eleven good -to-great companies at 
each month t - 15 to t + 15. In other words, calculate the average of the 
calculation in step 3 at t - 15 across all eleven companies, then t - 15 
plus 1 month for all eleven companies, plus 2 months, and so forth, for 
all 360 months. This creates the combined, cumulative returns relative 
to the market curve for the good -to-great companies. 
5. For each direct comparison company, repeat steps 1-3 above, using the 
same dates for the direct comparison company as for its counterpart 
good -to-great company. 
6. For the direct comparison companies as a set, repeat step 4 above. 
7. This chart shows the good -to-great companies versus the direct compar - 
ison companies, cumulative returns ratio to the market, t - 15 to t + 15, 
with t as a common reference point where the ratio to the market is set 
to 1.0. 
The chart on page 4 was created using the following methodology: 
1. For each good -to-great company, invest $1 on December 31, 1964 (the 
date of the first transition in our study). 
2. For each good -to-great company, calculate cumulative stock returns at 
the market rate of return through the transition -date month, then switch 
over to using returns from the good -to-great company. For any missing 
CRSP data (usually because the company was not yet publicl y traded, 
merged, or was acquired), use the market rate of return in lieu of com- 
pany returns. 
======================================== [Página 262] ========================================

Notes 263 
3. For each month from December 3 1,1964, through December 3 1,1999, 
add the cumulative returns across all eleven companies and divide by 11. 
This gives the cumulative return of $1 invested in the entire set. 
4. For the general market, invest $1 on December 31, 1964, and carry 
through December 3 1,1999. 
5. For each direct comparison company repeat steps 1-3, holding the 
company at the market rate until the date of transition for the corre - 
sponding good -to-great company. Notes: RJR held at market rate from 
May 3 1, 1989, to December 3 1, 1999, as the company emerged from its 
LBO in different pieces (RJR and Nabisco). 
6. This chart shows the market versus the comparison companies versus 
the good -to-great companies, the value of $1 invested from December 
3 1, 1964, to year 2000.

to Martin Gilbert, Churchill frequently consulted his Statistical Office, 
which was headed by a civilian, Professor Lindemenn, before he made 
critical decisions. He directly and continuously asked them to "check 
facts" on such important topics as munitions production, imports and 
shipping losses, aircraft losses, and aircraft production. Martin Gilbert,

(New York: Ballantine, 1988), 294. In her work, Stearns describes the 
findings of these studies, which we believe provide a scientific basis for 
understanding the effectiveness of the Stockdale Paradox. We were also 
influenced by the work of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. In his comprehen - 
sive investigation into the nature of happiness in the book Flow, Mihaly 
Csikszentmihalyi discusses the transformational potential of apparent 
tragedy, using as an example the studies of Professor Fausto Massimini of 
the University of Milan. In these studies, some paraplegics and other 
severely handicapped people asserted that their personal tragedies had 
actually resulted in a positive experience that led them to live fuller lives. 
(Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Flow [New York: Harperperennial, 19901, 
192-193.) For another viewpoint on this subject, also see the work of Dr. 
A1 Siebert, who wrote The Survivor Personality -How Life's Best Survivors

20. Prominent physicists of the time had already developed similar theories, 
bolstered by remarkably good experimental evidence, that were mathe - 
maticall y consistent and equivalent to Einstein's exposition of relativity 
theory. All they lacked was the clear statement of a fundamental principle 
to start the chain of thinking that resulted in a clear picture of relativity 
theory and its consequences. In Understanding Relativity, by Stanley 
Goldberg (Boston: Birkhauser, 1984), the author points out, "There was 
not complete satisfaction with the theory that Lorentz and PoincarC pro- 
duced in 1904, although that theory was formally identical to the theory 
that Einstein introduced a year later" (page 324). (Emphasis added.)
