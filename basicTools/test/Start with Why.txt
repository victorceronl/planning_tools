 ======================================== [Página 7] ========================================   1 INTRODUCTION   WHY START WITH WHY?   This book is about a naturally occurring pattern, a  way of thinking,  acting and communicating that gives some leaders th e ability to  inspire those around them. Although these "natural- born leaders"  may have come into the world with a predisposition to inspire, the  ability is not reserved for them exclusively. We ca n all learn this  pattern. With a little discipline, any leader or or ganization can in- spire others, both inside and outside their organiz ation, to help  advance their ideas and their vision. We can all le arn to lead.   The goal of this book is not simply to try to fix t he things that  aren't working. Rather, I wrote this book as a guid e to focus on and  amplify the things that do work. I do not aim to up set the solutions  offered by others. Most of the answers we get, when  based on sound  evidence, are perfectly valid. However, if we're st arting with the  wrong questions, if we don't understand the cause, then even the  right answers will always steer us wrong ... eventu ally. The truth,  you see, is always revealed... eventually.   The stories that follow are of those individuals an d organizations  that naturally embody this pattern. They are the on es that start with  Why.   

======================================== [Página 8] ======================================== 

START WITH WHY  2 1.     The goal was ambitious. Public interest was high. E xperts were  eager to contribute. Money was readily available.   Armed with every ingredient for success, Samuel Pie rpont  Langley set out in the early 1900s to be the first man to pilot an  airplane. Highly regarded, he was a senior officer at the Smithso- nian Institution, a mathematics professor who had a lso worked at  Harvard. His friends included some of the most powe rful men in  government and business, including Andrew Carnegie and Alexan- der Graham Bell. Langley was given a $50,000 grant from the War  Department to fund his project, a tremendous amount  of money for  the time. He pulled together the best minds of the day, a veritable  dream team of talent and know-how. Langley and his team used the  finest materials, and the press followed him everyw here. People all  over the country were riveted to the story, waiting  to read that he  had achieved his goal. With the team he had gathere d and ample  resources, his success was guaranteed.   Or was it?   A few hundred miles away, Wilbur and Orville Wright  were  working on their own flying machine. Their passion to fly was so  intense that it inspired the enthusiasm and commitm ent of a ded- icated group in their hometown of Dayton, Ohio. The re was no  funding for their venture. No government grants. No  high-level  connections. Not a single person on the team had an  advanced  degree or even a college education, not even Wilbur  or Orville. But  the team banded together in a humble bicycle shop a nd made their  vision real. On December 17, 1903, a small group wi tnessed a man  take flight for the first time in history.   How did the Wright brothers succeed where a better- equipped,  better-funded and better-educated team could not?   ======================================== [Página 9] ======================================== 

WHY STAR WITH WHY  3 It wasn't luck. Both the Wright brothers and Langle y were highly  motivated. Both had a strong work ethic. Both had k een scientific  minds. They were pursuing exactly the same goal, bu t only the  Wright brothers were able to inspire those around t hem and truly  lead their team to develop a technology that would change the  world. Only the Wright brothers started with Why.   2.   In 1965, students on the campus of the University o f California,  Berkeley, were the first to publicly burn their dra ft cards to protest  America's involvement in the Vietnam War. Northern California  was a hotbed of antigovernment and antiestablishmen t sentiment;  footage of clashes and riots in Berkeley and Oaklan d was beamed  around the globe, fueling sympathetic movements acr oss the United  States and Europe. But it wasn't until 1976, nearly  three years after  the end of America's military involvement in the Vi etnam conflict,  that a different revolution ignited.   They aimed to make an impact, a very big impact, ev en chal- lenge the way people perceived how the world worked . But these  young revolutionaries did not throw stones or take up arms against  an authoritarian regime. Instead, they decided to b eat the system at  its own game. For Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, the  cofounders of  Apple Computer, the battlefield was business and th e weapon of  choice was the personal computer.   The personal computer revolution was beginning to b rew when  Wozniak built the Apple I. Just starting to gain at tention, the tech- nology was primarily seen as a tool for business. C omputers were  too complicated and out of the price range of the a verage individ- ual. But Wozniak, a man not motivated by money, env isioned a  nobler purpose for the technology. He saw the perso nal computer  as a way for the little man to take on a corporatio n. If he could  

======================================== [Página 10] ======================================== 
START WITH WHY  4 figure out a way to get it in the hands of the indi vidual, he thought,  the computer would give nearly anyone the ability t o perform many  of the same functions as a vastly better resourced company. The  personal computer could level the playing field and  change the way  the world operated. Woz designed the Apple I, and i mproved the  technology with the Apple II, to be affordable and simple to use.   No matter how visionary or how brilliant, a great i dea or a great  product isn't worth much if no one buys it. Wozniak 's best friend at  the time, the twenty-one-year-old Steve Jobs, knew exactly what to  do. Though he had experience selling surplus electr onics parts, Jobs  would prove to be much more than a good salesman. H e wanted to  do something significant in the world, and building  a company was  how he was going to do it. Apple was the tool he us ed to ignite his  revolution.   In their first year in business, with only one prod uct, Apple  made a million dollars in revenues. By year two, th ey did $10 mil- lion in sales. In their fourth year they sold $100 million worth of  computers. And in just six years, Apple Computer wa s a billion-  dollar company with over 3,000 employees.   Jobs and Woz were not the only people taking part i n the per- sonal computer revolution. They weren't the only sm art guys in the  business; in fact, they didn't know much about busi ness at all. What  made Apple special was not their ability to build s uch a fast-growth  company. It wasn't their ability to think different ly about personal  computers. What has made Apple special is that they 've been able to  repeat the pattern over and over and over. Unlike a ny of their  competitors, Apple has successfully challenged conv entional think- ing within the computer industry, the small electro nics industry, the  music industry, the mobile phone industry and the b roader  entertainment industry. And the reason is simple. A pple inspires.  Apple starts with Why.

WHY STAR WITH WHY  5 3.   He was not perfect. He had his complexities. He was  not the only  one who suffered in a pre-civil rights America, and  there were  plenty of other charismatic speakers. But Martin Lu ther King Jr. had  a gift. He knew how to inspire people.   Dr. King knew that if the civil rights movement was  to succeed,  if there was to be a real, lasting change, it would  take more than him  and his closest allies. It would take more than rou sing words and  eloquent speeches. It would take people, tens of th ousands of  average citizens, united by a single vision, to cha nge the country. At  11:00 a.m. on August 28, 1963, they would send a me ssage to Wash- ington that it was time for America to steer a new course.   The organizers of the civil rights movement did not  send out  thousands of invitations, nor was there a Web site to check the date.  But the people came. And they kept coming and comin g. All told, a  quarter of a million people descended on the nation 's capital in time  to hear the words immortalized by history, delivere d by the man  who would lead a movement that would change America  forever: "I  have a dream."   The ability to attract so many people from across t he country, of  all colors and races, to join together on the right  day, at the right  time, took something special. Though others knew wh at had to  change in America to bring about civil rights for a ll, it was Martin  Luther King who was able to inspire a country to ch ange not just for  the good of a minority, but for the good of everyon e. Martin   Luther King started with Why.   .  .  .  There are leaders and there are those who lead. Wit h only 6 percent  market share in the United States and about 3 perce nt worldwide,  Apple is not a leading manufacturer of home compute rs. Yet the  company leads the computer industry and is now a le ader in other

START WITH WHY  6 industries as well. Martin Luther King's experience s were not  unique, yet he inspired a nation to change. The Wri ght brothers  were not the strongest contenders in the race to ta ke the first  manned, powered flight, but they led us into a new era of aviation  and, in doing so, completely changed the world we l ive in.   Their goals were not different than anyone else's, and their sys- tems and processes were easily replicated. Yet the Wright brothers,  Apple and Martin Luther King stand out among their peers. They  stand apart from the norm and their impact is not e asily copied.  They are members of a very select group of leaders who do some- thing very, very special. They inspire us.   Just about every person or organization needs to mo tivate others  to act for some reason or another. Some want to mot ivate a purchase  decision. Others are looking for support or a vote.  Still others are  keen to motivate the people around them to work har der or smarter  or just follow the rules. The ability to motivate p eople is not, in  itself, difficult. It is usually tied to some exter nal factor. Tempting  incentives or the threat of punishment will often e licit the behavior  we desire. General Motors, for example, so successf ully motivated  people to buy their products that they sold more ca rs than any other  automaker in the world for over seventy- seven year s. Though they  were leaders in their industry, they did not lead.   Great leaders, in contrast, are able to inspire peo ple to act. Those  who are able to inspire give people a sense of purp ose or belonging  that has little to do with any external incentive o r benefit to be  gained. Those who truly lead are able to create a f ollowing of people  who act not because they were swayed, but because t hey were  inspired. For those who are inspired, the motivatio n to act is deeply  personal. They are less likely to be swayed by ince ntives. Those who  are inspired are willing to pay a premium or endure  inconvenience,  even personal suffering. Those who are able to insp ire will create a  following of people—supporters, voters, customers, workers—who act for the good of the whole not because they have  to, but because  they want to.   Though relatively few in number, the organizations and leaders  with the natural ability to inspire us come in all shapes and sizes.  They can be found in both the public and private se ctors. They are  in all sorts of industries—selling to consumers or to other busi- nesses. Regardless of where they exist, they all ha ve a dispropor- tionate amount of influence in their industries. Th ey have the most  loyal customers and the most loyal employees. They tend to be more  profitable than others in their industry. They are more innovative,  and most importantly, they are able to sustain all these things over  the long term. Many of them change industries. Some  of them even  change the world.   The Wright brothers, Apple and Dr. King are just th ree exam-  pies. Harley-Davidson, Disney and Southwest Airline s are three  more. John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan were also a ble to inspire.  No matter from where they hail, they all have somet hing in  common. All the inspiring leaders and companies, re gardless of size  or industry, think, act and communicate exactly ali ke.   And it's the complete opposite of everyone else.   What if we could all learn to think, act and commun icate like  those who inspire? I imagine a world in which the a bility to inspire  is practiced not just by a chosen few, but by the m ajority. Studies  show that over 80 percent of Americans do not have their dream job.  If more knew how to build organizations that inspir e, we could live  in a world in which that statistic was the reverse— a world in which  over 80 percent of people loved their jobs. People who love going to  work are more productive and more creative. They go  home  happier and have happier families. They treat their  colleagues and  clients and customers better. Inspired employees ma ke for stronger  companies and stronger economies. That is why I wro te this book. I  hope to inspire others to do the things that inspir e them so that

This  book is not designed to tell you what to do or how to do it. Its goal  is not to give you a course of action. Its goal is to offer you the  cause   of action.   For those who have an open mind for new ideas, who seek to  create long-lasting success and who believe that yo ur success re- quires the aid of others, I offer you a challenge. From now on, start  with Why.    ======================================== [Página 15] ======================================== ASSUME YOU KNOW    9     PART I   A WORLD THAT  DOESN'T START  WITH WHY    ======================================== [Página 16] ======================================== START WITH WHY  10  ======================================== [Página 17] ========================================   11 1    ASSUME YOU KNOW   On a cold January day, a forty-three-year-old man w as  sworn in as the chief executive of his country. By his side  stood his predecessor, a famous general who, fiftee n years  earlier, had commanded his nation's armed forces in  a war  that resulted in the defeat of Germany. The young l eader  was raised in the Roman Catholic faith. He spent th e next  five hours watching parades in his honor and stayed  up  celebrating until three o'clock in the morning.   You know who I'm describing, right?   It's January 30, 1933, and I'm describing Adolf Hit ler and not, as  most people would assume, John F. Kennedy.   The point is, we make assumptions. We make assumpti ons about  the world around us based on sometimes incomplete o r false  information. In this case, the information I offere d was incomplete.  Many of you were convinced that I was describing Jo hn F. Kennedy  until I added one minor little detail: the date.   This is important because our behavior is affected by our as- sumptions or our perceived truths. We make decision s based on  what we  think  we know. It wasn't too long ago that the majority of  ======================================== [Página 18] ======================================== START WITH WHY  12 people believed the world was flat. This perceived truth impacted  behavior. During this period, there was very little  exploration. Peo- ple feared that if they traveled too far they might  fall off the edge of  the earth. So for the most part they stayed put. It  wasn't until that  minor detail was revealed—the world is round—that b ehaviors  changed on a massive scale. Upon this discovery, so cieties began to  traverse the planet. Trade routes were established;  spices were  traded. New ideas, like mathematics, were shared be tween societies  which unleashed all kinds of innovations and advanc ements. The  correction of a simple false assumption moved the h uman race  forward.   Now consider how organizations are formed and how d ecisions  are made. Do we really know why some organizations succeed and  why others don't, or do we just assume? No matter y our definition  of success—hitting a target stock price, making a c ertain amount of  money, meeting a revenue or profit goal, getting a big promotion,  starting your own company, feeding the poor, winnin g public  office—how we go about achieving our goals is very similar. Some  of us just wing it, but most of us try to at least gather some data so  we can make educated decisions. Sometimes this gath ering process  is formal—like conducting polls or market research.  And sometimes  it's informal, like asking our friends and colleagu es for advice or  looking back on our own personal experience to prov ide some  perspective. Regardless of the process or the goals , we all want to  make educated decisions. More importantly, we all w ant to make  the  right  decisions.   As we all know, however, not all decisions work out  to be the  right ones, regardless of the amount of data we col lect. Sometimes  the impact of those wrong decisions is minor, and s ometimes it can  be catastrophic. Whatever the result, we make decis ions based on a  perception of the world that may not, in fact, be c ompletely accu- rate. Just as so many were certain that I was descr ibing John F.  ======================================== [Página 19] ======================================== ASSUME YOU KNOW    13 Kennedy at the beginning of this section. You were certain you were  right. You might even have bet money on it—a behavi or based on  an assumption. Certain, that is, until I offered th at little detail of the  date.   Not only bad decisions are made on false assumption s. Some- times when things go right, we think we know why, b ut do we re- ally? That the result went the way you wanted does not mean you  can repeat it over and over. I have a friend who in vests some of his  own money. Whenever he does well, it's because of h is brains and  ability to pick the right stocks, at least accordin g to him. But when  he loses money, he always blames the market. I have  no issue with  either line of logic, but either his success and fa ilure hinge upon his  own prescience and blindness or they hinge upon goo d and bad  luck. But it can't be both.   So how can we ensure that all our decisions will yi eld the best  results for reasons that are fully within our contr ol? Logic dictates  that more information and data are key. And that's exactly what we  do. We read books, attend conferences, listen to po dcasts and ask  friends and colleagues—all with the purpose of find ing out more so  we can figure out what to do or how to act. The pro blem is, we've all  been in situations in which we have all the data an d get lots of good  advice but things still don't go quite right. Or ma ybe the impact  lasted for only a short time, or something happened  that we could  not foresee. A quick note to all of you who correct ly guessed Adolf  Hitler at the beginning of the section: the details  I gave are the same  for both Hitler and John F. Kennedy, it could have been either. You  have to be careful what you think you know. Asumpti ons, you see,  even when based on sound research, can lead us astr ay.   Intuitively we understand this. We understand that even with  mountains of data and good advice, if things don't go as expected,  it's probably because we missed one, sometimes smal l but vital de- tail. In these cases, we go back to all our sources , maybe seek out  ======================================== [Página 20] ======================================== START WITH WHY  14 some new ones, and try to figure out what to do, an d the whole  process begins again. More data, however, doesn't a lways help, es- pecially if a flawed assumption set the whole proce ss in motion in  the first place. There are other factors that must be considered, fac- tors that exist outside of our rational, analytical , information-  hungry brains.   There are times in which we had no data or we chose  to ignore  the advice or information at hand and just went wit h our gut and  things worked out just fine, sometimes even better than expected.  This dance between gut and rational decision-making  pretty much  covers how we conduct business and even live our li ves. We can  continue to slice and dice all the options in every  direction, but at  the end of all the good advice and all the compelli ng evidence,  we're left where we started: how to explain or deci de a course of  action that yields a desired effect that is repeata ble. How can we  have 20/20 foresight?   There is a wonderful story of a group of American c ar executives  who went to Japan to see a Japanese assembly line. At the end of the  line, the doors were put on the hinges, the same as  in America. But  something was missing. In the United States, a line  worker would  take a rubber mallet and tap the edges of the door to ensure that it  fit perfectly. In Japan, that job didn't seem to ex ist. Confused, the  American auto executives asked at what point they m ade sure the  door fit perfectly. Their Japanese guide looked at them and smiled  sheepishly. "We make sure it fits when we design it ." In the  Japanese auto plant, they didn't examine the proble m and  accumulate data to figure out the best solution—the y engineered  the outcome they wanted from the beginning. If they  didn't achieve  their desired outcome, they understood it was becau se of a decision  they made at the start of the process.   At the end of the day, the doors on the American-ma de and  Japanese-made cars appeared to fit when each rolled  off the as- ======================================== [Página 21] ======================================== ASSUME YOU KNOW    15 sembly line. Except the Japanese didn't need to emp loy someone to  hammer doors, nor did they need to buy any mallets.  More impor- tantly, the Japanese doors are likely to last longe r and maybe even  be more structurally sound in an accident. All this  for no other  reason than they ensured the pieces fit from the st art.   What the American automakers did with their rubber mallets is  a metaphor for how so many people and organizations  lead. When  faced with a result that doesn't go according to pl an, a series of  perfectly effective short-term tactics are used unt il the desired out-  come is achieved. But how structurally sound are th ose solutions?  So many organizations function in a world of tangib le goals and the  mallets to achieve them. The ones that achieve more , the ones that  get more out of fewer people and fewer resources, t he ones with an  outsized amount of influence, however, build produc ts and com- panies and even recruit people that all fit based o n the original  intention. Even though the outcome may look the sam e, great lead- ers understand the value in the things we cannot se e.   Every instruction we give, every course of action w e set, every  result we desire, starts with the same thing: a dec ision. There are  those who decide to manipulate the door to fit to a chieve the desired  result and there are those who start from somewhere  very different.  Though both courses of action may yield similar sho rt- term results,  it is what we can't see that makes long-term succes s more  predictable for only one. The one that understood w hy the doors  need to fit by design and not by default.    ======================================== [Página 22] ========================================   16  ======================================== [Página 23] ========================================   17 2  CARROTS AND STICKS   Manipulation vs. Inspiration   There's barely a product or service on the market t oday that cus- tomers can't buy from someone else for about the sa me price, about  the same quality, about the same level of service a nd about the same  features. If you truly have a first-mover's advanta ge, it's probably  lost in a matter of months. If you offer something truly novel,  someone else will soon come up with something simil ar and maybe  even better.   But if you ask most businesses why their customers are their  customers, most will tell you it's because of super ior quality, fea- tures, price or service. In other words, most compa nies have no clue  why their customers are their customers. This is a fascinating  realization. If companies don't know why their cust omers are their  customers, odds are good that they don't know why t heir employees  are their employees either.   If most companies don't really know why their custo mers are  their customers or why their employees are their em ployees, then  ======================================== [Página 24] ======================================== START WITH WHY  18 how do they know how to attract more employees and encourage  loyalty among those they already have? The reality is, most busi- nesses today are making decisions based on a set of  incomplete or,  worse, completely flawed assumptions about what's d riving their  business.   There are only two ways to influence human behavior : you can  manipulate it or you can inspire it. When I mention  manipulation,  this is not necessarily pejorative; it's a very com mon and fairly be- nign tactic. In fact, many of us have been doing it  since we were  young. "I'll be your best friend" is the highly eff ective negotiating  tactic employed by generations of children to obtai n something they  want from a peer. And as any child who has ever han ded over  candy hoping for a new best friend will tell you, i t works.   From business to politics, manipulations run rampan t in all  forms of sales and marketing. Typical manipulations  include: drop- ping the price; running a promotion; using fear, pe er pressure or  aspirational messages; and promising innovation to influence  behavior—be it a purchase, a vote or support. When companies or  organizations do not have a clear sense of why thei r customers are  their customers, they tend to rely on a disproporti onate number of  manipulations to get what they need. And for good r eason. Ma- nipulations work.   Price   Many companies are reluctant to play the price game , but they do  so because they know it is effective. So effective,  in fact, that the  temptation can sometimes be overwhelming. There are  few profes- sional services firms that, when faced with an oppo rtunity to land a  big piece of business, haven't just dropped their p rice to make the  deal happen. No matter how they rationalized it to themselves or  their clients, price is a highly effective manipula tion. Drop your  prices low enough and people will buy from you. We see it at the  ======================================== [Página 25] ======================================== CARROTS AND STICKS  19 end of a retail season when products are "priced to  move." Drop the  price low enough and the shelves will very quickly clear to make  room for the next season's products.   Playing the price game, however, can come at tremen dous cost  and can create a significant dilemma for the compan y. For the seller,  selling based on price is like heroin. The short-te rm gain is fantastic,  but the more you do it, the harder it becomes to ki ck the habit. Once  buyers get used to paying a lower-than-average pric e for a product  or service, it is very hard to get them to pay more . And the sellers,  facing overwhelming pressure to push prices lower a nd lower in  order to compete, find their margins cut slimmer an d slimmer. This  only drives a need to sell more to compensate. And the quickest  way to do that is price again. And so the downward spiral of price  addiction sets in. In the drug world, these addicts  are called junkies.  In the business world, we call them commodities. In surance. Home  computers. Mobile phone service. Any number of pack aged goods.  The list of commodities created by the price game g oes on and on.  In nearly every circumstance, the companies that ar e forced to treat  their products as commodities brought it upon thems elves. I cannot  debate that dropping the price is not a perfectly l egitimate way of  driving business; the challenge is staying profitab le.   Wal-Mart seems to be an exception to the rule. They  have built a  phenomenally successful business playing the price game. But it  also came at a high cost. Scale helped Wal-Mart avo id the inherent  weaknesses of a price strategy, but the company's o bsession with  price above all else has left it scandal-ridden and  hurt its reputation.  And every one of the company's scandals was born fr om its  attempts to keep costs down so it could afford to o ffer such low  prices.   Price always costs something. The question is, how much are  you willing to pay for the money you make?   ======================================== [Página 26] ======================================== START WITH WHY  20 Promotions   General Motors had a bold goal. To lead the America n automotive  industry in market share. In the 1950s there were f our choices of car  manufacturer in the United States: GM, Ford, Chrysl er and AMC.  Before foreign automakers entered the field, GM dom inated. New  competition, as one would expect, made that goal ha rder to  maintain. I don't need to provide any data to expla in how much has  changed in the auto industry in fifty years. But Ge neral Motors held  fast through most of the last century and maintaine d its prized  dominance.   Since 1990, however, Toyota's share of the U.S. mar ket has more  than doubled. By 2007, Toyota's share had climbed t o 16.3 percent,  from only 7.8 percent. During the same period, GM s aw its U.S.  market share drop dramatically from 35 percent in 1 990 to 23.8  percent in 2007. And in early 2008, the unthinkable  happened: U.S.  consumers bought more foreign-made automobiles than  ones made  in America.   Since the 1990s, faced with this onslaught of compe tition from  Japan, GM and the other U.S. automakers have scramb led to offer  incentives aimed at helping them hold on to their d windling share.  Heavily promoted with advertising, GM, for one, has  offered cash-  back incentives of between $500 and $7,000 to custo mers who  bought their cars and trucks. For a long time the p romotions  worked brilliantly. GM's sales were on the rise aga in.   But in the long term the incentives only helped to dramatically  erode GM's profit margins and put them in a deep ho le. In 2007,  GM lost $729 per vehicle, in large part due to ince ntives. Realizing  that the model was unsustainable, GM announced it w ould reduce  the amount of the cash-back incentives it offered, and with that  reduction, sales plummeted. No cash, no customers. The auto in- dustry had effectively created cash-back junkies ou t of customers,  building an expectation that there's no such thing as full price.   ======================================== [Página 27] ======================================== CARROTS AND STICKS  21 Whether it is "two for one" or "free toy inside," p romotions are  such common manipulations that we often forget that  we're being  manipulated in the first place. Next time you're in  the market for a  digital camera, for example, pay attention to how y ou make your  decision. You'll easily find two or three cameras w ith the spec- ifications you need—size, number of megapixels, com parable price,  good brand name. But perhaps one has a promotion—a free  carrying case or free memory card. Given the relati ve parity of the  features and benefits, that little something extra is sometimes all it  takes to tip the scale. In the business-to-business  world, pro-  motions are called "value added." But the principle s are the same—  give something away for free to reduce the risk so that someone will  do business with you. And like price, promotions wo rk.   The manipulative nature of promotions is so well es tablished in  retail that the industry even named one of the prin ciples. They call it  breakage. Breakage measures the percentage of custo mers who fail  to take advantage of a promotion and end up paying full price for a  product instead. This typically happens when buyers  don't bother  performing the necessary steps to claim their rebat es, a process pur- posely kept complicated or inconvenient to increase  the likelihood  of mistakes or inaction to keep that breakage numbe r up.  Rebates typically require the customer to send in a  copy of a  receipt, cut out a bar code from the packaging and painstakingly fill  out a rebate form with details about the product an d how it was  purchased. Sending in the wrong part of the box or leaving out a  detail on the application can delay the rebate for weeks, months, or  void it altogether. The rebate industry also has a name for the num- ber of customers who just don't bother to apply for  the rebate, or  who never cash the rebate check they receive. That' s called slippage.   For businesses, the short-term benefits of rebates and other ma- nipulations are clear: a rebate lures customers to pay full price for a  product that they may have considered buying only b ecause of the  ======================================== [Página 28] ======================================== START WITH WHY  22 prospect of a partial refund. But nearly 40 percent  of those custom- ers never get the lower price they thought they wer e paying. Call it  a tax on the disorganized, but retailers rely on it .   Regulators have stepped up their scrutiny of the re bate industry,  but with only limited success. The rebate process r emains cumber- some and that means free money for the seller. Mani pulation at its  best. But at what cost?   Fear   If someone were to hold up a bank with a banana in his pocket, he  would be charged with armed robbery. Clearly, no vi ctim was in  any danger of being shot, but it is the belief that  the robber has a  real gun that is considered by the law. And for goo d reason.  Knowing full well that fear will motivate them to c omply with his  demands, the robber took steps to make his victims afraid. Fear, real  or perceived, is arguably the most powerful manipul ation of the lot.   "No one ever got fired for hiring IBM," goes the ol d adage, de- scribing a behavior completely borne out of fear. A n employee in a  procurement department, tasked with finding the bes t suppliers for  a company, turns down a better product at a better price simply  because it is from a smaller company or lesser-know n brand. Fear,  real or perceived, that his job would be on the lin e if something  went wrong was enough to make him ignore the expres s purpose of  his job, even do something that was not in the comp any's best  interest.   When fear is employed, facts are incidental. Deeply  seated in our  biological drive to survive, that emotion cannot be  quickly wiped  away with facts and figures. This is how terrorism works. It's not  the statistical probability that one could get hurt  by a terrorist, but  it's the fear that it might happen that cripples a population.   A powerful manipulator, fear is often used with far  less nefari- ous motivations. We use fear to raise our kids. We use fear to mo- ======================================== [Página 29] ======================================== CARROTS AND STICKS  23 tivate people to obey a code of ethics. Fear is reg ularly used in  public service ads, say to promote child safety or AIDS awareness,  or the need to wear seat belts. Anyone who was watc hing television  in the 1980s got a heavy dose of antidrug advertisi ng, including one  often-mimicked public service ad from a federal pro gram to combat  drug abuse among teenagers: "This is your brain," t he man's voice  said as he held up a pristine white egg. Then he cr acked the egg into  a frying pan of spattering hot oil. "This is your b rain on drug. Any  questions?"   And another ad intended to scare the hell out of an y brash teen- ager: "Cocaine doesn't make you sexy... it makes yo u dead."   Likewise, when politicians say that their opponent will raise  taxes or cut spending on law enforcement, or the ev ening news  alerts you that your health or security are at risk  unless you tune in  at eleven, both are attempting to seed fear among v oters and view- ers, respectively. Businesses also use fear to agit ate the insecurity  we all have in order to sell products. The idea is that if you don't  buy the product or service, something bad could hap pen to you.   "Every thirty-six seconds, someone dies of a heart attack," states  an ad for a local cardiac specialist. "Do you have radon? Your neigh- bor does!" reads the ad on the side of a truck for some company  selling a home-pollution-inspection service. And, o f course, the  insurance industry would like to sell you term life  insurance "before  it's too late."   If anyone has ever sold you anything with a warning  to fear the  consequences if you don't buy it, they are using a proverbial gun to  your head to help you see the "value" of choosing t hem over their  competitor. Or perhaps it's just a banana. But it w orks.   Aspirations   "Quitting smoking is the easiest thing I've ever do ne," said Mark  Twain. "I've done it hundreds of times."   ======================================== [Página 30] ======================================== START WITH WHY  24 If fear motivates us to move away from something ho rrible,  aspirational messages tempt us toward something des irable.  Marketers often talk about the importance of being aspirational,  offering someone something they desire to achieve a nd the ability to  get there more easily with a particular product or service. "Six steps  to a happier life." "Work those abs to your dream d ress size!" "In six  short weeks you can be rich." All these messages ma nipulate. They  tempt us with the things we want to have or to be t he person we  wish we were.   Though positive in nature, aspirational messages ar e most ef- fective with those who lack discipline or have a na gging fear or  insecurity that they don't have the ability to achi eve their dreams on  their own (which, at various times for various reas ons, is everyone).  I always joke that you can get someone to buy a gym  membership  with an aspirational message, but to get them to go  three days a  week requires a bit of inspiration. Someone who liv es a healthy  lifestyle and is in a habit of exercising does not respond to "six easy  steps to losing weight." It's those who don't have the lifestyle that  are most susceptible. It's not news that a lot of p eople try diet after  diet after diet in an attempt to get the body of th eir dreams. And no  matter the regime they choose, each comes with the qualification  that regular exercise and a balanced diet will help  boost results. In  other words, discipline. Gym memberships tend to ri se about 12  percent every January, as people try to fulfill the ir New Year's  aspiration to live a healthier life. Yet only a fra ction of those  aspiring fitness buffs are still attending the gym by the end of the  year. Aspirational messages can spur behavior, but for most, it  won't last.   Aspirational messages are not only effective in the  consumer  market, they also work quite well in business-to-bu siness transac- tions. Managers of companies, big and small, all wa nt to do well, so  they make decisions, hire consultants and implement  systems to  ======================================== [Página 31] ======================================== CARROTS AND STICKS  25 help them achieve that desired outcome. But all too  often, it is not  the systems that fail but the ability to maintain t hem. I can speak  from personal experience here. I've implemented a l ot of systems or  practices over the years to help me "achieve the su ccess to which I  aspire," only to find myself back to my old habits two weeks later. I  aspire for a system that will help me avoid impleme nting systems to  meet all my aspirations. But I probably wouldn't be  able to follow it  for very long.   This short-term response to long-term desires is al ive and well in  the corporate world also. A management consultant f riend of mine  was hired by a billion-dollar company to help it fu lfill its goals and  aspirations. The problem was, she explained, no mat ter the issue,  the company's managers were always drawn to the qui cker, cheaper  option over the better long-term solution. Just lik e the habitual  dieter, "they never have the time or money to do it  right the first  time," she said of her client, "but they always hav e the time and  money to do it again."   Peer Pressure   "Four out of five dentists prefer Trident," touts t he chewing gum  advertisement in an attempt to get you to try their  product. "A  double-blind study conducted at a top university co ncluded . . ."  pushes a late-night infomercial. "If the product is  good enough for  professionals, it's good enough for you," the adver tising eggs on.  "With over a million satisfied customers and counti ng," teases an- other ad. These are all forms of peer pressure. Whe n marketers  report that a majority of a population or a group o f experts prefers  their product over another, they are attempting to sway the buyer to  believing that whatever they are selling is better.  The peer pressure  works because we believe that the majority or the e xperts might  know more than we do. Peer pressure works not becau se the  majority or the experts are always right, but becau se we fear that we  may be wrong.   ======================================== [Página 32] ======================================== START WITH WHY  26 Celebrity endorsements are sometimes used to add pe er pressure  to the sales pitch. "If he uses it," we're supposed  to think, "it must be  good." This makes sense when we hear Tiger Woods en dorse Nike  golf products or Titleist golf balls. (Woods's deal  with Nike is  actually credited for putting the company on the ma p in the golf  world.) But Tiger has also endorsed General Motors cars, man- agement consulting services, credit cards, food and  a Tag Heuer  watch designed "especially for the golfer." The wat ch, incidentally,  can withstand a 5,000-g shock, a level of shock mor e likely experi- enced by the golf ball than the golfer. But Tiger e ndorsed it, so it  must be good. Celebrity endorsements are also used to appeal to our  aspirations and our desires to be like them. The mo st explicit  example was Gatorade's "I wanna be like Mike" campa ign, which  tempted youngsters to grow up and be just like Mich ael Jordan if  they drink Gatorade. With many other examples of ce lebrity en- dorsements, however, it is harder to see the connec tion. Sam Water-  ston of  Law & Order  fame, for example, sells online trading from TD  Ameritrade. But for his celebrity, it's uncertain w hat an actor famed  for convicting homicidal maniacs does for the brand . I guess he's  "trustworthy."   Impressionable youth are not the only ones subject to peer  pressure. Most of us have probably had an experienc e of being  pressured by a salesman. Have you ever had a sales rep try to sell  you some "office solution" by telling you that 70 p ercent of your  competitors are using their service, so why aren't you? But what if  70 percent of your competitors are idiots? Or what if that 70 percent  were given so much value added or offered such a lo w price that  they couldn't resist the opportunity? The practice is designed to do  one thing and one thing only—to pressure you to buy . To make you  feel you might be missing out on something or that everyone else  knows but you. Better to go with the majority, righ t?   ======================================== [Página 33] ======================================== CARROTS AND STICKS  27 To quote my mother, "If your friends put their head  in the oven,  would you do that too?" Sadly, if Michael Jordan or  Tiger Woods  was paid to do just that, it might actually start a  trend.   Novelty (a.k.a. Innovation)   "In a major innovation in design and engineering, [ Motorola] has  created a phone of firsts," read a 2004 press relea se that announced  the launch of the mobile phone manufacturer's newes t entry to the  ultracompetitive mobile phone market. "The combinat ion of metals,  such as aircraft-grade aluminum, with new advances,  such as an  internal antenna and a chemically-etched keypad, le d to the for- mation of a device that measures just 13.9mm thin."   And it worked. Millions of people rushed to get one . Celebrities  flashed their RAZRs on the red carpet. Even a prime  minister or two  was seen talking on one. Having sold over 50 millio n units, few  could argue that the RAZR wasn't a huge success. "B y surpassing  current mobile expectations, the RAZR represents Mo torola's his- tory of delivering revolutionary innovations," said  former Motorola  CEO Ed Zander of his new wunder-product, "while set ting a new  bar for future products coming out of the wireless industry."   This one product was a huge financial success for M otorola. This  was truly an innovation of monumental proportions.   Or was it?   Less than four years later, Zander was forced out. The stock  traded at 50 percent of its average value since the  launch of the  RAZR, and Motorola's competitors had easily surpass ed the RAZR's  features and functionalities with equally innovativ e new phones.  Motorola was once again rendered just another mobil e phone  manufacturer fighting for its piece of the pie. Lik e so many before it,  the company confused innovation with novelty.   ======================================== [Página 34] ======================================== START WITH WHY  28 Real innovation changes the course of industries or  even society.  The light bulb, the microwave oven, the fax machine , iTunes. These  are true innovations that changed how we conduct bu siness, altered  how we live our lives, and, in the case of iTunes, challenged an  industry to completely reevaluate its business mode l. Adding a  camera to a mobile phone, for example, is not an in novation— a  great feature, for sure, but not industry-altering.  With this revised  definition in mind, even Motorola's own description  of its new  product becomes just a list of a few great features : a metal case,  hidden antenna, flat keypad and a thin phone. Hardl y "revolution- ary innovation." Motorola had successfully designed  the latest shiny  object for people to get excited about ... at least  until a new shiny  object came out. And that's the reason these featur es are more a  novelty than an innovation. They are added in an at tempt to dif- ferentiate, but not reinvent. It's not a bad thing,  but it can't be  counted on to add any long-term value. Novelty can drive sales—  the RAZR proved it—but the impact does not last. If  a company  adds too many novel ideas too often, it can have a similar impact on  the product or category as the price game. In an at tempt to dif- ferentiate with more features, the products start t o look and feel  more like commodities. And, like price, the need to  add yet another  product to the line to compensate for the commoditi zation ends in a  downward spiral.   In the 1970s, there were only two types of Colgate toothpaste.  But as competition increased, Colgate's sales start ed to slip. So the  company introduced a new product that included a ne w feature, the  addition of fluoride, perhaps. Then another. Then a nother. Whit- ening. Tartar control. Sparkles. Stripes. Each inno vation certainly  helped boost sales, for a while at least. And so th e cycle continued.  Guess how many different types of toothpaste Colgat e has for you  to choose from today? Thirty-two. Today there are t hirty-two dif- ferent types of Colgate toothpaste (excluding the f our they make for  ======================================== [Página 35] ======================================== CARROTS AND STICKS  29 kids). And given how each company responds to the " innovations"  of the other, that means that Colgate's competitors  also sell a similar  number of variants that offer about the same qualit y, about the same  benefits, at about the same price. There are litera lly dozens and  dozens of toothpastes to choose from, yet there is no data to show  that Americans are brushing their teeth more now th an they were in  the 1970s. Thanks to all this "innovation," it has become almost  impossible to know which toothpaste is right for yo u. So much so  that even Colgate offers a link on their Web site c alled "Need Help  Deciding?" If Colgate needs to help us pick one of their products  because there are too many variations, how are we s upposed to  decide when we go to the supermarket without their Web site to  help us?   Once again, this is an example of the newest set of  shiny objects  designed to encourage a trial or a purchase. What c ompanies clev- erly disguise as "innovation" is in fact novelty. A nd it's not only  packaged goods that rely on novelty to lure custome rs; it's a com- mon practice in other industries, too. It works, bu t rarely if ever  does the strategy cement any loyal relationships.   Apple's iPhone has since replaced the Motorola RAZR  as the  popular must-have new mobile phone. Removing all th e buttons  and putting a touch screen is not what makes the iP hone innovative,  however. Those are brilliant new features. But othe rs can copy those  things and it wouldn't redefine the category. There  is something  else that Apple did that is vastly more significant .   Apple is not only leading how mobile phones are des igned, but,  in typical Apple fashion, also how the industry fun ctions. In the  mobile phone industry, it is the service provider, not the phone  manufacturer, that determines all the features and benefits the  phone can offer. T-Mobile, Verizon Wireless, Sprint , AT&T all dic- tate to Motorola, Nokia, Ericsson, LG and others wh at the phones  will do. Then Apple showed up. They announced that they would  ======================================== [Página 36] ======================================== START WITH WHY  30 tell the service provider what the phone would do, not the other  way around. AT&T was the only one that agreed, thus  earning the  company the exclusive deal to offer the new technol ogy. That's the  kind of shift that will impact the industry for man y years and will  extend far beyond a few years of stock boost for th e shiny new  product.   Novel, huh?   The Price You Pay for the Money You Make   I cannot dispute that manipulations work. Every one  of them can  indeed help influence behavior and every one of the m can help a  company become quite successful. But there are trad e-offs. Not a  single one of them breeds loyalty. Over the course of time, they cost  more and more. The gains are only short-term. And t hey increase  the level of stress for both the buyer and the sell er. If you have ex- ceptionally deep pockets or are looking to achieve only a short-  term gain with no consideration for the long term, then these  strategies and tactics are perfect.   Beyond the business world, manipulations are the no rm in pol- itics today as well. Just as manipulations can driv e a sale but not  create loyalty, so too can they help a candidate ge t elected, but they  don't create a foundation for leadership. Leadershi p requires people  to stick with you through thick and thin. Leadershi p is the ability to  rally people not for a single event, but for years.  In business,  leadership means that customers will continue to su pport your  company even when you slip up. If manipulation is t he only strat- egy, what happens the next time a purchase decision  is required?  What happens after the election is won?   There is a big difference between repeat business a nd loyalty.  Repeat business is when people do business with you  multiple  times. Loyalty is when people are willing to turn d own a better  product or a better price to continue doing busines s with you. Loyal  ======================================== [Página 37] ======================================== CARROTS AND STICKS  31 customers often don't even bother to research the c ompetition or  entertain other options. Loyalty is not easily won.  Repeat business,  however, is. All it takes is more manipulations.   Manipulative techniques have become such a mainstay  in  American business today that it has become virtuall y impossible for  some to kick the habit. Like any addiction, the dri ve is not to get  sober, but to find the next fix faster and more fre quently. And as  good as the short-term highs may feel, they have a deleterious im- pact on the long-term health of an organization. Ad dicted to the  short-term results, business today has largely beco me a series of  quick fixes added on one after another after anothe r. The short-  term tactics have become so sophisticated that an e ntire economy  has developed to service the manipulations, equippe d with statistics  and quasi-science. Direct marketing companies, for example, offer  calculations about which words will get the best re sults on each  piece of direct mail they send out.   Those that offer mail-in rebates know the incentive  works and  they know that the higher the rebate, the more effe ctive it is. They  also know the cost that goes along with those rebat es. To make  them profitable, manufacturers rely on the breakage  and slippage  numbers staying above a certain threshold. Just lik e our trusty drug  addict, whose behavior is reinforced by how good th e short-term  high feels, the temptation to make the qualificatio ns of the rebate  more obscure or cumbersome so as to reduce the numb er of qual- ified applicants can be overwhelming for some.   Samsung, the electronics giant, mastered the art of  the kind of  fine print that makes rebates so profitable for com panies. In the  early 2000s, the company offered rebates up to $150  on a variety of  electronic products, stipulating in the fine print that the rebate was  limited to one per address—a requirement that would  have  sounded reasonable enough to anyone at the time. Ye t in practice, it  effectively disqualified all customers who lived in  apartment  ======================================== [Página 38] ======================================== START WITH WHY  32 buildings where more than one resident had applied for the same  rebate. More than 4,000 Samsung customers lured by the cash back  received notices denying them rebates on those grou nds. The prac- tice was brought to the attention of the New York a ttorney general,  and in 2004 Samsung was ordered to pay $200,000 in rebate claims  to apartment dwellers. This is an extreme case of a  company that  got caught. But the rebate game of cutting out UPC symbols, filling  out forms and doing it all before the deadline is a live and well. How  can a company claim to be customer-focused when the y are so  comfortable measuring the number of customers who w ill fail to  realize any promise of savings?   Manipulations Lead to Transactions, Not Loyalty   "It's simple," explains the TV infomercial, "simply  put your old gold  jewelry in the prepaid, insured envelope and we'll send you a check  for the value of the gold in just two days." Mygold envelope .com is  one of the leaders in this industry, serving as a b roker for gold to be  sent to a refinery, melted down, and reintroduced i nto the  commodity market.   When Douglas Feirstein and Michael Moran started th e com- pany, they wanted to be the best in the business. T hey wanted to  transform an industry with the reputation of a back -alley pawn  shop and give it a bit of a Tiffany's sheen. They i nvested money in  making the experience perfect. They worked to make the customer  service experience ideal. They were both successful  entrepreneurs  and knew the value of building a brand and a strong  customer  experience. They'd spent a lot of money trying to g et the balance  right, and they made sure to explain their differen ce in direct re- sponse advertising on various local and national ca ble stations.  "Better than the similar offers," they'd say. And t hey were right. But  the investment didn't pay off as expected.   ======================================== [Página 39] ======================================== CARROTS AND STICKS  33 A few months later, Feirstein and Moran made a sign ificant dis- covery: almost all of their customers did business with them only  once. They had a transactional business yet they we re trying to  make it so much more than that. So they stopped try ing to make  their service "better than similar offers," and ins tead settled with  good. Given that most people were not going to beco me repeat  customers, there weren't going to be any head-to-he ad comparisons  made to the other services. All they needed to do w as drive a  purchase decision and offer a pleasant enough exper ience that  people would recommend it to a friend. Any more was  unneces- sary. Once the owners of mygoldenvelope.com realize d they didn't  need to invest in the things that build loyalty if all they wanted to  do was drive transactions, their business became va stly more effi- cient and more profitable.   For transactions that occur an average of once, car rots and sticks  are the best way to elicit the desired behavior. Wh en the police offer  a reward they are not looking to nurture a relation ship with the  witness or tipster; it is just a single transaction . When you lose your  kitten and offer a reward to get it back, you don't  need to have a  lasting relationship with the person returning it; you just want your  cat back.   Manipulations are a perfectly valid strategy for dr iving a trans- action, or for any behavior that is only required o nce or on rare  occasions. The rewards the police use are designed to incentivize  witnesses to come forward to provide tips or eviden ce that may  lead to an arrest. And, like any promotion, the man ipulation will  work if the incentive feels high enough to mitigate  the risk.   In any circumstance in which a person or organizati on wants  more than a single transaction, however, if there i s a hope for a  loyal, lasting relationship, manipulations do not h elp. Does a poli- tician want your vote, for example, or does he or s he want a lifetime  of support and loyalty from you? (Judging by how el ections are run  ======================================== [Página 40] ======================================== START WITH WHY  34 these days, it seems all they want is to win electi ons. Ads discredit- ing opponents, a focus on single issues, and an unc omfortable reli- ance on fear or aspirational desires are all indica tors. Those tactics  win elections, but they do not seed loyalties among  the voters.)   The American car industry learned the hard way the high cost of  relying on manipulations to build a business when l oyalty was what  they really needed to nurture. While manipulations may be a viable  strategy when times are good and money is flush, a change in  market conditions made them too expensive. When the  oil crisis of  2008 hit, the auto industry's promotions and incent ives became  untenable (the same thing happened in the 1970s). I n this case, how  long the manipulations could produce short-term gai ns was defined  by the length of time the economy could sustain the  strategy. This is  a fundamentally weak platform upon which to build a  business, an  assumption of never-ending boom. Though loyal custo mers are less  tempted by other offers and incentives, in good tim es the free flow  of business makes it hard to recognize their value.  It's in the tough  times that loyal customers matter most.   Manipulations work, but they cost money. Lots of mo ney. When  the money is not as available to fund those tactics , not having a loyal  following really hurts. After September 11, there w ere customers  who sent checks to Southwest Airlines to show their  support. One  note that accompanied a check for $1,000 read, "You 've been so good  to me over the years, in these hard times I wanted to say thank you  by helping you out." The checks that Southwest Airl ines received  were certainly not enough to make any significant i mpact on the  company's bottom line, but they were symbolic of th e feeling  customers had for the brand. They had a sense of pa rtnership. The  loyal behavior of those who didn't send money is al most impossible  to measure, but its impact has been invaluable over  the long term,  helping Southwest to maintain its position as the m ost profitable  airline in history.   ======================================== [Página 41] ======================================== CARROTS AND STICKS  35 Knowing you have a loyal customer and employee base  not only  reduces costs, it provides massive peace of mind. L ike loyal friends,  you know your customers and employees will be there  for you  when you need them most. It is the feeling of "we'r e in this  together," shared between customer and company, vot er and  candidate, boss and employee, that defines great le aders.   In contrast, relying on manipulations creates massi ve stress for  buyer and seller alike. For the buyer, it has becom e increasingly  difficult to know which product, service, brand or company is best. I  joke about the proliferation of toothpaste varietie s and the difficulty  of choosing the right one. But toothpaste is just a  metaphor. Nearly  every decision we're asked to make every single day  is like choosing  toothpaste. Deciding what law firm to hire, college  to attend, car to  buy, company to work for, candidate to elect—there are just too  many choices. All the advertising, promotions and p ressure  employed to tempt us one way or another, each attem pting to push  harder than the other to court us for our money or our support,  ultimately yields one consistent result: stress.   For the companies too, whose obligation it is to he lp us decide,  their ability to do so has gotten more and more dif ficult. Every day,  the competition is doing something new, something b etter. To con- stantly have to come up with a new promotion, a new  guerrilla  marketing tactic, a new feature to add, is hard wor k. Combined  with the long-term effects of years of short-term d ecisions that have  eroded profit margins, this raises stress levels in side organizations  as well. When manipulations are the norm, no one wi ns.   It's not an accident that doing business today, and  being in the  workforce today, is more stressful than it used to be. Peter Why-  brow, in his book  American Mania: When More Is Not Enough,  argues  that many of the ills that we suffer from today hav e very little to do  with the bad food we're eating or the partially hyd rogenated oils in  our diet. Rather, Whybrow says, it's the way that c orporate America  ======================================== [Página 42] ======================================== START WITH WHY  36 has developed that has increased our stress to leve ls so high we're  literally making ourselves sick because of it. Amer icans are  suffering ulcers, depression, high blood pressure, anxiety, and  cancer at record levels. According to Whybrow, all those promises  of more, more, more are actually overloading the re ward circuits of  our brain. The short-term gains that drive business  in America  today are actually destroying our health.   Just Because It Works Doesn't Make It Right   The danger of manipulations is that they work. And because ma- nipulations work, they have become the norm, practi ced by the vast  majority of companies and organizations, regardless  of size or  industry. That fact alone creates a systemic peer p ressure. With per- fect irony, we, the manipulators, have been manipul ated by our  own system. With every price drop, promotion, fear- based or aspi- rational message, and novelty we use to achieve our  goals, we find  our companies, our organizations and our systems ge tting weaker  and weaker.   The economic crisis that began in 2008 is just anot her, albeit  extreme, example of what can happen if a flawed ass umption is al- lowed to carry on for too long. The collapse of the  housing market  and the subsequent collapse of the banking industry  were due to  decisions made inside the banks based on a series o f manipulations.  Employees were manipulated with bonuses that encour aged short- sighted decision-making. Open shaming of anyone who  spoke out  discouraged responsible dissent. A free flow of loa ns encouraged  aspiring homebuyers to buy more than they could aff ord at all price  levels. There was very little loyalty. It was all a  series of  transactional decisions—effective, but at a high co st. Few were  working for the good of the whole. Why would they?— there was no  reason given to do so. There was no cause or belief  beyond instant  gratification. Bankers weren't the first to be swep t up by their own  ======================================== [Página 43] ======================================== CARROTS AND STICKS  37 success. American car manufacturers have conducted themselves  the same way for decades—manipulation after manipul ation, short- term decision built upon short-term decision. Buckl ing or even  collapse is the only logical conclusion when manipu lations are the  main course of action.   The reality is, in today's world, manipulations are  the norm.   But there is an alternative.    ======================================== [Página 44] ========================================   38  ======================================== [Página 45] ========================================   39   PART 2   AN ALTERNATIVE  PERSPECTIVE    ======================================== [Página 46] ========================================   40  ======================================== [Página 47] ========================================   41 3    THE GOLDEN CIRCLE       There are a few leaders who choose to inspire rathe r than manipu- late in order to motivate people. Whether individua ls or organiza- tions, every single one of these inspiring leaders thinks, acts and  communicates exactly the same way. And it's the com plete opposite  of the rest of us. Consciously or not, how they do it is by following a  naturally occurring pattern that I call The Golden Circle.   The concept of The Golden Circle was inspired by th e golden  ratio—a simple mathematical relationship that has f ascinated  mathematicians, biologists, architects, artists, mu sicians and  naturists since the beginning of history. From the Egyptians to  Pythagoras to Leonardo da Vinci, many have looked t o the golden  ratio to provide a mathematical formula for proport ion and even  beauty. It also supports the notion that there is m ore order in nature  ======================================== [Página 48] ======================================== START WITH WHY  42 than we think, as in the symmetry of leaves and the  geometric  perfection of snowflakes.  What I found so attractive about the golden ratio, however, was  that it had so many applications in so many fields.  And even more  significantly, it offered a formula that could prod uce repeat- able  and predictable results in places where such result s might have  been assumed to be a random occurrence or luck. Eve n Mother  Nature—for most people a symbol of unpredictability —exhibited  more order than we previously acknowledged. Like th e golden  ratio, which offers evidence of order in the seemin g disorder of  nature, The Golden Circle finds order and predictab ility in human  behavior. Put simply, it helps us understand why we  do what we  do. The Golden Circle provides compelling evidence of how much  more we can achieve if we remind ourselves to start  everything we  do by first asking why.   The Golden Circle is an alternative perspective to existing  assumptions about why some leaders and organization s have  achieved such a disproportionate degree of influenc e. It offers clear  insight as to how Apple is able to innovate in so m any diverse  industries and never lose its ability to do so. It explains why people  tattoo Harley-Davidson logos on their bodies. It pr ovides a clearer  understanding not just of how Southwest Airlines cr eated the most  profitable airline in history, but why the things i t did worked. It  even gives some clarity as to why people followed D r. Martin Lu- ther King Jr. in a movement that changed a nation a nd why we took  up John F. Kennedy's challenge to put a man on the moon even after  he died. The Golden Circle shows how these leaders were able to  inspire action instead of manipulating people to ac t.   This alternative perspective is not just useful for  changing the  world; there are practical applications for the abi lity to inspire, too.  It can be used as a guide to vastly improving leade rship, corporate  culture, hiring, product development, sales, and ma rketing. It even  ======================================== [Página 49] ======================================== THE GOLDEN CIRCLE  43 explains loyalty and how to create enough momentum to turn an  idea into a social movement.   And it all starts from the inside out. It all start s with Why.   Before we can explore its applications, let me firs t define the  terms, starting from the outside of the circle and moving inward.   WHAT: Every single company and organization on the planet  knows WHAT they do. This is true no matter how big or small, no  matter what industry. Everyone is easily able to de scribe the prod- ucts or services a company sells or the job functio n they have within  that system. WHATs are easy to identify.   HOW: Some companies and people know HOW they do WHA T  they do. Whether you call them a "differentiating v alue proposi- tion," "proprietary process" or "unique selling pro position," HOWs  are often given to explain how something is differe nt or better. Not  as obvious as WHATs, many think these are the diffe rentiating or  motivating factors in a decision. It would be false  to assume that's  all that is required. There is one missing detail:   WHY: Very few people or companies can clearly artic ulate WHY  they do WHAT they do. When I say WHY, I don't mean to make  money—that's a result. By WHY I mean what is your p urpose,  cause or belief? WHY does your company exist? WHY d o you get  out of bed every morning? And WHY should anyone car e?   When most organizations or people think, act or com municate  they do so from the outside in, from WHAT to WHY. A nd for good  reason—they go from clearest thing to the fuzziest thing. We say  WHAT we do, we sometimes say HOW we do it, but we r arely say  WHY we do WHAT we do.   But not the inspired companies. Not the inspired le aders. Every  single one of them, regardless of their size or the ir industry, thinks,  acts and communicates from the inside out.   I use Apple Inc. frequently as an example simply be cause they  have broad recognition and their products are easy to grasp and  ======================================== [Página 50] ======================================== START WITH WHY  44 compare to others. What's more, Apple's success ove r time is not  typical. Their ability to remain one of the most in novative  companies year after year, combined with their unca nny ability to  attract a cultlike following, makes them a great ex ample to  demonstrate many of the principles of The Golden Ci rcle.   I'll start with a simple marketing example.   If Apple were like most other companies, a marketin g message  from them would move from the outside in of The Gol den Circle. It  would start with some statement of WHAT the company  does or  makes, followed by HOW they think they are differen t or better  than the competition, followed by some call to acti on. With that, the  company would expect some behavior in return, in th is case a pur- chase. A marketing message from Apple, if they were  like everyone  else, might sound like this:   We make great computers.   They're beautifully designed, simple to use and use r-friendly.   Wanna buy one?   It's not a very compelling sales pitch, but that's how most  companies sell to us. This is the norm. First they start with WHAT  they do-—"Here's our new car." Then they tell us ho w they do it or  how they are better—"It's got leather seats, great gas mileage, and  great financing." And then they make a call to acti on and expect a  behavior.   You see this pattern in business-to-consumer market s as well as  business-to-business environments: "Here's our law firm. Our law- yers went to the best schools and we represent the biggest clients.  Hire us." This pattern is also alive and well in po litics—"Here's the  candidate, here are her views on taxes and immigrat ion. See how's  she's different? Vote for her." In every case, the communication is  organized in an attempt to convince someone of a di fference or  superior value.   ======================================== [Página 51] ======================================== THE GOLDEN CIRCLE  45 But that is not what the inspiring leaders and orga nizations do.  Every one of them, regardless of size or industry, thinks, acts and  communicates from the inside out.   Let's look at that Apple example again and rewrite the example  in the order Apple  actually  communicates. This time, the example  starts with WHY.   Everything we do, we believe in challenging the sta tus quo. We  believe in thinking differently.   The way we challenge the status quo is by making ou r products  beautifully designed, simple to use and user-friend ly.   And we happen to make great computers.   Wanna buy one?   It's a completely different message. It actually  feels  different from  the first one. We're much more eager to buy a compu ter from Apple  after reading the second version—and all I did was reverse the  order of the information. There's no trickery, no m anipulation, no  free stuff, no aspirational messages, no celebritie s.   Apple doesn't simply reverse the order of informati on, their  message starts with WHY, a purpose, cause or belief  that has noth- ing to do with WHAT they do. WHAT they do—the produ cts they  make, from computers to small electronics—no longer  serves as the  reason to buy, they serve as the tangible proof of their cause. The  design and user interface of Apple products, though  important, are  not enough in themselves to generate such astoundin g loyalty  among their customers. Those important elements hel p make the  cause tangible and rational. Others can hire top de signers and  brilliant engineers and make beautiful, easy-to-use  products and  copy the things Apple does, and they could even ste al away Apple  employees to do it, but the results would not be th e same. Simply  copying WHAT Apple does or HOW it does it won't wor k. There is  something more, something hard to describe and near  impossible to  ======================================== [Página 52] ======================================== START WITH WHY  46 copy that gives Apple such a disproportionate level  of influence in  the market. The example starts to prove that people  don't buy  WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it.   It's worth repeating: people don't buy WHAT you do,  they buy  WHY you do it.   Apple's ability to design such innovative products so consis- tently  and their ability to command such astounding loyalt y for their  products comes from more than simply WHAT they do. The  problem is, organizations use the tangible features  and benefits to  build a rational argument for why their company, pr oduct or idea is  better than another. Sometimes those comparisons ar e made  outright and sometimes analogies or metaphors are d rawn, but the  effect is the same. Companies try to sell us WHAT t hey do, but we  buy WHY they do it. This is what I mean when 1 say they com- municate from the outside in; they lead with WHAT a nd HOW.   When communicating from the inside out, however, th e WHY is  offered as the reason to buy and the WHATs serve as  the tangible  proof of that belief. The things we can point to ra tionalize or explain  the reasons we're drawn to one product, company or idea over  another.   WHAT companies do are external factors, but WHY the y do it is  something deeper. In practical terms, there is noth ing special about  Apple. It is just a company like any other. There i s no real difference  between Apple and any of its competitors—Dell, HP, Gateway,  Toshiba. Pick one, it doesn't matter. They are all corporate  structures. That's all a company is. It's a structu re. They all make  computers. They all have some systems that work and  some that  don't. They all have equal access to the same talen t, the same re- sources, the same agencies, the same consultants an d the same  media. They all have some good managers, some good designers  and smart engineers. They all make some products th at work well  and some that don't. . . even Apple. Why, then, doe s Apple have  ======================================== [Página 53] ======================================== THE GOLDEN CIRCLE  47 such a disproportionate level of success? Why are t hey more  innovative? Why are they consistently more profitab le? And how  did they manage to build such a cultish loyal follo wing—something  very few companies are ever able to achieve?   People don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do i t. This is  the reason Apple has earned a remarkable level of f lexibility. People  are obviously comfortable buying a computer from Ap ple. But  people are also perfectly comfortable buying an mp3  player from  them, or a cell phone or a DVR. Consumers and inves tors are  completely at ease with Apple offering so many diff erent products  in so many different categories. It's not WHAT Appl e does that  distinguishes them. It is WHY they do it. Their pro ducts give life to  their cause.   I'm not so foolhardy as to propose that their produ cts don't  matter; of course they do. But it's the reason they  matter that is  contrary to the conventional wisdom. Their products , unto them- selves, are not the reason Apple is perceived as su perior; their prod- ucts, WHAT Apple makes, serve as the tangible proof  of what they  believe. It is that clear correlation between WHAT they do and  WHY they do it that makes Apple stand out. This is the reason we  perceive Apple as being authentic. Everything they do works to  demonstrate their WHY, to challenge the status quo.  Regardless of  the products they make or industry in which they op erate, it is  always clear that Apple "thinks different."   When Apple first came out with the Macintosh, havin g an op- erating system based on a graphical user interface and not a com- plicated computer language challenged how computers  worked at  the time. What's more, where most technology compan ies saw their  biggest marketing opportunity among businesses, App le wanted to  give an individual sitting at home the same power a s any company.  Apple's WHY, to challenge the status quo and to emp ower the in- dividual, is a pattern in that it repeats in all th ey say and do. It  ======================================== [Página 54] ======================================== START WITH WHY  48 comes to life in their iPod and even more so in iTu nes, a service that  challenged the status quo of the music industry's d istribution model  and was better suited to how individuals consumed m usic.   The music industry was organized to sell albums, a model that  evolved during a time when listening to music was l argely an  activity we did at home. Sony changed that in 1979 with the intro- duction of the Walkman. But even the Walkman, and l ater the  Discman, was limited to the number of cassette tape s or CDs you  could carry in addition to the device. The developm ent of the mp3  music format changed all that. Digital compression allowed for a  very high quantity of songs to be stored on relativ ely inexpensive  and highly portable digital music devices. Our abil ity to walk out of  the house with only one easy-to-carry device transf ormed music  into something we largely listened to away from hom e. And the  mp3 not only changed where we listened to music, it  also trans- formed us from an album-collecting culture to a son g-collecting  culture. While the music industry was still busy tr ying to sell us  albums, a model that no longer suited consumer beha vior, Apple  introduced their iPod by offering us "1,000 songs i n your pocket."  With the iPod and iTunes, Apple did a much better j ob of com- municating the value of both the mp3 and the mp3 pl ayer relative to  how we lived our lives. Their advertising didn't of fer exhaustive  descriptions of product details; it wasn't about th em, it was about  us. And we understood WHY we wanted it.   Apple did not invent the mp3, nor did they invent t he technol- ogy that became the iPod, yet they are credited wit h transforming  the music industry with it. The multigigabyte porta ble hard drive  music player was actually invented by Creative Tech nology Ltd., a  Singapore-based technology company that rose to pro minence by  making the Sound Blaster audio technology that enab les home PCs  to have sound. In fact, Apple didn't introduce the iPod until twenty- two months after Creative's entry into the market. This detail alone  ======================================== [Página 55] ======================================== THE GOLDEN CIRCLE  49 calls into question the assumption of a first mover 's advantage.  Given their history in digital sound, Creative was more qualified  than Apple to introduce a digital music product. Th e problem was,  they advertised their product as a "5GB mp3 player. " It is exactly the  same message as Apple's "1,000 songs in your pocket ." The  difference is Creative told us WHAT their product w as and Apple  told us WHY we needed it.   Only later, once we decided we had to have an iPod,  did the  WHAT matter—and we chose the 5GB version, 10GB vers ion, and  so on, the tangible details that proved we could ge t the 1,000 songs  in our pocket. Our decision started with WHY, and s o did Apple's  offering.   How many of us can say with certainty that, indeed,  an iPod is  actually better than Creative's Zen? iPods, for exa mple, are still  plagued with battery life and battery replacement i ssues. They tend  to just die. Maybe a Zen is better. The reality is,  we don't even care if  it is. People don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY y ou do it.  And it is Apple's clarity of WHY that gives them su ch a remarkable  ability to innovate, often competing against compan ies seemingly  more qualified than they, and succeed in industries  outside their  core business.   The same cannot be said for companies with a  fuz2y  sense of  WHY. When an organization defines itself by WHAT it  does, that's  all it will ever be able to do. Apple's competitors , having defined  themselves by their products or services, regardles s of their "differ- entiating value proposition," are not afforded the same freedom.  Gateway, for example, started selling flat-screen T Vs in 2003.  Having made flat-screen monitors for years, they we re every bit as  qualified to make and sell TVs. But the company fai led to make a  credible name for itself among consumer electronics  brands and  gave up the business two years later to focus on it s "core business."  Dell came out with PDAs in 2002 and mp3 players in 2003, but  ======================================== [Página 56] ======================================== START WITH WHY  50 lasted only a few years in each market. Dell makes good-quality  products and is fully qualified to produce these ot her technologies.  The problem was they had defined themselves by WHAT  they did;  they made computers, and it simply didn't make sens e to us to buy  a PDA or mp3 player from them. It didn't feel right . How many  people do you think would stand on line for six hou rs to buy a new  cell phone from Dell, as they did for the release o f Apple's iPhone?  People couldn't see Dell as anything more than a co mputer  company. It just didn't make sense. Poor sales quic kly ended Dell's  desire to enter the small electronic goods market; instead they opted  to "focus on their core business." Unless Dell, lik e so many others,  can rediscover their founding purpose, cause or bel ief and start with  WHY in all they say and do, all they will ever do i s sell computers.  They will be stuck in their "core business."   Apple, unlike its competitors, has defined itself b y WHY it does  things, not WHAT it does. It is not a computer comp any, but a  company that challenges the status quo and offers i ndividuals sim- pler alternatives. Apple even changed its legal nam e in 2007 from  Apple Computer, Inc. to Apple Inc. to reflect the f act that they were  more than just a computer company. Practically spea king, it doesn't  really matter what a company's legal name is. For A pple, however,  having the word "Computer" in their name didn't lim it WHAT they  could do. It limited how they thought of themselves . The change  wasn't practical, it was philosophical.   Apple's WHY was formed at its founding in the late 1970s and  hasn't changed to this date. Regardless of the prod ucts they make or  the industries into which they migrate, their WHY s till remains a  constant. And Apple's intention to challenge accept ed thinking has  proved prophetic. As a computer company they redire cted the  course of the personal computing industry. As a sma ll electronics  company they have challenged the traditional domina nce of com- panies like Sony and Philips. As a purveyor of mobi le phones they  ======================================== [Página 57] ======================================== THE GOLDEN CIRCLE  51 pushed the old hands—Motorola, Ericsson, and Nokia— to reex- amine their own businesses. Apple's ability to ente r and even dom- inate so many different industries has even challen ged what it  means to be a computer company in the first place. Regardless of  WHAT it does, we know WHY Apple exists.   The same cannot be said for their competitors. Alth ough they all  had a clear sense of WHY at some point—it was one o f the primary  factors that helped each of them become billion-dol lar companies— over the course of time, all of Apple's competitors  lost their WHY.  Now all those companies define themselves by WHAT t hey do: we  make computers. They turned from companies with a c ause into  companies that sold products. And when that happens , price,  quality, service and features become the primary cu rrency to  motivate a purchase decision. At that point a compa ny and its  products have ostensibly become commodities. As any  company  forced to compete on price, quality, service or fea tures alone can  attest, it is very hard to differentiate for any pe riod of time or build  loyalty on those factors alone. Plus it costs money  and is stressful  waking up every day trying to compete on that level  alone. Know- ing WHY is essential for lasting success and the ab ility to avoid  being lumped in with others.   Any company faced with the challenge of how to diff erentiate  themselves in their market is basically a commodity , regardless of  WHAT they do or HOW they do it. Ask a milk producer , for ex- ample, and they will tell you that there are actual ly variations  among milk brands. The problem is you have to be an  expert to  understand the differences. To the outside world, a ll milk is basi- cally the same, so we just lump all the brands toge ther and call it a  commodity. In response, that's how the industry act s. This is largely  the pattern for almost every other product or servi ce on the market  today, business-to-consumer or business-to-business . They focus on  WHAT they do and HOW they do it without considerati on of WHY;  ======================================== [Página 58] ======================================== START WITH WHY  52 we lump them together and they act like commodities . The more we  treat them like commodities, the more they focus on  WHAT and  HOW they do it. It's a vicious cycle. But only comp anies that act like  commodities are the ones who wake up every day with  the  challenge of how to differentiate. Companies and or ganizations  with a clear sense of WHY never worry about it. The y don't think of  themselves as being like anyone else and they don't  have to  "convince" anyone of their value. They don't need c omplex systems  of carrots and sticks. They  are  different, and everyone knows it.  They start with WHY in everything they say and do.   There are those who still believe that Apple's diff erence comes  from its marketing ability. Apple "sells a lifestyl e," marketing pro- fessionals will tell you. Then how come these marke ting profes- sionals haven't intentionally repeated Apple's succ ess and longevity  for another company? Calling it a "lifestyle" is a recognition that  people who live a certain way choose to incorporate  Apple into their  lives. Apple didn't invent the lifestyle, nor does it sell a lifestyle.  Apple is simply one of the brands that those who li ve a certain  lifestyle are drawn to. Those people use certain pr oducts or brands  in the course of living in that lifestyle; that is,  in part, how we  recognize their way of life in the first place. The  products they  choose become proof of WHY they do the things they do. It is only  because Apple's WHY is so clear that those who beli eve what they  believe are drawn to them. As Harley-Davidson fits into the lifestyle  of a certain group of people and Prada shoes fit th e lifestyle of  another group, it is the lifestyle that came first.  Like the products the  company produces that serve as proof of the company 's WHY, so  too does a brand or product serve as proof of an in dividual's WHY.   Others, even some who work for Apple, will say that  what truly  distinguishes Apple is in fact the quality of their  products alone.  Having good-quality products is of course important . No matter  how clear your WHY, if WHAT you sell doesn't work, the whole  ======================================== [Página 59] ======================================== THE GOLDEN CIRCLE  53 thing falls flat. But a company doesn't need to hav e the best  products, they just need to be good or very good. B etter or best is a  relative comparison. Without first understanding WH Y, the com- parison itself is of no value to the decision maker .   The concept of "better" begs the question: based on  what standard?  Is a Ferrari F430 sports car better than a Honda Od yssey minivan? It  depends why you need the car. If you have a family of six, a two- seater Ferrari is not better. However, if you're lo oking for a great  way to meet women, a Honda minivan is probably not better (de- pending on what kind of woman you're looking to mee t, I guess; I  too shouldn't make assumptions). Why the product ex ists must first  be considered and why someone wants it must match. I could tell  you about all the engineering marvels of the Honda Odyssey, some  of which may actually be better than a Ferrari. It certainly gets  better gas mileage. The odds are that I'm not going  to convince  someone who really wants that sports car to buy any thing else. That  some people are viscerally drawn to a Ferrari more than a Honda  Odyssey says more about the person than the enginee ring of the  product. The engineering, for example, would simply  be one of the  tangible points that a Ferrari lover could point ou t to prove how he  feels about the car. The dogged defense of the supe riority of the  Ferrari from the person whose personality is predis posed to favor  all the features and benefits of a Ferrari cannot b e an objective  conversation. Why do you think most people who buy Ferraris are  willing to pay a premium to get it in red whereas m ost who buy  Honda Odysseys probably don't care much about the c olor at all?   For all those who will try to convince you that App le computers  are just better, I cannot dispute a single claim. A ll I can offer is that  most of the factors that they believe make them bet ter meet their  standard of what a computer should do. With that in  mind, Macin- toshes are, in practice, only better for those who believe what Apple  believes. Those people who share Apple's WHY believ e that Apple's  ======================================== [Página 60] ======================================== START WITH WHY  54 products are objectively better, and any attempt to  convince them  otherwise is pointless. Even with objective metrics  in hand, the  argument about which is better or which is worse wi thout first  establishing a common standard creates nothing more  than debate.  Loyalists for each brand will point to various feat ures and benefits  that matter to them (or don't matter to them) in an  attempt to  convince the other that they are right. And that's one of the primary  reasons why so many companies feel the need to diff erentiate in the  first place—based on the flawed assumption that onl y one group  can be right. But what if both parties were right? What if an Apple  was right for some people and a PC was right for ot hers? It's not a  debate about better or worse anymore, it's a discus sion about  different needs. And before the discussion can even  happen, the  WHYs for each must be established first.   A simple claim of better, even with the rational ev idence to back  it up, can create desire and even motivate a decisi on to buy, but it  doesn't create loyalty. If a customer feels inspire d to buy a product,  rather than manipulated, they will be able to verba lize the reasons  why they think what they bought is better. Good qua lity and fea- tures matter, but they are not enough to produce th e dogged loyalty  that all the most inspiring leaders and companies a re able to com- mand. It is the cause that is represented by the co mpany, brand,  product or person that inspires loyalty.     Not the Only Way, Just One Way   Knowing your WHY is not the only way to be successf ul, but it is  the only way to maintain a lasting success and have  a greater blend  of innovation and flexibility. When a WHY goes fuzz y, it becomes  much more difficult to maintain the growth, loyalty  and inspiration  that helped drive the original success. By difficul t, I mean that  manipulation rather than inspiration fast becomes t he strategy of  ======================================== [Página 61] ======================================== THE GOLDEN CIRCLE  55 choice to motivate behavior. This is effective in t he short term but  comes at a high cost in the long term.   Consider the classic business school case of the ra ilroads. In the  late 1800s, the railroads were the biggest companie s in the country.  Having achieved such monumental success, even chang ing the  landscape of America, remembering WHY stopped being  important  to them. Instead they became obsessed with WHAT the y did— they  were in the railroad business. This narrowing of pe rspective  influenced their decision-making—they invested all their money in  tracks and crossties and engines. But at the beginn ing of the  twentieth century, a new technology was introduced:  the airplane.  And all those big railroad companies eventually wen t out of busi- ness. What if they had defined themselves as being in the mass  transportation business? Perhaps their behavior wou ld have been  different. Perhaps they would have seen opportuniti es that they  otherwise missed. Perhaps they would own all the ai rlines today.   The comparison raises the question of the long-term  survivability  of so many other companies that have defined themse lves and their  industries by WHAT they do. They have been doing it  the same way  for so long that their ability to compete against a  new technology or  see a new perspective becomes a daunting task. The story of the  railroads has eerie similarities to the case of the  music industry  discussed earlier. This is another industry that ha s not done a good  job of adjusting its business model to fit a behavi oral change  prompted by a new technology. But other industries whose business  models evolved in a different time show similar cra cks— the  newspaper, publishing and television industries, to  name but three.  These are the current-day railroads that are strugg ling to define  their value while watching their customers turn to companies from  other industries to serve their needs. Perhaps if m usic companies  had a clearer sense of WHY, they would have seen th e opportunity  ======================================== [Página 62] ======================================== START WITH WHY  56 to invent the equivalent of iTunes instead of leavi ng it to a scrappy  computer company.   In all cases, going back to the original purpose, c ause or belief  will help these industries adapt. Instead of asking , "WHAT should  we do to compete?" the questions must be asked, "WH Y did we start  doing WHAT we're doing in the first place, and WHAT  can we do  to bring our cause to life considering all the tech nologies and market  opportunities available today?" But don't take my w ord for it. None  of this is my opinion. It is all firmly grounded in  the tenets of  biology.    ======================================== [Página 63] ========================================   57 4    THIS IS NOT OPINION, THIS IS BIOLOGY   Now, the Star-Belly Sneetches had bellies with star s.  The Plain-Belly Sneetches had none upon thars. Thos e  stars weren't so big. They were really so small. Yo u  might think such a thing wouldn't matter at all.     Then, quickly, Sylvester McMonkey McBean   Put together a very peculiar machine.   And he said, "You want stars like a Star-Belly Snee tch?   My friends, you can have them for three dollars eac h!"     ======================================== [Página 64] ======================================== START WITH WHY  58 In his 1961 story about the Sneetches, Dr. Seuss in troduced us to  two groups of Sneetches, one with stars on their be llies and the  other with none. The ones without stars wanted desp erately to get  stars so they could feel like they fit in. They wer e willing to go to  extreme lengths and pay larger and larger sums of m oney simply to  feel like they were part of a group. But only Sylve ster McMonkey  McBean, the man whose machine puts "stars upon thar s," profited  from the Sneetches' desire to fit in.   As with so many things, Dr. Seuss explained it best . The  Sneetches perfectly capture a very basic human need —the need to  belong. Our need to belong is not rational, but it is a constant that  exists across all people in all cultures. It is a f eeling we get when  those around us share our values and beliefs. When we feel like we  belong we feel connected and we feel safe. As human s we crave the  feeling and we seek it out.   Sometimes our feeling of belonging is incidental. W e're not  friends with everyone from our hometown, but travel  across the  state, and you may meet someone from your hometown and you  instantly have a connection with them. We're not fr iends with ev- eryone from our home state, but travel across the c ountry, and  you'll feel a special bond with someone you meet wh o is from your  home state. Go abroad and you'll form instant bonds  with other  Americans you meet. I remember a trip I took to Aus tralia. One day  I was on a bus and heard an American accent. I turn ed and struck  up a conversation. I immediately felt connected to them, we could  speak the same language, understand the same slang.  As a stranger  in a strange city, for that brief moment, I felt li ke I belonged, and  because of it, I trusted those strangers on the bus  more than any  other passengers. In fact, we spent time together l ater. No matter  where we go, we trust those with whom we are able t o perceive  common values or beliefs.   ======================================== [Página 65] ======================================== THIS IS NOT OPINION, THIS IS BIOLOGY  59 Our desire to feel like we belong is so powerful th at we will go to  great lengths, do irrational things and often spend  money to get that  feeling. Like the Sneetches, we want to be around p eople and  organizations who are like us and share our beliefs . When  companies talk about WHAT they do and how advanced their  products are, they may have appeal, but they do not  necessarily  represent something to which we want to belong. But  when a  company clearly communicates their WHY, what they b elieve, and  we believe what they believe, then we will sometime s go to  extraordinary lengths to include those products or brands in our  lives. This is not because they are better, but bec ause they become  markers or symbols of the values and beliefs we hol d dear. Those  products and brands make us feel like we belong and  we feel a  kinship with others who buy the same things. Fan cl ubs, started by  customers, are often formed without any help from t he company  itself. These people form communities, in person or  online, not just  to share their love of a product with others, but t o be in the  company of people like them. Their decisions have n othing to do  with the company or its products; they have everyth ing to do with  the individuals themselves.   Our natural need to belong also makes us good at sp otting  things that don't belong. It's a sense we get. A fe eling. Something  deep inside us, something we can't put into words, allows us to feel  how some things just fit and some things just don't . Dell selling mp3  players just doesn't feel right because Dell define s itself as a  computer company, so the only things that belong ar e computers.  Apple defines itself as a company on a mission and so anything  they do that fits that definition feels like it bel ongs. In 2004, they  produced a promotional iPod in partnership with the  iconoclastic  Irish rock band U2. That makes sense. They would ne ver have  produced a promotional iPod with Celine Dion, even though she's  sold vastly more records than U2 and may have a big ger audience.  ======================================== [Página 66] ======================================== START WITH WHY  60 U2 and Apple belong together because they share the  same values  and beliefs. They both push boundaries. It would no t have made  sense if Apple released a special iPod with Celine Dion. As big as  her audience may be, the partnership just doesn't a lign.   Look no farther than Apple's TV commercials "I'm a Mac and I'm  a PC" for a perfect representation of who a Mac use r needs to be to  feel like they belong. In the commercial, the Mac u ser is a young  guy, always in jeans and a T-shirt, always relaxed and always  having a sense of humor poking fun at "the system."  The PC, as  defined by Apple, is in a suit. Older. Stodgy. To f it in with Mac, you  have to be like Mac. Microsoft responded to Apple w ith its own "I'm  a PC" campaign, which depicts people from all walks  of life  identifying themselves as "PC." Microsoft included many more  people in their ads—teachers, scientists, musicians  and children. As  one would expect from the company that supplies 95 percent of the  computer operating systems, to belong to that crowd , you have to  be everyone else. One is not better or worse; it de pends on where  you feel like you belong. Are you a rabble-rouser o r are you with  the majority?   We are drawn to leaders and organizations that are good at  communicating what they believe. Their ability to m ake us feel like  we belong, to make us feel special, safe and not al one is part of what  gives them the ability to inspire us. Those whom we  consider great  leaders all have an ability to draw us close and to  command our  loyalty. And we feel a strong bond with those who a re also drawn  to the same leaders and organizations. Apple users feel a bond with  each other. Harley riders are bonded to each other.  Anyone who  was drawn to hear Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. give h is "I Have a  Dream" speech, regardless of race, religion or sex,  stood together in  that crowd as brothers and sisters, bonded by their  shared values  and beliefs. They knew they belonged together becau se they could  feel it in their gut.   ======================================== [Página 67] ======================================== THIS IS NOT OPINION, THIS IS BIOLOGY  61 Gut Decisions Don't Happen in Your Stomach   The principles of The Golden Circle are much more t han a com- munications hierarchy. Its principles are deeply gr ounded in the  evolution of human behavior. The power of WHY is no t opinion, it's  biology. If you look at a cross section of the huma n brain, from the  top down, you see that the levels of The Golden Cir cle correspond  precisely with the three major levels of the brain.   The newest area of the brain, our  Homo sapien  brain, is the      neocortex, which corresponds with the WHAT level. T he neocortex  is responsible for rational and analytical thought and language.   The middle two sections comprise the limbic brain. The limbic  brain is responsible for all of our feelings, such as trust and loyalty.  It is also responsible for all human behavior and a ll our decision- making, but it has no capacity for language.   When we communicate from the outside in, when we co mmu- nicate WHAT we do first, yes, people can understand  vast amounts  of complicated information, like facts and features , but it does not  drive behavior. But when we communicate from the in side out,  we're talking directly to the part of the brain tha t controls decision-   ======================================== [Página 68] ======================================== START WITH WHY  62 making, and our language part of the brain allows u s to rationalize  those decisions.   The part of the brain that controls our feelings ha s no capacity for  language. It is this disconnection that makes putti ng our feelings  into words so hard. We have trouble, for example, e xplaining why  we married the person we married. We struggle to pu t into words  the real reasons why we love them, so we talk aroun d it or  rationalize it. "She's funny, she's smart," we star t. But there are lots  of funny and smart people in the world, but we don' t love them and  we don't want to marry them. There is obviously mor e to falling in  love than just personality and competence. Rational ly, we know our  explanation isn't the real reason. It is how our lo ved ones make us  feel, but those feelings are really hard to put int o words. So when  pushed, we start to talk around it. We may even say  things that  don't make any rational sense. "She completes me," we might say,  for example. What does that mean and how do you loo k for  someone who does that so you can marry them? That's  the problem  with love; we only know when we've found it because  it "just feels  right."   The same is true for other decisions. When a decisi on feels right,  we have a hard time explaining why we did what we d id. Again,  the part of the brain that controls decision-making  doesn't control  language, so we rationalize. This complicates the v alue of polls or  market research. Asking people why they chose you o ver another  may provide wonderful evidence of how they have rat ionalized the  decision, but it does not shed much light on the tr ue motivation for  the decision. It's not that people don't know, it's  that they have  trouble explaining why they do what they do. Decisi on-making and  the ability to explain those decisions exist in dif ferent parts of the  brain.   This is where "gut decisions" come from. They just feel right.  There is no part of the stomach that controls decis ion-making, it all  ======================================== [Página 69] ======================================== THIS IS NOT OPINION, THIS IS BIOLOGY  63 happens in the limbic brain. It's not an accident t hat we use that  word "feel" to explain those decisions either. The reason gut deci- sions feel right is because the part of the brain t hat controls them  also controls our feelings. Whether you defer to yo ur gut or you're  simply following your heart, no matter which part o f the body you  think is driving the decision, the reality is it's all in your limbic  brain.   Our limbic brain is powerful, powerful enough to dr ive behavior  that sometimes contradicts our rational and analyti cal under- standing of a situation. We often trust our gut eve n if the decision  flies in the face of all the facts and figures. Ric hard Restak, a well-  known neuroscientist, talks about this in his book  The Naked Brain.  When you force people to make decisions with only t he rational  part of their brain, they almost invariably end up "overthinking."  These rational decisions tend to take longer to mak e, says Restak,  and can often be of lower quality. In contrast, dec isions made with  the limbic brain , gut decisions, tend to be faster, higher-quality  de cisions. This is one of  the primary reasons why teachers tell stu- dents to go with  their first instinct when taking a multiple-choice  test, to  trust their gut. The more time spent thinking abou t the  answer, the  bigger the risk that it may be the wrong one. Our  limbic brains are smart and often know the right th ing to do. It is  our inability to verbalize the reasons that may cau se us to doubt  ourselves or trust the empirical evidence when our gut tells us not  to.   Consider the experience of buying a flat-screen TV at your local  electronics store. You stand in the aisle listening  to an expert explain  to you the difference between LCD and plasma. The s ales rep gives  you all the rational differences and benefits, yet you are still none  the wiser as to which one is best for you. After an  hour, you still  have no clue. Your mind is on overload because you' re over-  thinking the decision. You eventually make a choice  and walk out of  ======================================== [Página 70] ======================================== START WITH WHY  64 the store, still not 100 percent convinced you chos e the right one.  Then you go to your friend's house and see that he bought the  "other one." He goes on and on about how much he lo ves his TV.  Suddenly you're jealous, even though you still don' t know that his  is any better than yours. You wonder, "Did I buy th e wrong one?"   Companies that fail to communicate a sense of WHY f orce us to  make decisions with only empirical evidence. This i s why those de- cisions take more time, feel difficult or leave us uncertain. Under  these conditions manipulative strategies that explo it our desires,  fears, doubts or fantasies work very well. We're fo rced to make  these less-than-inspiring decisions for one simple reason— companies don't offer us anything else besides the facts and figures,  features and benefits upon which to base our decisi ons. Companies  don't tell us WHY.   People don't buy WHAT you do; they buy WHY you do i t. A  failure to communicate WHY creates nothing but stre ss or doubt. In  contrast, many people who are drawn to buy Macintos h computers  or Harley-Davidson motorcycles, for example, don't need to talk to  anyone about which brand to choose. They feel the u tmost  confidence in their decision and the only question they ask is which  Mac or which Harley. At that level, the rational fe atures and bene- fits, facts and figures absolutely matter, but not to drive the decision  to give money or loyalty to the company or brand. T hat decision is  already made. The tangible features are simply to h elp direct the  choice of product that best fits our needs. In thes e cases, the deci- sions happened in the perfect inside-out order. Tho se decisions  started with WHY—the emotional component of the dec ision— and  then the rational components allowed the buyer to v erbalize or  rationalize the reasons for their decision.   This is what we mean when we talk about winning hea rts and  minds. The heart represents the limbic, feeling par t of the brain, and  the mind is the rational, language center. Most com panies are quite  ======================================== [Página 71] ======================================== THIS IS NOT OPINION, THIS IS BIOLOGY  65 adept at winning minds; all that requires is a comp arison of all the  features and benefits. Winning hearts, however, tak es more work.  Given the evidence of the natural order of decision -making, I can't  help but wonder if the order of the expression "hea rts and minds" is  a coincidence. Why does no one set out to win "mind s and hearts"?   The ability to win hearts before minds is not easy.  It's a delicate  balance of art and science—another coincidental gra mmatical  construction. Why is it that things are not a balan ce of science and  art, but always art before science? Perhaps it is a  subtle clue our  language-impaired limbic brain is sending us to hel p us see that the  art of leading is about following your heart. Perha ps our brains are  trying to tell us that WHY must come first.   Absent a WHY, a decision is harder to make. And whe n in doubt  we look to science, to data, to guide decisions. Co mpanies will tell  you that the reason they start with WHAT they do or  HOW they do  it is because that's what their customers asked for . Quality. Service.  Price. Features. That's what the data reported. But  for the fact that  the part of the brain that controls decision-making  is different from  the part of the brain that is able to report back t hat decision, it  would be a perfectly valid conclusion to give peopl e what they ask  for. Unfortunately, there is more evidence that sal es don't sig- nificantly increase and bonds of loyalty are not fo rmed simply when  companies say or do everything their customers want . Henry Ford  summed it up best. "If I had asked people what they  wanted," he  said, "they would have said a faster horse."   This is the genius of great leadership. Great leade rs and great  organizations are good at seeing what most of us ca n't see. They are  good at giving us things we would never think of as king for. When  the computer revolution was afoot, computer users c ouldn't ask for  a graphical user interface. But that's what Apple g ave us. In the face  of expanding competition in the airline industry, m ost air travelers  would never have thought to ask for less instead of  more. But that's  ======================================== [Página 72] ======================================== START WITH WHY  66 what Southwest did. And in the face of hard times a nd  overwhelming odds, few would have asked their count ry, what can  I do for you over what can you do for me? The very cause upon  which John F. Kennedy introduced his presidency. Gr eat leaders are  those who trust their gut. They are those who under stand the art  before the science. They win hearts before minds. T hey are the ones  who start with WHY.   We make decisions all day long, and many of them ar e emotion- ally driven. Rarely do we sift through all the avai lable information  to ensure we know every fact. And we don't need to.  It is all about  degrees of certainty. "I can make a decision with 3 0 percent of the  information," said former secretary of state Colin Powell. "Anything  more than 80 percent is too much." There is always a level at which  we trust ourselves or those around us to guide us, and don't always  feel we need all the facts and figures. And sometimes w e just may  not trust ourselves to make a certain decision yet.  This may explain  why we feel  (there's that word again) so uncomfortable when ot hers  twist our arm to make a decision that doesn't sit w ell in our gut. We  trust our gut to help us decide whom to vote for or  which shampoo  to buy. Because our biology complicates our ability  to verbalize the  real reasons why we make the decisions we do, we ra tionalize based  on more tangible factors, like the design or the se rvice or the brand.  This is the basis for the false assumption that pri ce or features mat-  ter more than they do. Those things matter, they pr ovide us the  tangible things we can point to to rationalize our decision-making,  but they don't set the course and they don't inspir e behavior.   It's What You Can't See That Matters   "Gets your whites whiter and your brights brighter, " said the TV  commercial for the newest laundry detergent. This w as the value  proposition for so many years in the laundry deterg ent business. A  perfectly legitimate claim. That's what the market research revealed  ======================================== [Página 73] ======================================== THIS IS NOT OPINION, THIS IS BIOLOGY  67 customers wanted. The data was true, but the truth of what people  wanted was different.   The makers of laundry detergent asked consumers WHA T they  wanted from detergent, and consumers said whiter wh ites and  brighter brights. Not such a remarkable finding, if  you think about  it, that people doing laundry wanted their detergen t to help get their  clothes not just clean, but very clean. So brands a ttempted to dif- ferentiate HOW they got your whites whiter and brig hts brighter by  trying to convince consumers that one additive was more effective  than another. Protein, said one brand. Color enhanc ers, said another.  No one asked customers WHY they wanted their clothe s clean. That  little nugget wasn't revealed until many years late r when a group of  anthropologists hired by one of the packaged-goods companies  revealed that all those additives weren't in fact d riving behavior.  They observed that when people took their washing o ut of the  dryer, no one held it up to the light to see how wh ite it was or  compared it to newer items to see how bright it was . The first thing  people did when they pulled their laundry out of th e dryer was to  smell it. This was an amazing discovery.  Feeling  clean was more im- portant to people than being clean. There was a pre sumption that all  detergents get your clothes clean. That's what dete rgent is supposed  to do. But having their clothes smell fresh and cle an mattered much  more than the nuanced differences between which det ergent  actually made clothes measurably cleaner.   That a false assumption swayed an entire industry t o follow the  wrong direction is not unique to detergents. Cell p hone companies  believed people wanted more options and buttons unt il Apple in- troduced its iPhone with fewer options and only one  button. The  German automakers believed their engineering alone mattered to  American car buyers. They were stunned and perplexe d when they  learned that great engineering wasn't enough. One b y one, the  German luxury car makers begrudgingly added cup hol ders to their  ======================================== [Página 74] ======================================== START WITH WHY  68 fine automobiles. It was a feature that mattered a great deal to  commuter-minded Americans, but was rarely mentioned  in any  research about what factors influenced purchase dec isions. I am not,  for a moment, proposing that cup holders make peopl e loyal to  BMWs. All I am proposing is that even for rationall y minded car  buyers, there is more to decision-making than meets  the eye.  Literally.   The power of the limbic brain is astounding. It not  only controls  our gut decisions, but it can influence us to do th ings that seem  illogical or irrational. Leaving the safety of home  to explore faraway  places. Crossing oceans to see what's on the other side. Leaving a  stable job to start a business out of your basement  with no money in  the bank. Many of us look at these decisions and sa y, "That's stupid,  you're crazy. You could lose everything. You could get yourself  killed. What are you thinking?" It is not logic or facts but our hopes  and dreams, our hearts and our guts, that drive us to try new things.   If we were all rational, there would be no small bu sinesses, there  would be no exploration, there would be very little  innovation and  there would be no great leaders to inspire all thos e things. It is the  undying belief in something bigger and better that drives that kind  of behavior. But it can also control behavior born out of other  emotions, like hate or fear. Why else would someone  plot to hurt  someone they had never met?   The amount of market research that reveals that peo ple want to  do business with the company that offers them the b est-quality  products, with the most features, the best service and all at a good  price is astounding. But consider the companies wit h the greatest  loyalty—they rarely have all those things. If you w anted to buy a  custom Harley-Davidson, you used to wait six months  for delivery  (to give them credit, they've got it down from a ye ar). That's bad  service! Apple's computers are at least 25 percent more expensive  than a comparable PC. There is less software availa ble for their  ======================================== [Página 75] ======================================== THIS IS NOT OPINION, THIS IS BIOLOGY  69 operating system. They have fewer peripherals. The machines them- selves are sometimes slower than a comparable PC. I f people made  only rational decisions, and did all the research b efore making a  purchase, no one would ever buy a Mac. But of cours e people do  buy Macs. And some don't just buy them—they love th em, a feeling  that comes straight from the heart. Or the limbic b rain.   We all know someone who is a die-hard Mac lover. As k them  WHY they love their Mac. They won't tell you, "Well , I see myself as  someone who likes to challenge the status quo, and it's important  for me to surround myself with the people, products  and brands  that prove to the outside world who I believe I am. " Biologically,  that's what happened. But that decision was made in  the part of the  brain that controls behavior but not language. So t hey will provide a  rationalization: "It's the user interface. It's the  simplicity. It's the  design. It's the high quality. They're the best com puters. I'm a  creative person." In reality, their purchase decisi on and their loyalty  are deeply personal. They don't really care about A pple; it's all  about them.   The same can even be said for the people who love t o work at  Apple. Even employees can't put it into words. In t heir case, their  job is one of the WHATs to their WHY. They too are convinced it's  the quality of the products alone that is behind Ap ple's success. But  deep inside, they all love being a part of somethin g bigger than  themselves. The most loyal Apple employees, like th e most loyal  Apple customers, all love a good revolution. A grea t raise and  added benefits couldn't convince a loyal Apple empl oyee to work  for Dell, and no amount of cash-back incentives and  rebates could  convince a loyal Mac user to switch to a PC (many a re already  paying double the price). This is beyond rational. This is a belief. It's  no accident that the culture at Apple is often desc ribed as a cult. It's  more than just products, it's a cause to support. I t's a matter of faith.   ======================================== [Página 76] ======================================== START WITH WHY  70 Remember the Honda and the Ferrari? Products are no t just  symbols of what the company believes, they also ser ve as symbols  of what the loyal buyers believe. People with Apple  laptop com- puters, for example, love opening them up while sit ting in an air- port. They like that everyone knows they are using a Mac. It's an  emblem, a symbol of who they are. That glowing Appl e logo speaks  to something about them and how they see the world.  Does anyone  notice when someone pops open the lid of their HP o r Dell  computer? No! Not even the people using the compute rs care. HP  and Dell have a fuzzy sense of WHY, so their produc ts and their  brands don't symbolize anything about the users. To  the Dell or HP  user, their computer, no matter how fast or sleek, is not a symbol of  a higher purpose, cause or belief. It's just a comp uter. In fact, for the  longest time, the logo on the lid of a Dell compute r faced the user so  when they opened it, it would be upside down for ev eryone else.   Products with a clear sense of WHY give people a wa y to tell the  outside world who they are and what they believe. R emember,  people don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do i t. If a  company does not have a clear sense of WHY then it is impossible  for the outside world to perceive anything more tha n WHAT the  company does. And when that happens, manipulations that rely on  pushing price, features, service or quality become the primary cur- rency of differentiation.    ======================================== [Página 77] ========================================   71 5    CLARITY, DISCIPLINE AND CONSISTENCY            Nature abhors a vacuum.

The existence of a food chain in any ec osystem, in which  each animal exists as food for another, is a way of  maintaining  balance. The Golden Circle, grounded in natural pri nciples of  biology, obeys the need for balance as well. As I'v e discussed, when  the WHY is absent, imbalance is produced and manipu lations  thrive. And when manipulations thrive, uncertainty increases for  buyers, instability increases for sellers and stres s increases for all.   Starting with WHY is just the beginning. There is s till work to be  done before a person or an organization earns the r ight or ability to  inspire. For The Golden Circle to work, each of the  pieces must be in  balance and in the right order.   Clarity of WHY   It all starts with clarity. You have to know WHY yo u do WHAT you  do. If people don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY y ou do it, so  it follows that if you don't know WHY you do WHAT y ou do, how  will anyone else? If the leader of the organization  can't clearly ar- ticulate WHY the organization exists in terms beyon d its products  or services, then how does he expect the employees to know WHY  to come to work? If a politician can't articulate W HY she seeks  ======================================== [Página 78] ======================================== START WITH WHY  72 public office beyond the standard "to serve the peo ple" (the mini- mum rational standard for all politicians), then ho w will the voters  know whom to follow? Manipulations can motivate the  outcome of  an election, but they don't help choose who should lead. To lead  requires those who willingly follow. It requires th ose who believe in  something bigger than a single issue. To inspire st arts with the  clarity of WHY.   Discipline of HOW   Once you know WHY you do what you do, the question is HOW  will you do it? HOWs are your values or principles that guide HOW  to bring your cause to life. HOW we do things manif ests in the  systems and processes within an organization and th e culture. Un- derstanding HOW you do things and, more importantly , having the  discipline to hold the organization and all its emp loyees accountable  to those guiding principles enhances an organizatio n's ability to  work to its natural strengths. Understanding HOW gi ves greater  ability, for example, to hire people or find partne rs who will  naturally thrive when working with you.   Ironically, the most important question with the mo st elusive  answer—WHY do you do what you do?—is actually quite  simple  and efficient to discover (and I'll share it in lat er chapters). It's the  discipline to never veer from your cause, to hold y ourself  accountable to HOW you do things; that's the hardes t part. Making  it even more difficult for ourselves, we remind our selves of our  values by writing them on the wall... as nouns. Int egrity. Honesty.  Innovation. Communication, for example. But nouns a re not  actionable. They are things. You can't build system s or develop  incentives around those things. It's nearly impossi ble to hold people  accountable to nouns.   ======================================== [Página 79] ======================================== CLARITY, DISCIPLINE AND CONSISTENCY  73 "A little more innovation today if you would please , Bob." And if  you have to write "honesty" on your wall to remind you to do it,  then you probably have bigger problems anyway.   For values or guiding principles to be truly effect ive they have to  be verbs. It's not "integrity," it's "always do the  right thing." It's not  "innovation," it's "look at the problem from a diff erent angle."  Articulating our values as verbs gives us a clear i dea ... we have a  clear idea of how to act in any situation. We can h old each other  accountable to them measure them or even build ince ntives around  them. Telling people to have integrity doesn't guar antee that their  decisions will always keep customers' or clients' b est interest in  mind; telling them to always do the right thing doe s. I wonder what  values Samsung had written on the wall when they de veloped that  rebate that wasn't applicable to people living in a partment  buildings.   The Golden Circle offers an explanation for long-te rm success,  but the inherent nature of doing things for the lon g term often  includes investments or short-term costs. This is t he reason the  discipline to stay focused on the WHY and remain tr ue to your  values matters so much.   Consistency of WHAT   Everything you say and everything you do has to pro ve what  you believe. A WHY is just a belief. That's all it is. HOWs are the  actions you take to realize that belief. And WHATs are the results of  those actions—everything you say and do: your produ cts, services,  marketing, PR, culture and whom you hire. If people  don't buy  WHAT you do but WHY you do it, then all these thing s must be  consistent. With consistency people will see and he ar, without a  shadow of a doubt, what you believe. After all, we live in a tangible  world. The only way people will know what you belie ve is by the  ======================================== [Página 80] ======================================== START WITH WHY  74 things you say and do, and if you're not consistent  in the things you  say and do, no one will know what you believe.   It is at the WHAT level that authenticity happens. "Authenticity"  is that word so often bandied about in the corporat e and political  worlds. Everyone talks about the importance of bein g authentic.  "You must be  authentic ," experts say. "All the trend data shows that  people prefer to do business with  authentic  brands." "People vote for  the  authentic  candidate." The problem is, that instruction is to tally  unactionable.   How do you go into somebody's office and say, "From  now on,  please, a little more authenticity." "That marketin g piece you're  working on," a CEO might instruct, "please make it a little more  authentic." What do companies do to make their mark eting or their  sales or whatever they're doing authentic?   The common solution is hilarious to me. They go out  and do  customer research and they ask the customers, what would we have  to tell you for us to be authentic? This entirely m isses the point. You  can't ask others what you have to do to be authenti c. Being authentic  means that you already know. What does a politician  say when told  to be "more authentic"? How does a leader act more "authentically"?  Without a clear understanding of WHY, the instructi on is  completely useless.   What authenticity means is that your Golden Circle is in balance.  It means that everything you say and everything you  do you actually   believe. This goes for management as well as the em ployees. Only  when that happens can the things you say and do be viewed as  authentic. Apple believed that its original Apple c omputer and its  Macintosh challenged the dominant IBM DOS platforms . Apple  believes its iPod and iTunes products are challengi ng the status quo  in the music industry. And we all understand WHY Ap ple does  what it does. It is because of that mutual understa nding that we  view those Apple products as authentic. Dell introd uced mp3  ======================================== [Página 81] ======================================== CLARITY, DISCIPLINE AND CONSISTENCY  75 players and PDAs in an attempt to enter the small e lectronics  business. We don't know what Dell's WHY is, we have  no certainty  about what the company believes or WHY it produced those prod- ucts beyond self-gain and a desire to capitalize on  a new market  segment. Those products are not authentic. It's not  that Dell couldn't  enter other markets—it certainly has the knowledge and ability to  make good products—but its ability to do so without  a clear  understanding of WHY is what makes it much harder a nd much  more expensive. Just producing high-quality product s and  marketing them does not guarantee success. Authenti city cannot be  achieved without clarity of WHY. And authenticity m atters.   Ask the best salesmen what it takes to be a great s alesman. They  will always tell you that it helps when you really believe in the  product you're selling. What does  belief  have to do with a sales job?  Simple. When salesmen actually believe in the thing  they are selling,  then the words that come out of their mouths are au thentic. When  belief enters the equation, passion exudes from the  salesman. It is  this authenticity that produces the relationships u pon which all the  best sales organizations are based. Relationships a lso build trust.  And with trust comes loyalty. Absent a balanced Gol den Circle  means no authenticity, which means no strong relati onships, which  means no trust. And you're back at square one selli ng on price,  service, quality or features. You are back to being  like everyone else.  Worse, without that authenticity, companies resort to manipulation:  pricing, promotions, peer pressure, fear, take your  pick. Effective?  Of course, but only for the short term.   Being authentic is not a requirement for success, b ut it is if you  want that success to be a lasting success. Again, i t goes back to  WHY. Authenticity is when you say and do the things  you actually  believe. But if you don't know WHY the organization  or the  products exist on a level beyond WHAT you do, then it is  impossible to know if the things you say or do are consistent with  ======================================== [Página 82] ======================================== START WITH WHY  76 your WHY. Without WHY, any attempt at authenticity will almost  always be inauthentic.   The Right Order   After you have clarity of WHY, are disciplined and accountable  to your own values and guiding principles, and are consistent in all  you say and do, the final step is to keep it all in  the right order. Just  like that little Apple marketing example I used ear lier, simply  changing the order of the information, starting wit h WHY, changed  the impact of the message. The WHATs are important— they pro- vide the tangible proof of the WHY—but WHY must com e first. The  WHY provides the context for everything else. As yo u will see over  and over in all the cases and examples in this book , whether in  leadership, decision-making or communication, start ing with WHY  has a profound and long-lasting impact on the resul t. Starting with  WHY is what inspires people to act.   If You Don't Know WHY, You Can't Know HOW   Rollin King, a San Antonio businessman, hatched the  idea to take  what Pacific Southwest was doing in California and bring it to  Texas—to start an airline that flew short-haul flig hts between Dallas,  Houston and San Antonio. He had recently gone throu gh a long and  messy divorce and turned to the one man he trusted to help him get  his idea off the ground. His Wild Turkey-drinking, chain-smoking  divorce lawyer, Herb Kelleher.   In nearly every way, King and Kelleher were opposit es. King, a  numbers guy, was notoriously gruff and awkward, whi le Kelleher  was gregarious and likable. At first Kelleher calle d King's idea a  dumb one, but by the end of the evening King had su ccessfully  inspired him with his vision and Kelleher agreed to  consider coming  on board. It would take four years, however, before  Southwest  ======================================== [Página 83] ======================================== CLARITY, DISCIPLINE AND CONSISTENCY  77 Airlines would make its first flight from Dallas's Love Field to  Houston.   Southwest did not invent the concept of a low-cost airline. Pacific  Southwest Airlines pioneered the industry—Southwest  even copied  their name. Southwest had no first mover's advantag e—Braniff In- ternational Airways, Texas International Airlines a nd Continental  Airlines were already serving the Texas market, and  none was eager  to give up any ground. But Southwest was not built to be an airline.  It was built to champion a cause. They just happene d to use an air- line to do it.   In the early 1970s, only 15 percent of the travelin g population  traveled by air. At that rate, the market was small  enough to scare  off most would-be competitors to the big airlines. But Southwest  wasn't interested in competing against everyone els e for 15 percent  of the traveling population. Southwest cared about the other 85  percent. Back then, if you asked Southwest whom the ir competition  was, they would have told you, "We compete against the car and the  bus." But what they meant was, "We're the champion for the  common man." That was WHY they started the airline.  That was  their cause, their purpose, their reason for existi ng. HOW they went  about building their company was not a strategy dev eloped by a  high-priced management consultancy. It wasn't a col lection of best  practices that they saw other companies doing. Thei r guiding  principles and values stemmed directly from their W HY and were  more common sense than anything else.   In the 1970s, air travel was expensive, and if Sout hwest was  going to be the champion for the common man, they h ad to be  cheap. It was an imperative. And in a day and age w hen air travel  was elitist—back then people wore ties on planes—as  the champion  for the common man, Southwest had to be fun. It was  an imperative.  In a time when air travel was complicated, with dif ferent prices  depending on when you booked, Southwest had to be s imple. If  ======================================== [Página 84] ======================================== START WITH WHY  78 they were to be accessible to the other 85 percent,  then simplicity  was an imperative. At the time, Southwest had two p rice categories:  nights/weekends and daytime. That was it.   Cheap, fun and simple. That's HOW they did it. That 's how they  were to champion the cause of the common man. The r esult of their  actions was made tangible in the things they said a nd did— their  product, the people they hired, their culture and t heir marketing.  "You are now free to move about the country," they said in their  advertising. That's much more than a tagline. That' s a cause. And  it's a cause looking for followers. Those who could  relate to  Southwest, those who saw themselves as average Joes , now had an  alternative to the big airlines. And those who beli eved what South-  west believed became fiercely loyal to the company.  They felt  Southwest was a company that spoke directly to them  and directly  for them. More importantly, they felt that flying S outhwest said  something about who they were as people. The loyalt y that devel- oped with their customers had nothing to do with pr ice. Price was  simply one of the ways the airline brought their ca use to life.   Howard Putnam, one of the former presidents of Sout hwest,  likes to tell a story of a senior executive of a la rge company who  approached him after an event. The executive said h e always flew  one of the big airlines when he traveled on busines s. He had to, it  was a company mandate. And although he had accumula ted many  frequent flier miles on the other airline and money  was no object,  when he flew for himself or with his family, he alw ays flew South- west. "He loves Southwest," Putnam says with a grin  when he tells  the story. Just because Southwest is cheap doesn't mean it only ap- peals to those with less money. Cheap is just one o f the things  Southwest does that helps us understand what they b elieve.   What Southwest has achieved is the stuff of busines s folklore. As  a result of WHY they do what they do, and because t hey are highly  disciplined in HOW they do it, they are the most pr ofitable airline  ======================================== [Página 85] ======================================== CLARITY, DISCIPLINE AND CONSISTENCY  79 in history. There has never been a year that they d idn't turn a profit,  including after September 11 and during the oil cri ses of the 1970s  and early 2000s. Everything Southwest says and does  is authentic.  Everything about them reflects the original cause K ing and Kelleher  set out to champion decades earlier. It has never v eered.   Fast-forward about thirty years. United Airlines an d Delta Air- lines looked at the success of Southwest and decide d they needed a  low-cost product to compete and share in Southwest' s success. "We  got to get us one of those," they thought. In April  2003, Delta  launched their low-cost alternative, Song. Less tha n a year later  United launched Ted. In both cases, they copied HOW  Southwest  did it. They made Ted and Song cheap, fun and simpl e. And for  anyone who ever flew Ted or Song, they were cheap, they were fun  and they were simple. But both failed.   United and Delta were both old hands in the airline  business and  were every bit qualified to add whatever products t hey wanted to  adapt to market conditions or seize opportunities. The problem was  not with WHAT they did, the problem was, no one kne w WHY  Song or Ted existed. They may have even been better  than South- west. But it didn't matter. Sure, people flew them,  but there are  always reasons people do business with you that hav e nothing to do  with you. That people can be motivated to use your product is not  the issue; the problem was that too few were loyal to the brands.  Without a sense of WHY, Song and Ted were just anot her couple of  airlines. Without a clear sense of WHY, all that pe ople had to judge  them on was price or convenience. They were commodi ties that had  to rely on manipulations to build their businesses,  an expensive  proposition. United abandoned its entry into the lo w-cost airline  business just four years after it began, and Delta' s Song also took its  last flight only four years after it launched.   It is a false assumption that differentiation happe ns in HOW and  WHAT you do. Simply offering a high-quality product  with more  ======================================== [Página 86] ======================================== START WITH WHY  80 features or better service or a better price does n ot create difference.  Doing so guarantees no success. Differentiation hap pens in WHY  and HOW you do it. Southwest isn't the best airline  in the world.  Nor are they always the cheapest. They have fewer r outes than  many of their competition and don't even fly outsid e the continental  United States. WHAT they do is not always significa ntly better. But  WHY they do it is crystal clear and everything they  do proves it.  There are many ways to motivate people to do things , but loyalty  comes from the ability to inspire people. Only when  the WHY is  clear and when people believe what you believe can a true loyal  relationship develop.   Manipulation and Inspiration Are Similar, but Not t he Same   Manipulation and inspiration both tickle the limbic  brain.  Aspirational messages, fear or peer pressure all pu sh us to decide  one way or another by appealing to our irrational d esires or playing  on our fears. But it's when that emotional feeling goes deeper than  insecurity or uncertainty or dreams that the emotio nal reaction  aligns with how we view ourselves. It is at that po int that behavior  moves from being motivated to inspired. When we are  inspired, the  decisions we make have more to do with who we are a nd less to do  with the companies or the products we're buying.   When our decisions  feel right, we're willing to pay a premium or  suffer an inconvenience for those products or servi ces. This has  nothing to do with price or quality. Price, quality , features and ser- vice are important, but they are the cost of entry in business today. It  is those visceral limbic feelings that create loyal ty. And it is that  loyalty that gives Apple or Harley-Davidson or Sout hwest Airlines  or Martin Luther King or any other great leader who  commands a  following such a huge advantage. Without a strong b ase of loyal  followers, the pressure increases to manipulate—to compete or  ======================================== [Página 87] ======================================== CLARITY, DISCIPLINE AND CONSISTENCY  81 "differentiate" based on price, quality, service or  features. Loyalty,  real emotional value, exists in the brain of the bu yer, not the seller.   It's hard to make a case to someone that your produ cts or ser- vices are important in their lives based on externa l rational factors  that  you  have defined as valuable (remember the Ferrari ver sus the  Honda). However, if your WHYs and their WHY corresp ond, then  they will see your products and services as tangibl e ways to prove  what  they  believe. When WHY, HOW, and WHAT are in balance,  authenticity is achieved and the buyer feels fulfil led. When they are  out of balance, stress or uncertainty exists. When that happens, the  decisions we make will also be out of balance. With out WHY, the  buyer is easily motivated by aspiration or fear. At  that point, it is the  buyer who is at the greatest risk of ending up bein g inauthentic. If  they buy something that doesn't clearly embody thei r own sense of  WHY, then those around them have little evidence to  paint a clear  and accurate picture of who they are.   The human animal is a social animal. We're very goo d at sensing  subtleties in behavior and judging people according ly. We get good  feelings and bad feelings about companies, just as we get good  feelings and bad feelings about people. There are s ome people we  just feel we can trust and others we just feel we c an't. Those feelings  also manifest when organizations try to court us. O ur ability to feel  one way or another toward a person or an organizati on is the same.  What changes is who is talking to us, but it is alw ays a single indi- vidual who is listening. Even when a company airs i ts message on  TV, for example, no matter how many people see the commercial, it  is always and only an individual that can receive t he message. This  is the value of The Golden Circle; it provides a wa y to communicate  consistent with how individuals receive information . For this reason  an organization must be clear about its purpose, ca use or belief and  make sure that everything they say and do is consis tent with and  authentic to that belief. If the levels of The Gold en Circle are in  ======================================== [Página 88] ======================================== START WITH WHY  82 balance, all those who share the organization's vie w of the world  will be drawn to it and its products like a moth to  a light bulb.   Doing Business Is Like Dating   I'd like to introduce you to our imaginary friend B rad. Brad is  going on a date tonight. It's a first date and he's  pretty excited. He  thinks the woman he's about to meet is really beaut iful and that she  makes a great prospect. Brad sits down for dinner a nd he starts  talking.   "I am extremely rich."   "I have a big house and I drive a beautiful car."   "I know lots of famous people."   "I'm on TV all the time, which is good because I'm good-  looking."   "I've actually done pretty well for myself."   The question is, does Brad get a second date?   The way we communicate and the way we behave is all  a matter of  biology. That means we can make some comparisons be tween the  things we do in our social lives and the things we do in our  professional lives. After all, people are people. T o learn how to  apply. WHY to a business situation, you needn't loo k much farther  than how we act on a date. Because, in reality, the re is no difference  between sales and dating. In both circumstances, yo u sit across a  table from someone and hope to say enough of the ri ght things to  close the deal. Of course, you could always opt for  a manipulation  or two, a fancy dinner, dropping hints of tickets t hat you have or  whom you know. Depending on how badly you want to c lose the  deal, you could tell them anything they want to hea r. Promise them  the world and the odds are good that you will close  the deal. Once.  ======================================== [Página 89] ======================================== CLARITY, DISCIPLINE AND CONSISTENCY  83 Maybe twice. With time, however, maintaining that r elationship  will cost more and more. No matter the manipulation s you choose,  this is not the way to build a trusting relationshi p.   In Brad's case, it is obvious that the date did not  go well. The  odds are not good that he will get a second date, a nd he's certainly  not done a good job of laying down the foundation t o build a rela- tionship. Ironically, the woman's initial interest may have been gen- erated based on those elements. She agreed to go on  the date  because her friends told her that Brad was good-loo king and that he  had a good job and that he knew a lot of famous peo ple. Even  though all those things may be true, WHATs don't dr ive decision- making, WHATs should be used as proof of WHY, and t he date  plainly fell flat.   Let's send Brad out again, but this time he's going  to start with  WHY.   "You know what I love about my life?" he starts thi s time. "I get  to wake up every day to do something I love. I get to inspire people  to do the things that inspire them. It's the most w onderful thing in  the world. In fact, the best part is trying to figu re out all the dif- ferent ways I can do that. It really is amazing. An d believe it or not,  I've actually been able to make a lot of money from  it. I bought a big  house and a nice car. I get to meet lots of famous people and I get to  be on TV all the time, which is fun, because I'm go od- looking. I'm  very lucky that I'm doing something that I love, I' ve actually been  able to do pretty well because of it."   This time the chances Brad will get a second date, assuming that  whoever is sitting across from him believes what he  believes, went  up exponentially. More importantly, he's also layin g a good foun- dation for a relationship, one based on values and beliefs. He said all  the same things as on the first date; the only diff erence is he started  with WHY, and all the WHATs, all the tangible benef its, served as  proof of that WHY.   ======================================== [Página 90] ======================================== START WITH WHY  84 Now consider how most companies do business. Someon e sits  down across a table from you, they've heard you're a good prospect,  and they start talking.   "Our company is extremely successful."   "We have beautiful offices, you should stop by and check them  out sometime."   "We do business with all the biggest companies and brands."   "I'm sure you've seen our advertising."   "We're actually doing pretty well."   In business, like a bad date, many companies work s o hard to  prove their value without saying WHY they exist in the first place.  You'll have to do more than show your resume before  someone  finds you appealing, however. But that is exactly w hat companies  do. They provide you with a long list of their expe rience—WHAT  they've done, whom they know—all with the idea that  you will find  them so desirable that you will have to drop everyt hing to do busi- ness with them.   People are people and the biology of decision-makin g is the same  no matter whether it is a personal decision or a bu siness decision.  It's obvious that in the dating scenario it was a b ad date, so why  would we expect it to be any different in the busin ess scenario?   Like on a date, it is exceedingly difficult to star t building a trusting  relationship with a potential customer or client by  trying to  convince them of all the rational features and bene fits. Those things  are important, but they serve only to give credibil ity to a sales pitch  and allow buyers to rationalize their purchase deci sion. As with all  decisions, people don't buy WHAT you do, they buy W HY you do  it, and WHAT you do serves as the tangible proof of  WHY you do it.  But unless you start with WHY, all people have to g o on are the  rational benefits. And chances are you won't get a second date.   Here's the alternative:   ======================================== [Página 91] ======================================== CLARITY, DISCIPLINE AND CONSISTENCY  85 "You know what I love about our company? Every sing le one of  us comes to work every day to do something we love.  We get to  inspire people to do the things that inspire them. It's the most won- derful thing in the world. In fact, the fun part is  trying to figure out  all the different ways we can do that. It really is  amazing. The best  part is, it is also good for business. We do really  well. We have beau- tiful offices, you should stop by sometime to see. We work with  some of the biggest companies. I'm sure you've seen  our ads. We're  actually doing pretty well."   Now, how certain are you that the second pitch was better than  the first?   Three Degrees of Certainty   When we can only provide a rational basis for a dec ision, when  we can only point to tangible elements or rational measurements,  the highest level of confidence we can give is, "I  think  this is the right  decision." That would be biologically accurate beca use we're  activating the neocortex, the "thinking" part of ou r brain. At a  neocortical level we can verbalize our thoughts. Th is is what's hap- pening when we spend all that time sifting through the pros and  cons, listening to all the differences between plas ma or LCD, Dell  versus HP.   When we make gut decisions, the highest level of co nfidence we  can offer is, "The decision  feels  right," even if it flies in the face of all  the facts and figures. Again, this is biologically accurate, because gut  decisions happen in the part of the brain that cont rols our emotions,  not language. Ask the most successful entrepreneurs  and leaders  what their secret is and invariably they all say th e same thing: "I  trust my gut." The times things went wrong, they wi ll tell you, "I  listened to what others were telling me, even thoug h it didn't feel  right. I should have trusted my gut." It's a good s trategy, except it's  not scalable. The gut decision can only be made by a single person.  ======================================== [Página 92] ======================================== START WITH WHY  86 It's a perfectly good strategy for an individual or  a small  organization, but what happens when success necessi tates that more  people be able to make decisions  that feel  right?   That's when the power of WHY can be fully realized.  The ability  to put a WHY into words provides the emotional cont ext for deci- sions. It offers greater confidence than "I think i t's right." It's more  scalable than "I feel it's right." When you know yo ur WHY, the  highest level of confidence you can offer is, "I  know  it's right." When  you  know  the decision is right, not only does it feel right , but you can  also rationalize it and easily put it into words. T he decision is fully  balanced. The rational WHATs offer proof for the fe eling of WHY. If  you can verbalize the feeling that drove the gut de cision, if you can  clearly state your WHY, you'll provide a clear cont ext for those  around you to understand why that decision was made . If the  decision is consistent with the facts and figures, then those facts and  figures serve to reinforce the decision—this is bal ance. And if the  decision flies in the face of all the facts and fig ures then it will  highlight the other factors that need to be conside red. It can turn a  controversial decision from a debate into a discuss ion.   My former business partner, for example, would get upset when  I turned away business. I would tell him that a pot ential client didn't  "feel" right. That would frustrate him to no end be cause "the client's  money was as good as everyone else's," he would tel l me. He  couldn't understand the reason for my decision and,  worse, I  couldn't explain it. It was just a feeling I had. I n contrast, these days  I can easily explain WHY I'm in business—to inspire  people to do  the things that inspire them. If I were to make the  same decision  now for the same gut reason, there is no debate bec ause everyone is  clear WHY the decision was made. We turn away busin ess because  those potential clients don't believe what we belie ve and they are not  interested in anything to do with inspiring people.

The goal of business should not be to do business w ith anyone  who simply wants what you have. It should be to foc us on the peo- ple who believe what you believe. When we are selec tive about  doing business only with those who believe in our W HY, trust  emerges.  ======================================== [Página 94] ========================================   88  ======================================== [Página 95] ========================================   89   PART 3       LEADERS  NEED A  FOLLOWING    ======================================== [Página 96] ========================================   90  ======================================== [Página 97] ========================================   91 6    THE EMERGENCE OS TRUST  To say that most of the company's employees were em barrassed  to work there was an understatement. It was no secr et that the em- ployees felt mistreated. And if a company mistreats  their people, just  watch how the employees treat their customers. Mud rolls down a  hill, and if you're the one standing at the bottom,  you get hit with  the full brunt. In a company, that's usually the cu stomer.  Throughout the 1980s, this was life at Continental Airlines—the  worst airline in the industry.   "I could see Continental's biggest problem the seco nd I walked in  the door in February of 1994," Gordon Bethune wrote  in  From Worst  to First,  the chief executive's firsthand account of Contine ntal's  turnaround. "It was a crummy place to work." Employ ees were  ======================================== [Página 98] ======================================== START WITH WHY  92 "surly to customers, surly to each other, and asham ed of their com- pany. And you can't have a good product without peo ple who like  coming to work. It just can't be done," he recounts .   Herb Kelleher, the head of Southwest for twenty yea rs, was con- sidered a heretic for positing the notion that it i s a company's re- sponsibility to look after the employees first. Hap py employees  ensure happy customers, he said. And happy customer s ensure  happy shareholders—in that order. Fortunately, Beth une shared this  heretical belief.   Some would argue that the reason Continental's cult ure was so  poisonous was that the company was struggling. They  would tell  you that it's hard for executives to focus on anyth ing other than  survival when a company is facing hard times. "Once  we get profit- able again," the logic went, "then we will take a l ook at everything  else." And without a doubt, throughout the 1980s an d early 1990s,  Continental struggled. The company filed for Chapte r 11 bank- ruptcy protection twice in eight years—once in 1983  and again in  1991—and managed to go through ten CEOs in a decade . In 1994,  the year Bethune took over as the newest CEO, the c ompany had  lost $600 million and ranked last in every measurab le performance  category.   But all that didn't last long once Bethune arrived.  The very next  year Continental made $250 million and was soon ran ked as one of  the best companies to work for in America. And whil e Bethune  made significant changes to improve the operations,  the greatest  gains were in a performance category that is nearly  impossible to  measure: trust.   Trust does not emerge simply because a seller makes  a rational  case why the customer should buy a product or servi ce, or because  an executive promises change. Trust is not a checkl ist. Fulfilling all  your responsibilities does not create trust. Trust is a feeling, not a  rational experience. We trust some people and compa nies even  ======================================== [Página 99] ======================================== THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST  93 when things go wrong, and we don't trust others eve n though ev- erything might have gone exactly as it should have.  A completed  checklist does not guarantee trust. Trust begins to  emerge when we  have a sense that another person or organization is  driven by things  other than their own self-gain.   With trust comes a sense of value—real value, not j ust value  equated with money. Value, by definition, is the tr ansference of  trust. You can't convince someone you have value, j ust as you can't  convince someone to trust you. You have to earn tru st by commu- nicating and demonstrating that you share the same values and  beliefs. You have to talk about your WHY and prove it with W HAT  you do. Again, a WHY is just a belief, HOWs are the  actions we take  to realize that belief, and WHATs are the results o f those actions.  When all three are in balance, trust is built and v alue is perceived.  This is what Bethune was able to do.   There are many talented executives with the ability  to manage  operations, but great leadership is not based solel y on great opera- tional ability. Leading is not the same as being th e leader. Being the  leader means you hold the highest rank, either by e arning it, good  fortune or navigating internal politics. Leading, h owever, means  that others willingly follow you—not because they h ave to, not be- cause they are paid to, but because they want to. F rank Lorenzo,  CEO before Bethune, may have been the leader of Con tinental, but  Gordon Bethune knew how to lead the company. Those who lead  are able to do so because those who follow trust th at the decisions  made at the top have the best interest of the group  at heart. In turn,  those who trust work hard because they feel like th ey are working  for something bigger than themselves.   Prior to Bethune's arrival, the twentieth floor of the company's  headquarters, the executive floor, was off-limits t o most people. The  executive suites were locked. Only those with a ran k of senior vice  president or higher were permitted to visit. Key ca rds were required  ======================================== [Página 100] ======================================== START WITH WHY  94 to get onto the floor, security cameras were ubiqui tous and armed  guards roamed the floor to eliminate any doubt that  the security was  no joke. Clearly, the company suffered from trust i ssues. One story  handed down was that Frank Lorenzo would not even d rink a soda  on a Continental plane if he didn't open the can hi mself. He didn't  trust anyone, so it is no great leap of logic that no one trusted him.  It's hard to lead when those whom you are supposed to be leading  are not inclined to follow.   Bethune was very different. He understood that beyo nd the  structure and systems a company is nothing more tha n a collection  of people. "You don't lie to your own doctor," he s ays, "and you  can't lie to your own employees." Bethune set out t o change the  culture by giving everyone something they could bel ieve in. And  what, specifically, did he give them to believe in that could turn the  worst airline in the industry into the best airline  in the industry with  all the same people and all the same equipment?   In college I had a roommate named Howard Jeruchimow itz.  Now an attorney in Chicago, Howard learned from an early age  about a very simple human desire. Growing up in the  suburbs of  New York City, he played outfield on the worst team  in the Little  League. They lost nearly every game they played—and  not by small  margins either; they were regularly annihilated. Th eir coach was a  good man and wanted to instill a positive attitude in the young  athletes. After one of their more embarrassing loss es, the coach  pulled the team together and reminded them, "It doe sn't matter who  wins or loses, what matters is how you play the gam e." It was at this  point that young Howard raised his hand and asked, "Then why do  we keep score?"   Howard understood from a very young age the very hu man  desire to win. No one likes to lose, and most healt hy people live  their life to win. The only variation is the score we use. For some it's  money, for others it's fame or awards. For some it' s power, love, a  ======================================== [Página 101] ======================================== THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST  95 family or spiritual fulfillment. The metric is rela tive, but the desire is  the same. A billionaire doesn't need to work. Money  becomes a way  to keep score—a relative account of how things are going. Even a  billionaire who loses millions due to poor decision s can get de- pressed. Although the money may have zero impact on  his lifestyle,  no one likes to lose.   The drive to win is not, per se, a bad thing. Probl ems arise, how- ever, when the metric becomes the only measure of s uccess, when  what you achieve is no longer tied to WHY you set o ut to achieve it  in the first place.   Bethune set out to prove to everyone at Continental  that if they  wanted to win, they could win. And most of the empl oyees stuck  around to find out if he was right. There were a fe w exceptions. One  executive who once held up a plane because he was r unning late  was asked to leave, as were thirty-nine more of the  top sixty  executives who didn't believe. No matter how experi enced they  were or what they brought to the table, they were a sked to leave if  they weren't team players and weren't able to adapt  to the new cul- ture that Bethune was trying to build. There was no  room for those  who didn't believe in the new Continental.   Bethune knew that building a team to go out and win  meant  more than giving a few rah-rah speeches and bonuses  for the top  brass if they hit certain revenue targets. He knew that if he wanted  to build a real, lasting success, people had to win  not for him, not  for the shareholders and not even for the customer.  For the success  to last the employees of Continental had to want to  win for  themselves.   Everything he talked about was in terms of how it b enefited the  employees. Instead of telling them to keep the plan es clean for cus- tomers, he pointed out something more obvious. Ever y day they  came to work on a plane. The passengers left after their flight, but  ======================================== [Página 102] ======================================== START WITH WHY  96 many of the flight attendants had to stay on for at  least one more  trip. It's just nicer to come to work when the envi ronment is cleaner.   Bethune also got rid of all the security on the twe ntieth floor. He  instituted an open-door policy and made himself inc redibly  accessible. It was common for him to show up and sl ing bags with  some of the baggage handlers at the airport. From n ow on, this was  a family and everyone had to work together.   Bethune focused on the things they knew to be impor tant, and to an  airline the most important thing is to get the plan es running on time.  In the early 1990s, before Bethune arrived, Contine ntal had the  lowest on-time rating of the nation's ten largest a irlines. So Bethune  told employees that each month Continental's on-tim e percentage  ranked in the top five, every employee would receiv e a check for  $65. When you consider that Continental had 40,000 employees in  1995, every on-time month cost the airline a whoppi ng $2.5 million,  But Bethune knew he was getting a deal: being chron ically late was  costing it $5 million a month in expenses like miss ed connections  and putting passengers up overnight. But most impor tant to  Bethune was what the bonus program did for the com-  pany  culture: it got tens of thousands of employees, inc luding managers,  all pointed in the same direction for the first tim e in years.   Gone were the days when only the brass would enjoy the ben- efits of success. Everyone got their $65 when the a irline did well and  no one got it when the airline missed its targets. Bethune even  insisted that a separate check be sent out. It wasn 't just added to  their salary check. This was different. This was a symbol of winning.  And on every check a message reminded them WHY they  came to  work: "Thank you for helping make Continental one o f the best."   "We measured things the employees could truly contr ol," Be- thune said. "We made the stakes something the emplo yees would  win or lose on together, not separately."   ======================================== [Página 103] ======================================== THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST  97 Everything they did made people feel like they were  in it  together. And they were.   The Only Difference Between You and a  Caveman Is the Car You Drive    The reason the human race has been so successful is  not because  we're the strongest animals—far from it. Size and m ight alone do  not guarantee success. We've succeeded as a species  because of our  ability to form cultures. Cultures are groups of pe ople who come  together around a common set of values and beliefs.  When we share  values and beliefs with others, we form trust. Trus t of others allows  us to rely on others to help protect our children a nd ensure our  personal survival. The ability to leave the den to hunt or explore  with confidence that the community will protect you r family and  your stuff until you return is one of the most impo rtant factors in  the survival of an individual and the advancement o f our species.   That we trust people with common values and beliefs  is not, in  itself, a profound assertion. There is a reason we' re not friends with  everyone we meet. We're friends with people who see  the world the  way we see it, who share our views and our belief s et. No matter  how good a match someone looks on paper, that doesn 't guarantee a  friendship. You can think of it on a macro scale al so. The world is  filled with different cultures. Being American is n ot better than  being French. They are just different cultures—not better or worse,  just different. American culture strongly values id eals of  entrepreneurship, independence and self-reliance. W e call our  WHY—the American Dream. French culture strongly val ues ideals  of unified identity, group reliance and joie de viv re. (Notice that we  use the French word to describe the joy-of-life lif estyle. Coinci- dence? Perhaps.) Some people are good fits in Frenc h culture and  ======================================== [Página 104] ======================================== START WITH WHY  98 some people are good fits in American culture. It i s not a matter of  better or worse, they are just different.   Most people who are born and raised in one culture will, for  obvious reasons, end up being a reasonably good fit  in that culture,  but not always. There are people who grew up in Fra nce who never  quite felt like they belonged; they were misfits in  their own culture.  So they moved, maybe to America. Drawn to the feeli ngs they had  for America's WHY, they followed the American Dream  and  emigrated.   It is always said that America is fueled in large p art by immi- grants. But it is completely false that all immigra nts make produc- tive members of a society. It's not true that all i mmigrants have an  entrepreneurial spirit—just the ones that are visce rally drawn to  America. That's what a WHY does. When it is clearly  understood, it  attracts people who believe the same thing. And ass uming they are  good fits for what Americans believe and how they d o things, those  immigrants will say of America, "I love it here," o r "I love this  country." This visceral reaction has less to do wit h America and  more to do with them. It's how they feel about thei r own opportu- nity and their own ability to thrive in a culture i n which they feel  like they belong versus the one they came from.   And within the big WHY that is America, it breaks d own even  further. Some people are better fits in New York an d some are better  fits in Minneapolis. One culture is not better or w orse than the other,  they are just different. Many people dream of movin g to New York,  for example, attracted to the glamour or the percep tion of  opportunity. They arrive with aspirations of making  it big, but they  fail to consider whether they will fit into the cul ture before they  make their move. Some make it. But so many don't. O ver and over,  I've seen people come to New York with big hopes an d dreams, but  either couldn't find the job they wanted or they fo und it but couldn't  take the pressure. They are not dumb or bad or poor  workers. They  ======================================== [Página 105] ======================================== THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST  99 were just bad fits. They either stay in New York an d exert more  effort than they need to, hating their jobs and the ir lives, or they  move. If they move to a city in which they are bett er fits— Chicago  or San Francisco or somewhere else—they often end u p much  happier and more successful. New York is not ration ally better than  other cities, it's just not right for everyone. Lik e all cities, it's only  right for those who are good fits.   The same can be said for any place that has a stron g culture or  recognizable personality. We do better in cultures in which we are  good fits. We do better in places that reflect our own values and  beliefs. Just as the goal is not to do business wit h anyone who sim- ply wants what you have, but to do business with pe ople who be- lieve what you believe, so too is it beneficial to live and work in a  place where you will naturally thrive because your values and be- liefs align with the values and beliefs of that cul ture.   Now consider what a company is. A company is a cult ure. A  group of people brought together around a common se t of values  and beliefs. It's not products or services that bin d a company to- gether. It's not size and might that make a company  strong, it's the  culture—the strong sense of beliefs and values that  everyone, from  the CEO to the receptionist, all share. So the logi c follows, the goal is  not to hire people who simply have a skill set you need, the goal is  to hire people who believe what you believe.   Finding the People Who Believe What You Believe   Early in the twentieth century, the English adventu rer Ernest Shack-  leton set out to explore the Antarctic. Roald Amund sen, a Norwe-  gian, had only just become the first explorer ever to reach the South  Pole, leaving one remaining conquest: the crossing of the continent  via the southernmost tip of the earth.   The land part of the expedition would start at the frigid Weddell  Sea, below South America, and travel 1,700 miles ac ross the pole to  ======================================== [Página 106] ======================================== START WITH WHY  100 the Ross Sea, below New Zealand. The cost, Shacklet on estimated at  the time, would be about $250,000. "The crossing of  the south polar  continent will be the biggest polar journey ever at tempted,"  Shackleton told a reporter for the  New York Times  on December 29,  1913. "The unknown fields in the world which are st ill unconquered  are narrowing down, but there still remains this gr eat work."   On December 5, 1914, Shackleton and a crew of twent y-seven  men set out for the Weddell Sea on the  Endurance,  a 350-ton ship  that had been constructed with funds from private d onors, the  British government and the Royal Geographical Socie ty. By then,  World War I was raging in Europe, and money was gro wing more  scarce. Donations from English schoolchildren paid for the dog  teams.   But the crew of the  Endurance  would never reach the continent of  Antarctica.   Just a few days out of South Georgia Island in the southern  Adantic, the ship encountered mile after mile of pa ck ice, and was  soon trapped as winter moved in early and with fury . Ice closed in  around the ship "like an almond in a piece of toffe e," a crew member  wrote. Shackleton and his crew were stranded in the  Antarctic for  ten months as the  Endurance  drifted slowly north, until the pressure  of the ice floes finally crushed the ship. On Novem ber 21, 1915, the  crew watched as she sank in the frigid waters of th e Weddell Sea.   Stranded on the ice, the crew of the  Endurance  boarded their  three lifeboats and landed on tiny Elephant Island.  There Shackleton  left behind all but five of his men and embarked on  a hazardous  journey across 800 miles of rough seas to find help . Which, eventu- ally, they did.   What makes the story of the  Endurance  so remarkable, however, is  not the expedition, it's that throughout the whole ordeal no one  died, There were no stories of people eating others  and no mutiny.   ======================================== [Página 107] ======================================== THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST  101 This was not luck. This was because Shackleton hire d good fits.  He found the right men for the job. When you fill a n organization  with good fits, those who believe what you believe,  success just  happens. And how did Shackleton find this amazing c rew? With a  simple ad in the London  Times.   Compare that to how we hire people. Like Shackleton , we run  ads in the newspaper, or on the modern equivalents,  Craigslist or  Monster.com. Sometimes we hire a recruiter to find someone for us,  but the process is largely the same. We provide a l ist of qualifica- tions for the job and expect that the best candidat e will be the one  who meets those requirements.   The issue is how we write those ads. They are all a bout WHAT  and not about WHY. A want ad might say, for example , "Account  executive needed, minimum five years' experience, m ust have  working knowledge of industry. Come work for a fant astic, fast- growing company with great pay and great benefits."  The ad may  produce loads of applicants, but how do we know whi ch is the right  fit?   Shackleton's ad for crew members was different. His  did not say  WHAT he was looking for. His ad did not say:   "Men needed for expedition. Minimum five years' exp erience.  Must know how to hoist mainsail. Come work for a fa ntastic  captain."   Rather, Shackleton was looking for those with somet hing more.  He was looking for a crew that belonged on such an expedition. His  actual ad ran like this:   "Men wanted for Hazardous journey. Small wages, bit ter cold,  long months of complete darkness, constant danger, safe return  doubtful. Honour and recognition in case of success ."   The only people who applied for the job were those who read the ad  and thought it sounded great. They loved insurmount able odds. The  only people who applied for the job were survivors.  Shackleton  ======================================== [Página 108] ======================================== START WITH WHY  102 hired only people who believed what he believed. Th eir ability to  survive was guaranteed. When employees belong, they  will  guarantee your success. And they won't be working h ard and  looking for innovative solutions for you, they will  be doing it for  themselves.   What all great leaders have in common is the abilit y to find good  fits to join their organizations—those who believe what they believe.  Southwest Airlines is a great example of a company with a knack for  hiring good fits. Their ability to find people who embody their cause  makes it much easier for them to provide great serv ice. As Herb  Kelleher famously said, "You don't hire for skills,  you hire for  attitude. You can always teach skills." This is all  fine and good; the  problem is, which attitude? What if their attitude is not one that fits  your culture?   I love asking companies whom they like to hire, and  one of the  most common answers I am given is, "We hire only pa ssionate  people." But how do you know if someone is passiona te for inter- viewing, but not so passionate for working? The tru th is, almost  every person on the planet is passionate, we are ju st not all pas- sionate for the same things. Starting with WHY when  hiring dra- matically increases your ability to attract those w ho are passionate  for what you believe. Simply hiring people with a s olid resume or  great work ethic does not guarantee success. The be st engineer at  Apple, for example, would likely be miserable if he  worked at Mi- crosoft. Likewise, the best engineer at Microsoft w ould probably not  thrive at Apple. Both are highly experienced and wo rk hard. Both  may come highly recommended. However, each engineer  does not  fit the culture of the other's company. The goal is  to hire those who  are passionate for your WHY, your purpose, cause or  belief, and  who have the attitude that fits your culture. Once that is established,  only then should their skill set and experience be evaluated.  Shackleton could have had the most experienced crew  money could  ======================================== [Página 109] ======================================== THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST  103 buy, but if they weren't able to connect on a level  much deeper than  their ability, their survival would not have been a  foregone  conclusion.   For years, Southwest didn't have a complaints depar tment— they  didn't need one. Though Kelleher rightly talked abo ut the need to  hire for attitude, the airline in fact deserves mor e credit for hiring  the good fits responsible for providing great servi ce. Kelleher was  not the only one making the hiring decisions, and a sking everyone  to simply trust their gut is too risky. Their geniu s came from  figuring out why some people were such good fits an d then devel- oping systems to find more of them.   In the 1970s, Southwest Airlines decided to put the ir flight at- tendants in hot pants and go-go boots as part of th eir uniforms (hey,  it was the 1970s). It wasn't their idea; Pacific So uthwest, the  California-based airline after which Southwest mode led itself, did it  first, Southwest simply copied them. Unlike Pacific  Southwest,  however, Southwest figured out something that would  prove in- valuable. They realized that when they recruited fl ight attendants,  the only people who applied for the job were cheerl eaders and  majorettes. That's because they were the only peopl e who didn't  mind wearing the new uniforms. Cheerleaders and maj orettes,  however, fit in perfectly at Southwest. They didn't  just have a great  attitude, their whole disposition was about cheerin g people on.  Spreading optimism. Leading crowds to believe that "we can win."  They were perfect fits at a company that was the ch ampion of the  common man. Realizing this, Southwest started to re cruit only  cheerleaders and majorettes.   Great companies don't hire skilled people and motiv ate them,  they hire already motivated people and inspire them . People are  either motivated or they are not. Unless you give m otivated people  something to believe in, something bigger than thei r job to work  ======================================== [Página 110] ======================================== START WITH WHY  104 toward, they will motivate themselves to find a new  job and you'll  be stuck with whoever's left.   Give 'Em a Cathedral   Consider the story of two stonemasons. You walk up to the first  stonemason and ask, "Do you like your job?" He look s up at you and  replies, "I've been building this wall for as long as I can remember.  The work is monotonous. I work in the scorching hot  sun all day.  The stones are heavy and lifting them day after day  can be  backbreaking. I'm not even sure if this project wil l be completed in  my lifetime. But it's a job. It pays the bills." Yo u thank him for his  time and walk on.   About thirty feet away, you walk up to a second sto nemason.  You ask him the same question, "Do you like your jo b?" He looks up  and replies, "I love my job. I'm building a cathedr al. Sure, I've been  working on this wall for as long as I can remember,  and yes, the  work is sometimes monotonous. I work in the scorchi ng hot sun all  day. The stones are heavy and lifting them day afte r day can be  backbreaking. I'm not even sure if this project wil l be completed in  my lifetime. But I'm building a cathedral."   WHAT these two stonemasons are doing is exactly the  same; the  difference is, one has a sense of purpose. He feels  like he belongs.  He comes to work to be a part of something bigger t han the job he's  doing. Simply having a sense of WHY changes his ent ire view of his  job. It makes him more productive and certainly mor e loyal.  Whereas the first stonemason would probably take an other job for  more pay, the inspired stonemason works longer hour s and would  probably turn down an easier, higher-paying job to stay and be a  part of the higher cause. The second stonemason doe s not see him- self as any more or less important than the guy mak ing the stained  glass windows or even the architect. They are all w orking together  to build the cathedral. It is this bond that create s camaraderie. And  ======================================== [Página 111] ======================================== THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST  105 that camaraderie and trust is what brings success. People working  together for a common cause.   Companies with a strong sense of WHY are able to in spire their  employees. Those employees are more productive and innovative,  and the feeling they bring to work attracts other p eople eager to  work there as well. It's not such a stretch to see why the companies  that we love to do business with are also the best employers. When  people inside the company know WHY they come to wor k, people  outside the company are vastly more likely to under stand WHY the  company is special. In these organizations, from th e management on  down, no one sees themselves as any more or any les s than anyone  else. They all need each other.   When Motivated by WHY, Success Just Happens   It was a turn-of-the-century version of the dot-com  boom. The  promise of a revolutionary new technology was chang ing the way  people imagined the future. And there was a race to  see who could  do it first. It was the end of the nineteenth centu ry and the new  technology was the airplane. One of the best-known men in the field  was Samuel Pierpont Langley. Like many other invent ors of his day,  he was attempting to build the world's first heavie r-than- air flying  machine. The goal was to be the first to achieve ma chine- powered,  controlled, manned flight. The good news was Langle y had all the  right ingredients for the enormous task; he had, wh at most would  define as, the recipe for success.   Langley had achieved some renown within the academi c com- munity as an astronomer, which earned him high-rank ing and  prestigious positions. He was secretary of the Smit hsonian Institu- tion. He had been an assistant in the Harvard Colle ge Observatory  and professor of mathematics at the United States N aval Academy.  Langley was very well connected. His friends includ ed some of the  most powerful men in government and business, inclu ding Andrew  ======================================== [Página 112] ======================================== START WITH WHY  106 Carnegie and Alexander Graham Bell. He was also ext remely well  funded. The War Department, the precursor the Depar tment of  Defense, had given him $50,000 for the project, a l ot of money in  those days. Money was no object.   Langley assembled some of the best and brightest mi nds of the  day. His dream team included test pilot Charles Man ly, a brilliant  Cornell-trained mechanical engineer, and Stephan Ba lzer, the de- veloper of the first car in New York. Langley and h is team used the  finest materials. The market conditions were perfec t and his PR was  great. The  New York Times  followed him around everywhere.  Everyone knew Langley and was rooting for his succe ss.   But there was a problem.   Langley had a bold goal, but he didn't have a clear  sense of  WHY. His purpose for wanting to build the plane was  defined in  terms of WHAT he was doing and WHAT he could get. H e had had  a passion for aeronautics since a very young age, b ut he did not  have a cause to champion. More than anything else, Langley  wanted to be first. He wanted to be rich and he wan ted to be  famous. That was his driving motivation.   Although already well regarded in his own field, he  craved the  kind of fame of a Thomas Edison or Alexander Graham  Bell, the  kind that comes only with inventing something big. Langley saw  the airplane as his ticket to fame and fortune. He was smart and  motivated. He had what we still assume is the recip e for success:  plenty of cash, the best people and ideal market co nditions. But few  of us have ever heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley.   A few hundred miles away in Dayton, Ohio, Orville a nd Wilbur  Wright were also building a flying machine. Unlike Langley, the  Wright brothers did not have the recipe for success . Worse, they  seemed to have the recipe for failure. There was no  funding for their  venture. No government grants. No high-level connec tions. The  Wright brothers funded their dream with the proceed s from their  ======================================== [Página 113] ======================================== THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST  107 bicycle shop. Not a single person working on the te am, including  Orville and Wilbur, had a college education; some d id not even fin- ish high school. What the Wright brothers were doin g wasn't any  different from Langley or all the others trying to build a flying ma- chine. But the Wright brothers did have something v ery special.  They had a dream. They knew WHY it was important to  build this  thing. They believed that if they could figure out this flying ma- chine, it would change the world. They imagined the  benefits to  everyone else if they were successful.   "Wilbur and Orville were true scientists, deeply an d genuinely  concerned about the physical problem they were tryi ng to solve—  the problem of balance and flight," said James Tobi n, the Wright  brothers' biographer. Langley, on the other hand, w as consumed  with acquiring the level of prestige of his associa tes like Alexander   Graham Bell, fame that he knew would come only with  a major sci- entific breakthrough. Langley, Tobin said, "did not  have the  Wrights' passion for flight, but rather was looking  for achievement."   Orville and Wilbur preached what they believed and inspired  others in the community to join them in their cause . The proof of  their commitment was self-evident. With failure aft er failure, most  would have given up, but not the Wright brothers' t eam. The team  was so inspired that no matter how many setbacks th ey suffered  they would show up for more. Every time the Wright brothers went  out to make a test flight, so the stories go, they would take five sets  of parts with them, because they knew that's how ma ny times they  were likely to fail before deciding to come home fo r the day.   Then it happened. On December 17, 1903, on a field in Kitty  Hawk, North Carolina, the Wright brothers took to t he sky. A fifty-  nine-second flight at an altitude of 120 feet at th e speed of a jog was  all it took to usher in a new technology that would  change the  world.   ======================================== [Página 114] ======================================== START WITH WHY  108 Remarkable as the achievement was, it went relative ly  unnoticed. The  New York Times  was not there to cover the story.  Driven by something bigger than fame and glory, the  Wright  brothers were content to wait to tell the world. Th ey understood its  true significance to the world.   What Langley and the Wright brothers were trying to  create was  exactly the same; both were building the same produ ct. Both the  Wright brothers and Langley were highly motivated. Both had a  strong work ethic. Both had keen scientific minds. What the Wright  brothers' team had that Langley did wasn't luck. It  was inspiration.  One was motivated by the prospect of fame and wealt h, the other by  a belief. The Wright brothers excited the human spi rit of those  around them. Langley paid for talent to help him ge t rich and  famous. The Wright brothers started with WHY. Furth er proof  Langley was motivated by WHAT, a few days after Orv ille and Wil- bur took flight, Langley quit. He got out of the bu siness. He could  have said, "That's amazing, now I'm going to improv e upon their  technology." But he didn't. He found the defeat hum iliating—his  own test flight had landed in the Potomac River, an d the newspa- pers all made fun of him. He cared so much about wh at others  thought of him, he was so preoccupied with becoming  famous. He  wasn't first, so he simply quit.   Innovation Happens at the Edges   Dream teams are not always so dreamy. When a team o f experts  comes together they often work for themselves and n ot for the good  of the whole. This is what happens when companies f eel the need to  pay mega-salaries to "get the best talent." Those p eople are not  necessarily showing up because they believe in your  WHY, they are  showing up for the money. A classic manipulation. P aying someone  a lot of money and asking them to come up with grea t ideas ensures  very little. However, pulling together a team of li ke- minded people  ======================================== [Página 115] ======================================== THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST  109 and giving them a cause to pursue ensures a greater  sense of  teamwork and camaraderie. Langley pulled together a  dream team  and promised them riches. The Wright brothers inspi red a group of  people to join them in pursuit of something bigger than each  member of the team. Average companies give their pe ople  something to work on. In contrast, the most innovat ive or- ganizations give their people something to work tow ard.   The role of a leader is not to come up with all the  great ideas. The  role of a leader is to create an environment in whi ch great ideas can  happen. It is the people inside the company, those on the front lines,  who are best qualified to find new ways of doing th ings. The people  who answer the phones and talk to customers, for ex ample, can tell  you more about the kinds of questions they get than  can anyone  sitting in an executive suite miles away. If the pe ople inside a  company are told to come to work and just do their job, that's all  they will do. If they are constantly reminded WHY t he company  was founded and told to always look for ways to bri ng that cause to  life while performing their job, however, then they  will do more  than their job.   Steve Jobs, for example, did not personally come up  with the iPod or  iTunes or the iPhone. Others inside the company did . Jobs gave  people a filter, a context, a higher purpose around  which to  innovate: find existing status-quo industries, thos e in which com- panies fight to protect their old-fashioned busines s models, and  challenge them. This is WHY Apple was founded, it i s what Jobs  and Wozniak did when they started the company, and it is what  Apple's people and products have done ever since. I t's a repeating  pattern. Apple's employees simply look for ways to bring their cause  to life in as many places as they can. And it works .   It is not the same at many other companies. Compani es that  define themselves by WHAT they do instead of WHY th ey do it  instruct their people to be innovative around a pro duct or service.  ======================================== [Página 116] ======================================== START WITH WHY  110 "Make it better," they are instructed. Those who wo rk for Apple's  competitors, companies that have defined themselves  as "computer  manufacturers," come to work to develop "more innov ative" com- puters. The best they can do is add more RAM, add a  feature or two,  or, as one PC maker has done, give people the optio n to customize  the color of their computer casing. This hardly qua lifies as an idea  with the potential to change the course of an indus try. A nice  feature, for sure, but not innovation. If you are c urious as to how  Colgate finds itself with thirty-two different type s of toothpaste  today, it is because every day its people come to w ork to develop a  better toothpaste and not, for example, to look for  ways to help  people feel more confident about themselves.   Apple does not have a lock on good ideas; there are  smart, in- novative thinkers at most companies. But great comp anies give their  people a purpose or challenge around which to devel op ideas rather  than simply instruct them to make a better mousetra p. Companies  that study their competitors in hopes of adding the  features and  benefits that will make  their  products "better" are only working to  entrench the company in WHAT it does. Companies wit h a clear  sense of WHY tend to ignore their competition, wher eas those with  a fuzzy sense of WHY are obsessed with what others are doing.   The ability of a company to innovate is not just us eful for de- veloping new ideas, it is invaluable for navigating  struggle. When  people come to work with a higher sense of purpose,  they find it  easier to weather hard times or even to find opport unity in those  hard times. People who come to work with a clear se nse of WHY are  less prone to giving up after a few failures becaus e they understand  the higher cause. Thomas Edison, a man definitely d riven by a  higher cause, said, "I didn't find a way to make a light bulb, I found  a thousand ways how not to make one."   Southwest Airlines is famous for pioneering the ten -minute  turnaround—the ability to deplane, prep, and board a plane in ten  ======================================== [Página 117] ======================================== THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST  111 minutes. This ability helps an airline make more mo ney, because the  more the planes are in the sky, the better the comp any is doing.  What few people realize is that this innovation was  born out of  struggle. In 1971, Southwest was running low on cas h and needed to  sell one of their aircraft to stay in business. Thi s left them with three  planes to fly a schedule that required four. They h ad two choices:  they could scale back their operations, or they cou ld figure out how  to turn their planes around in ten minutes. And thu s was born the  ten-minute turnaround.   Whereas most other airline employees would have sim ply said it  couldn't be done, Southwest's people rallied to fig ure out how to  perform the unprecedented and seemingly impossible task. Today,  their innovation is still paying dividends. Because  of increased  airport congestion and larger planes and cargo load s, Southwest  now takes about twenty-five minutes to turn their p lanes around.  However, if they were to try to keep the same sched ule but add  even five minutes to the turnaround time, they woul d need an  additional eighteen planes in their fleet at a cost  of nearly a billion  dollars.   Southwest's remarkable ability to solve problems, A pple's re- markable knack for innovation and the Wright brothe rs' ability to  develop a technology with the team they had were al l possible for  the same reason: they believed they could and they trusted their  people to do it.   The Definition of Trust   Founded by Sir Francis Baring in 1762, Barings Bank  was the oldest  merchant bank in England. The bank, which survived the Napole- onic Wars, World War I and World War II, was unable  to survive  the predilection for risk of one self-proclaimed ro gue trader. Nick  Leeson single-handedly brought down Barings Bank in  1995 by  performing some unauthorized, extremely high-risk t rades. Had the  proverbial winds continued to blow in the right dir ection, Leeson  ======================================== [Página 118] ======================================== START WITH WHY  112 would have made himself and the bank extremely rich  and he  would have been hailed as a hero.   But such is the nature of unpredictable things like  the weather  and financial markets. Few dispute that what Leeson  was doing was  anything more than gambling. And gambling is very d ifferent from  calculated risk. Calculated risk accepts that there  can be great loses,  but steps are taken to either guard against or resp ond to an unlikely  but possible outcome. Even though an emergency land ing on water  is "unlikely," as the airlines tell us, they still provide us lifejackets.  And if only for peace of mind, we're glad they do. To do otherwise  is a gamble few airlines would be willing to take, even though the  actuarial tables are heavily weighted on their side .   Leeson strangely held two positions at Barings, ost ensibly serv- ing as both a trader and his own supervisor, but th at fact is not  interesting given the subject matter. That one man had such a tol- erance for risk that he could create so much damage  is not very  interesting either. Both of those are short-term fa ctors. Both would  have ended if Leeson had either left the company or  changed jobs,  or if Barings had assigned a new supervisor to over see his opera- tions. What is more interesting is the culture at t he bank that could  allow these conditions to exist in the first place.  Barings had lost its  WHY.   The culture at Barings was no longer one in which p eople came  to work inspired. Motivated, yes, but not inspired.  Manipulated by  the promise of massive payouts for performance, for  sure, but not  inspired to work in the best interest of the whole.  As Leeson re-  ported in his own account of how he got away with s uch risky be- havior for so long, he said it was not that others didn't recognize  that what he was doing was potentially dangerous. I t was worse  than that. There was a stigma against speaking out.  "People at the  London end of Barings," Leeson explained, "were all  so know-all  that nobody dared ask a stupid question in case the y looked silly in  ======================================== [Página 119] ======================================== THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST  113 front of everyone else." The lack of a clear set of  values and beliefs,  along with the weak culture that resulted, created the conditions for  an every-man-for-himself environment, the long-term  impact of  which could yield little else than disaster. This i s caveman stuff. If  the people aren't looking out for the community, th en the benefits of  a community erode. Many companies have star employe es and star  salesmen and so on, but few have a culture that pro duces great  people as a rule and not an exception.   Trust is a remarkable thing. Trust allows us to rel y on others. We  rely on those we trust for advice to help us make d ecisions. Trust is  the bedrock for the advancement of our own lives, o ur families, our  companies, our societies and our species. We trust those in our  community to care for our children so we can go out  to dinner.  Given the choice between two babysitters, we're mor e likely to trust  a babysitter with a little experience from the neig hborhood than one  with lots of experience from far away. We wouldn't trust someone  from the outside because we don't know anything abo ut them, we  say. The reality is, we don't know anything about t he local  babysitter either, beyond the fact that she's from the neighborhood.  In this case, we trust familiarity over experience with something  quite important—the safety of our children. We trus t that someone  who lives in the community and more likely shares o ur values and  beliefs is better qualified to care for the most va luable thing in our  lives over someone with a long resume but from an u nfamiliar  place. That's pretty remarkable. It causes some pau se when we con- sider how we hire people: what's more important, th eir resume and  experience, or whether they will fit our community?  Our children  are probably more important than the position we wa nt to fill at the  organization, yet we seem to exercise a very differ ent standard.   Is there a false assumption at play here as to who makes the best  employee?   ======================================== [Página 120] ======================================== START WITH WHY  114 Historically, trust has played a bigger role in adv ancing compa- nies and societies than skill set alone. Like the c ouple leaving their  children while they go out on a date for the evenin g, groups from  within a society would go off with confidence, know ing that their  homes and families would be safe upon their return.  If there were  no trust, then no one would take risks. No risks wo uld mean no  exploration, no experimentation and no advancement of the society  as a whole. That's a remarkable concept: only when individuals can  trust the culture or organization will they take pe rsonal risks in  order to advance that culture or organization as a whole. For no  other reason than, in the end, it's good for their own personal health  and survival.   No matter how experienced, no matter how proficient , a trapeze  artist will not attempt a totally new death-defying  leap without first  trying it with a net below him. And depending on ho w death-  defying the trick is, he may insist on always havin g a net when per- forming the trick. Besides its obvious advantage of  catching you if  you fall, the net also provides a psychological ben efit. Knowing it is  there gives the trapeze artist the confidence to tr y something he's  never done before, or to do it again and again. Rem ove the net and  he will only do the safe tricks, the ones he knows he can land. The  more he trusts the quality of the net, the more he will take personal  risks to make his act better. The trust the circus management gives  him by providing him a net is probably afforded to other performers  too. Soon all the performers will feel confident to  try new things and  push themselves further. That collection of persona l confidence and  personal risk results in the entire circus putting on a much better  show. An overall better show means more customers. And the  system thrives. But not without trust. For those wi thin a community,  or an organization, they must trust that their lead ers provide a net— practical or emotional. With that feeling of suppor t, those in the  ======================================== [Página 121] ======================================== THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST  115 organization are more likely to put in extra effort  that ultimately  benefits the group as a whole.   I will admit that there are always those who will t ake the risk, for  the first time or repeatedly, without the net. Ther e will always be  those who will explore regardless of who is home ho lding down the  fort. These people sometimes earn their rightful sp ots as the  innovators. The ones who pushed further, the ones w ho did things  no one else would do. Some of them may advance a bu siness or  even society. And some of them end up dead before t hey achieve  anything.   There is big a difference between jumping out of a plane with a  parachute on and jumping without one. Both produce extraordinary  experiences, but only one increases the likelihood of being able to  try again another time. A trapeze artist with a per sonality  predisposed to taking extraordinary risks without a  net may be the  star attraction in an otherwise mediocre show. But if he dies or  leaves for another circus, then what? This is the p aradigm in which  someone is motivated by self-gain regardless of the  consequences or  the benefits to the organization for which he or sh e works. In such a  case, the effort may be good for the individual and  it may be good  for the group, but the benefits, especially for the  group, come with a  time limit. Over time, this system will break down,  often to the  detriment of the organization. Developing trust to encourage people  other than those with a predilection for risk, like  Nick Leeson, is a  better long-term strategy.   Great organizations become great because the people  inside the  organization feel protected. The strong sense of cu lture creates a  sense of belonging and acts like a net. People come  to work know- ing that their bosses, colleagues and the organizat ion as a whole  will look out for them. This results in reciprocal behavior. Indi- vidual decisions, efforts and behaviors that suppor t, benefit and  protect the long-term interest of the organization as a whole.   ======================================== [Página 122] ======================================== START WITH WHY  116 Southwest Airlines, a company renowned for its cust omer focus,  does not, as a matter of policy, believe the custom er is always right.  Southwest will not tolerate customers who abuse the ir staff. They  would rather those customers fly on a different air line. It's a subtle  irony that one of the best customer service compani es in the country  focuses on its employees before its customers. The trust between the  management and the employees, not dogma, is what pr oduces the  great customer service. It is a prerequisite, then,  for someone to  trust the culture in which they work to share the v alues and beliefs  of that culture. Without it, that employee, for exa mple, is simply a  bad fit and likely to work only for self-gain witho ut consideration  for the greater good. But if those inside the organ ization are a good  fit, the opportunity to "go the extra mile," to exp lore, to invent, to  innovate, to advance and, more importantly, to do s o again and  again and again, increases dramatically. Only with mutual trust can  an organization become great.   Real Trust Comes from the Things You Can't See   "Rambo 2," said the voice over Brigadier General Ju mper's radio,  referring to him by his call sign. "Your group 180,  twenty-five miles,  closing fast."   "Barnyard radar contact," replied Rambo 2, reportin g that he had  picked up the enemy group on his own radar. A one-s tar general,  John Jumper was an experienced F-15 pilot with thou sands of hours  of flight time and over a thousand combat hours. By  all measures,  he was one of the best. Born in Paris, Texas, he ha d enjoyed a  distinguished career. He'd flown just about everyth ing the U.S. Air  Force had, from cargo planes to fighter jets. Decor ated and  distinguished, the commander of his own combat wing , he was the  embodiment of what it meant to be a fighter pilot. Smart and  confident.   ======================================== [Página 123] ======================================== THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST  117 But on that day, Jumper's reaction didn't match the  situation he  faced. By twenty-five miles, he would have been exp ected to fire his  weapons or take some other offensive movement. Fear ing that  Jumper was locked onto the wrong contact on his rad ar, Captain  Lori Robinson calmly repeated what she could see fr om miles away:  "Rambo 2 confirm radar contact YOUR group now 190 t wenty  miles."   As the air weapons controller who was watching the action on  her radar screen from a nearby command-and-control center, it was  Lori Robinson's job to direct the pilot toward enem y aircraft so that  he could use his weapons to intercept and destroy t hem. Unlike an  air traffic controller, whose job it is to keep air  traffic apart, the  weapons controller has to bring the planes closer t ogether. From the  vantage point of the radar screen, only the weapons  controller has  the big picture, as the pilot's onboard navigation system shows only  what's directly in front of the aircraft.   Captain Robinson saw her job as something bigger, h owever,  than just staring at radar, something more profound  than just being  the eyes and ears for the pilots who were hurtling into harm's way  at 1,500 mph. Captain Robinson knew WHY her job was  important.  She saw herself as responsible for clearing a path for the pilots in  her care so that they could do what they needed to do, so they could  push themselves and their aircraft further with gre ater confidence.  And for this reason, she was unusually good at her job. Robinson  couldn't make mistakes. If she did, she would lose the trust of her  pilots and, worse, they would lose trust in themsel ves. You see, it's  confidence that makes fighter pilots so good at the ir jobs.   And then it happened. Captain Robinson could tell f rom the  calm of Jumper's voice over the radio that he was u naware of the  threat coming at him. On a cloudless day, 20,000 fe et over the desert,  the alarm screeched in Rambo 2's $25 million, state -of-the-art fighter  jet. He looked up from his radar screen and saw the  enemy  ======================================== [Página 124] ======================================== START WITH WHY  118 engaging him. "BREAK RIGHT! BREAK RIGHT!" he scream ed into  his radio. On October 9, 1988, Brigadier General Jo hn R Jumper was  killed.   Captain Robinson waited. There was an eerie calm. B efore too  long, Jumper stormed into the debriefing room at Ne llis Air Force  Base. "You got me killed!" he barked at Captain Rob inson. Situated  in the Nevada desert, Nellis is home to the Air For ce Fighter Weap- ons School, and on that day, General John Jumper to ok a direct hit  from a simulated missile from another U.S. Air Forc e jet playing the  part of an enemy combatant.   "Sir, it was not my fault," Captain Robinson replie d calmly.  "Check the video. You'll see." General Jumper, then  the 57th Wing  commander, a graduate of the USAF Fighter Weapons S chool, and a  former instructor at Nellis, routinely evaluated ev ery detail of every  training mission he flew. Pilots often relied on th e video to learn  from their exercises. The video didn't lie. And it didn't on that day  either. It revealed that the error was indeed his, not Captain  Robinson's. It was a classic blunder. He had forgot ten he was part of  a team. He had forgotten that what made him so good  at his job was  not just his ability. Jumper was one of the best be cause there were  others who were looking out for him. A massive infr astructure of  people he couldn't see.   Without question General Jumper had been given the best  equipment, the best technology and the best trainin g that money  could buy. But it was the mechanics, the teachers, his fellow pilots,  the culture of the Air Force and Captain Robinson w ho ensured that  he could trust himself to get the job done. General  Jumper forgot  WHY he was so good and made a split-second decision  that cost  him his life. But this is what training is for, to learn these lessons.   Some sixteen years after his lesson over the Nevada  desert,  General Jumper went on to big things. Now a retired  four-star  general, he served as chief of staff of the U.S. Ai r Force from 2001 to  ======================================== [Página 125] ======================================== THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST  119 2005, the highest-ranking uniformed office in the e ntire Air Force,  responsible for the organization, training and equi pping of nearly  700,000 active-duty, guard, reserve and civilian fo rces serving in the  United States and overseas. As a member of the Join t Chiefs of Staff,  he, along with the other service chiefs, advised th e secretary of  defense, the National Security Council and the pres ident.   This is not, however, a story about General Jumper.  It is a story  about Lori Robinson. Now herself a brigadier genera l in the Air  Force, she no longer has her face down a scope. The re are no more  bogeys and bandits, the Air Force's nicknames for t he good guys  and the bad guys, in her life. Even though her job has changed,   General Robinson still starts every day by remindin g herself WHY  she came to work.   As much as she misses "her kids," as she called tho se who served  under her command, General Robinson is still lookin g for ways she  can clear a path for others so that they can push t hemselves and the  organization further. "The time to think of yoursel f is done, it is not  about you, it is about the lieutenants behind you,"  she'd remind her  students when she was an instructor at the Fighter Weapons School.  "If enough of us do this," she goes on, referring t o WHY she does  what she does, "then we leave this military and thi s country in better  shape than we found it. And isn't that the point?" And it is that sense  of purpose, a clear idea of WHY she comes to work, that has been  the cornerstone of General Robinson's success. And that,  incidentally, has been remarkable.   Working hard to clear a path for others so that the y can confi- dently go on to do bigger and better things has in turn inspired  others to clear a path for General Robinson to do e xactly the same  thing. As a woman in the very masculine world of th e military, she  sets an example for how to lead. Great leadership i s not about flex- ing and intimidation; great leaders, as General Rob inson proves,  ======================================== [Página 126] ======================================== START WITH WHY  120 lead with WHY. They embody a sense of purpose that inspires those  around them.   General Robinson was so trusted as a weapons contro ller that it  was not unusual for pilots in training to request t hat she be assigned  to them. "The greatest compliment I ever got was wh en people  would say, 'When I go to war, I want Lori on the ra dio,'" she says.  She is the first woman in the history of the Air Fo rce to command  the 552nd Air Control Wing out of Tinker Air Force Base, one of the  largest wings in Air Combat Command (the wing that flies the  AWACS airborne control aircraft—the fleet of Boeing  707s with the  huge rotating radar dishes on top). She is the firs t commander of a  combat wing ever who didn't come up through the pil ot ranks. She  was the first female Weapons School instructor to t each at the Air  Force Fighter Weapons School, where the Air Force t rains all its top  guns. There, she became the most celebrated teacher  in the ranks— winning best teacher seven classes in a row. She is  the first female  director of the Secretary of the Air Force and Chie f of Staff of the Air  Force Executive Action Group. In 2000, the chairman  of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff said of General Robinson, at the ti me still a captain,  that she singularly influenced his ideas on airpowe r. And the list  goes on.   By any measure, General Lori Robinson is a remarkab le leader.  Some in management positions operate as if they are  in a tree of  monkeys. They make sure that everyone at the top of  the tree look- ing down sees only smiles. But all too often, those  at the bottom  looking up see only asses. Great leaders like Gener al Robinson are  respected by those both above and below. Those in h er command  trust her implicitly because they know she's commit ted to looking  after them. "There's nothing you can do that I can' t fix," she was  often heard telling students at Fighter Weapons Sch ool. And those  to whom she reports show remarkable deference to he r. "I don't  know how she gets away with half the stuff she does ," say those  ======================================== [Página 127] ======================================== THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST  121 who know her. More importantly, it is said with a g rin and with  respect. General Robinson's ability to lead develop ed not because  she's the smartest or the nicest. She's a great lea der because she  understands that earning the trust of an organizati on doesn't come  from setting out to impress everyone, it comes from  setting out to  serve those who serve her. It is the invisible trus t that gives a leader  the following they need to get things done. And in Lori Robinson's  case, things get done.   I use the military because it exaggerates the point . Trust matters.  Trust comes from being a part of a culture or organ ization with a  common set of values and beliefs. Trust is maintain ed when the val- ues and beliefs are actively managed. If companies do not actively  work to keep their Golden Circle in balance—clarity , discipline and  consistency—then trust starts to break down. A comp any, indeed  any organization, must work actively to remind ever yone WHY the  company exists. WHY it was founded in the first pla ce. What it  believes. They need to hold everyone in the company  accountable to  the values and guiding principles. It's not enough to just write them  on the wall—that's passive. Bonuses and incentives must revolve  around them. The company must serve those whom they  wish to  serve it.   With balance, those who are good fits can trust tha t everyone is  on board for the same reasons. It's also the only w ay that each  individual in the system can trust that others are acting to "leave the  organization in a better way than we found it," to quote General  Robinson again. This is the root of passion. Passio n comes from  feeling like you are a part of something that you b elieve in, some- thing bigger than yourself. If people do not trust that a company is  organized to advance the WHY, then the passion is d iluted. Without  managed trust, people will show up to do their jobs  and they will  worry primarily about themselves. This is the root of office  politics—people acting within the system for self-g ain often at the  ======================================== [Página 128] ======================================== START WITH WHY  122 expense of others, even the company. If a company d oesn't manage  trust, then those working for it will not trust the  company, and self- interest becomes the overwhelming motivation. This may be good  for the short term, but over time the organization will get weaker  and weaker.   Herb Kelleher, the visionary behind Southwest Airli nes, under- stood this better than most. He recognized that to get the best out  his employees he needed to create an environment in  which they felt  like the company cared about them. He knew that the y would  naturally excel if they felt the work they did made  a difference.  When a journalist asked Kelleher who comes first to  him, his share- holders or his employees, his response was heresy a t the time (and  to a large degree still is). "Well, that's easy," h e said, "employees  come first and if employees are treated right, they  treat the outside  world right, the outside world uses the company's p roduct again,  and that makes the shareholders happy. That really is the way that it  works and it's not a conundrum at all."    The influence of Others   Whom do you trust more, someone you know or someone  you  don't know? What do you trust more, a claim made in  a piece of  advertising or a recommendation from a friend? Whom  do you trust  more, the waiter who tells you, "Everything on the menu is great,"  or the waiter who tells you to avoid the chicken ca sserole? Are these  questions too easy? Then how about this one: why sh ould anyone  trust you?   Personal recommendations go a long way. We trust th e judg- ment of others. It's part of the fabric of strong c ultures. But we don't  trust the judgment of just anyone. We are more like ly to trust those  who share our values and beliefs. When we believe s omeone has  our best interest in mind because it is in their be nefit to do so, the  whole group benefits. The advancements of societies  were based a  ======================================== [Página 129] ======================================== THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST  123 great deal on the trust between those with a common  set of values  and beliefs.   The feeling of trust is lodged squarely in the same  place as the  WHY—the limbic brain—and it's often powerful enough  to trump  empirical research, or at least seed doubt. This is  the reason why so  many manipulations are effective; we believe that, for better or  worse, others know more than we do. Clearly, four o ut of five den- tists know more than us when choosing chewing gum ( but what  about the one holdout . . . what did he know that t he others didn't?).  Of course we trust the celebrity endorsement. Those  celebs are rich  and can use any product they want. It must be good if they are  putting their reputation on the line to promote it,  right?   You probably answered that question in your head al ready.  Clearly they are endorsing the product because they  are getting  paid to. But if celebrity endorsements didn't work,  companies  wouldn't use them. Or perhaps it's the fear that th ey "might" work  that fuels the million-dollar wink and a smile that  encourages us to  choose one car over another or one lipstick over an other. The fact is,  none of us is immune to the effect of someone we kn ow or  feel like  we trust influencing our decisions.   Celebrity endorsements are used with this concept i n mind. By  using a recognizable face or name, so the assumptio n goes, people  will more likely trust the claims being made. The f law in this  assumption is that celebrity status alone may work to influence  behavior, but at this level it's just peer pressure . For it to work, the  celebrity needs to represent some clear cause or be lief. An athlete  known for her work ethic may have some value to a c ompany with  the same belief, for example. Or an actor known for  his charitable  work would be good fit for a company known for doin g good. In  these cases, it is clear that both the company and the celebrity are  working together to advance the same cause. I recen tly saw an ad  for TD Ameritrade that featured morning show hosts Regis Philbin  ======================================== [Página 130] ======================================== START WITH WHY  124 and Kelly Ripa. I'm still trying to figure out the cause that two talk  show hosts represent and how that matters when it c omes to  choosing one bank over another. When a company says  that a  celebrity represents "the kind of qualities we want  our customers to  associate with us," they miss the point. The celebr ity is another  WHAT to the company's WHY. The celebrity must embod y the  qualities that already exist at the company. Withou t clarity of WHY  first, any benefit will amount to simply increasing  recognition.   So many decisions (and indeed contract negotiations ) are based  on an advertising industry measurement called a Q-s core—a  quotient of how well recognized a celebrity is, how  famous they are,  so to speak. The higher the score, the better the u naided awareness  of the celebrity. This information alone is not eno ugh. The clearer  the spokesperson's own WHY is understood, the bette r ambassador  they can be for a like-minded brand or company. But  there is no  measurement of a celebrity's WHY currently availabl e, so the result  is obvious. The value of too many celebrity endorse ments is the  celebrity appeal alone. Unless the audience to whic h you are trying  to appeal gets a sense of what that spokesperson be lieves, unless  that spokesperson is "one of us," the enforcement m ay drive recog- nition, it may even drive sales for the short term,  but it will fail to  build trust.   A trusted recommendation is powerful enough to trum p facts  and figures and even multimillion-dollar marketing budgets. Think  of the young father who wants to do everything righ t for his new- born child. He decides he's going to get a new car— something safe,  something to protect his child. He spends a week re ading all the  magazines and reports, he's seen all the advertisin g and decides that  on Saturday he's buying a Volvo. The facts are in a nd his mind is  made up. Friday night he and his wife head to a din ner party.  Standing by the punch bowl is their friend the loca l car enthusiast.  Our intrepid new father walks up to his friend and proudly  ======================================== [Página 131] ======================================== THE EMERGENCE OF TRUST  125 announces that, as a new father, he's decided to bu y a Volvo. With- out a thought his friend replies, "Why would you do  that? Mercedes  is the safest car on the road. If you care about yo ur kid, you'll get a  Mercedes."   Playing on his desires to be a good father, but als o trusting his  friend's opinion, one of three things will happen. Our young father  will either change his mind and buy a Mercedes; he will go forward  with his original decision, but not without some do ubt about  whether he's indeed doing the right thing; or he wi ll go back to the  drawing board to redo all his research in order to reassure himself  of his decision. No matter how much rational inform ation he has at  his fingertips, unless that decision also feels rig ht, stress will go up  and confidence will go down. However you slice it, the opinions of  others matter. And the opinions of those we trust m atter most.   The question isn't how should car companies talk to  the father  who bought the car. The question isn't even how the y court the  highly influential opinion of his friend, the car g uy. The concept of  buyer and influencers isn't a new one. The question  is, how do you  get enough of the influencers to talk about you so that you can make  the system tip?    ======================================== [Página 132] ========================================   126  ======================================== [Página 133] ========================================   127 7    HOW A TIPPING POINT TIPS   If I told you I knew of a company that invented an amazing new  technology that will change the way we consume TV, would that  pique your interest? Perhaps you'd be interested in  buying their  product or investing in their company. It gets bett er. They have the  single best product available. Their quality is thr ough the roof, way  better than anything else on the market. And their PR efforts have so  been remarkable, they've even become a household na me.  Interested?   This is the case of TiVo. A company that seemed to have every- thing going for them but turned out to be a commerc ial and finan- cial failure. Since they seemed to have the recipe for success, TiVo's  flop defied conventional wisdom. Their struggles, h owever, are eas- ily understood if you consider that they thought WH AT they did  ======================================== [Página 134] ======================================== START WITH WHY  128 mattered more than WHY. They also ignored the Law o f Diffusion  of Innovations.   In 2000, Malcolm Gladwell created his own tipping p oint when  he shared with us how tipping points happen in busi ness and in so- ciety. In his aptly named book  The Tipping Point,  Gladwell identifies  groups of necessary populations he calls connectors  and influencers.  With little doubt Gladwell's ideas are spot-on. But  it still begs the  question, why should an influencer tell anyone abou t you?  Marketers are always trying to influence the influe ncers, but few  really know how. We can't dispute that tipping poin ts happen and  the conditions that Gladwell articulates are right,  but can a tipping  point happen intentionally? They can't just be an a ccidental  phenomenon. If they exist, then we should be able t o design one,  and if we can design one, we should be able to desi gn one that lasts  beyond the initial tip. It's the difference between  a fad and an idea  that changes an industry or society forever.   In his 1962 book  Diffusion of Innovations,  Everett M. Rogers was  the first to formally describe how innovations spre ad through so- ciety. Thirty years later, in his book  Crossing the Chasm,  Geoffrey  Moore expanded on Rogers's ideas to apply the princ iple to high- tech product marketing. But the Law of Diffusion of  Innovations  explains much more than just the spread of innovati on or technol- ogy. It explains the spread of ideas.   If you don't know the law, you're likely already fa miliar with  some of its terminology. Our population is broken i nto five seg- ments that fall across a bell curve: innovators, ea rly adoptors, early  majority, late majority and laggards.   ======================================== [Página 135] ======================================== HOW A TIPPING POINT TIPS  129   As the law states, the first 2.5 percent of the pop ulation are the  innovators, and the next 13.5 percent are early ado pters. Innovators,  Moore says, pursue new products or ideas aggressive ly and are  intrigued by any fundamental advance; being first i s a central part  of their lives. As their name suggests, innovators are the small per- centage of the population that challenges the rest of us to see and !  think of the world a little differently.   Early adopters are similar to innovators in that th ey appreciate  the advantages wrought by new ideas or technologies . They are  early to recognize the value of new ideas and are q uite willing to  put up with imperfection because they can see the p otential. Al- though quick to see the potential and willing to ta ke risks to try new  technologies or ideas, early adopters are not idea generators like the  innovators. But both groups are similar, as Moore s ays, in that they  rely heavily on their intuition. They trust their g ut.   Early adopters, like innovators but to a lesser deg ree, are willing  to pay a premium or suffer some level of inconvenie nce to own a  product or espouse an idea that feels right. Those on the left side of  the diffusion curve are the ones who stood in line for six hours to be  among the first to buy the iPhone, Apple's entry in to the mobile  phone market, even though they could have walked in to a store a  week later and bought one without waiting. Their wi llingness to  suffer an inconvenience or pay a premium had less t o do with how    ======================================== [Página 136] ======================================== START WITH WHY  130 great the product was and more to do with their own  sense of who  they are. They wanted to be the first.   These are also the personality types who bought fla t-screen TVs  when they first came out even though they cost upwa rds of $40,000  and the technology was still far from perfect. My f riend Nathan fits  this profile. I walked around his house once and co unted no fewer  than twelve Bluetooth earpieces for his mobile phon e lying around  his house. I asked him why he had so many. "Did the y all break?" I  queried. "No," he replied, "they came out with a ne w one." (There  were also about five laptops, various models of Bla ckBerry smart  phones and boxes of other gadgets lying about that never quite  worked that well.) Nathan is an early adopter.   The next 34 percent of the population are the early  majority, fol- lowed by the late majority, and finally the laggard s on the far right  side of the spectrum. Laggards are the ones who buy  touchtone  phones only because they don't make rotary phones a nymore. The  early and late majority are more practical-minded. For them,  rational factors matter more. The early majority is  slightly more  comfortable with new ideas or technologies, while t he late majority  is not.   The farther right you go on the curve, the more you  will en- counter the clients and customers who may need what  you have,  but don't necessarily believe what you believe. As clients, they are  the ones for whom, no matter how hard you work, it' s never  enough. Everything usually boils down to price with  them. They are  rarely loyal. They rarely give referrals and someti mes you may even  wonder out loud why you still do business with them . "They just  don't get it," our gut tells us. The importance of identifying this  group is so that you can avoid doing business with them. Why  invest good money and energy to go after people who , at the end of  the day, will do business with you anyway if you me et their  practical requirements but will never be loyal if y ou don't? It's not  ======================================== [Página 137] ======================================== HOW A TIPPING POINT TIPS  131 too hard to recognize where people fall on the spec trum once you're  in a relationship with them; the opportunity is to figure out which is  which before you decide to work with them.   We all sit at different places on this spectrum dep ending on the  product or idea. Most of us are fiercely loyal to c ertain products and  ideas at various times and demonstrate left-side-of -the-curve  behavior. And for other products or ideas we exhibi t right-side-of-  the-curve behavior. When we sit on one side of the spectrum, we  often have a hard time understanding those on the o ther side be- cause their behavior doesn't make sense to us. My s ister is an early  adopter when it comes to fashion trends, whereas I' m firmly in the  late majority. It was only recently that I finally caved and bought a  pair of overpriced designer blue jeans. I admit the y look good, but I  still think they aren't worth the money and I can't  understand why  my sister thinks they are.   In contrast, I'm an early adopter for some technolo gies. I bought  a Blue-ray DVD player before they had perfected the  technology. I  paid about four or five times more for it compared to a regular DVD  player. My sister can't understand why I waste my m oney on all  that "useless stuff," as she puts it. We will never  see eye to eye on  this stuff.   Each of us assigns different values to different th ings and our  behaviors follow accordingly. This is one of the ma jor reasons why  it is nearly impossible to "convince" someone of th e value of your  products or ideas based on rational arguments and t angible bene- fits. It's the old Ferrari and Honda Odyssey debate  again. Designer  jean companies (or my sister) can talk to me until they are blue in  the face about the importance of fabric quality, de sign and  workmanship—it goes in one ear and out the other. S imilarly, it can  be proven, beyond a shadow of doubt, the rational b enefits of  choosing a $500 DVD player over a $100 one; my sist er won't hear a  word of it. And so the game of manipulation ensues.  Again, al- ======================================== [Página 138] ======================================== START WITH WHY  132 though always effective, manipulations don't breed loyalty and they  increase costs and stress for all parties involved.   Most people or organizations that have something to  sell, be it a  product, service or idea, hope to achieve some leve l of mass- market  success or acceptance. Most hope to penetrate the b ell of the curve.  Getting there, however, is easier said than done. W hen you ask  small businesses about their goals, many of them wi ll tell you they  want to be a billion-dollar business in X number of  years. The odds  of that happening, unfortunately, don't look good. Of the 27 million  businesses registered in the United States, fewer t han 2,000 ever  reach a billion dollars in annual revenues. And 99. 9 percent of all  businesses in America have fewer than 500 employees . In other  words, mass-market success is really hard to achiev e.   Big companies have similar challenges repeating the ir mass-  market success. Just because they've done it once o r twice doesn't  mean they know how to do it every time. The Zune, M icrosoft's  entry into the multigigabyte mp3 player market, for  example, was  pegged to "take on the iPod." It didn't happen. Eve n if the quality is  superior, there is more to succeeding than just the  product and the  marketing. Don't forget, the superior Betamax techn ology did not  beat out the substandard VHS technology as the stan dard format for  videotape in the 1980s. The best does not always wi n. Like any  natural law, the Law of Diffusion must be considere d if mass-  market acceptance is important to you. Refusal to d o so will cost a  lot of money and may result in a mediocre success, if not complete  failure.   There is an irony to mass-market success, as it tur ns out. It's near  impossible to achieve if you point your marketing a nd resources to  the middle of the bell, if you attempt to woo those  who represent  the middle of the curve without first appealing to the early adopters.  It can be done, but at massive expense. This is bec ause the early  majority, according to Rogers, will not try somethi ng until someone  ======================================== [Página 139] ======================================== HOW A TIPPING POINT TIPS  133 else has tried it first. The early majority, indeed  the entire majority,  need the recommendation of someone else who has alr eady  sampled the product or service. They need to know  someone  else has  tested it. They need that trusted, personal recomme ndation.   According to the Law of Diffusion, mass-market succ ess can only  be achieved after you penetrate between 15 percent to 18 percent of  the market. That's because the early majority won't  try something  new until someone else has tried it first. This is why we have to  drop our price or offer value-added services. We're  attempting to  reduce the risk tolerance of these practical-minded  people until they  feel comfortable to buy. That's what a manipulation  is. They may  buy, but they won't be loyal. Don't forget, loyalty  is when people are  willing to suffer some inconvenience or pay a premi um to do  business with you. They may even turn down a better  offer from  someone else—something the late majority rarely doe s. The ability  to get the system to tip is the point at which the growth of a business  or the spreading of an idea starts to move at an ex traordinary pace.  It is also at this point that a product gains mass- market acceptance.  The point at which an idea becomes a movement. When  that  happens, the growth is not only exponential, it is automatic. It just  goes.   The goal of business then should not be to simply s ell to anyone  who wants what you have—the majority—but rather to find people  who believe what you believe, the left side of the bell curve. They  perceive greater value in what you do and will happ ily pay a  premium or suffer some sort of inconvenience to be a part of your  cause. They are the ones who, on their own volition , will tell others  about you. That 15 to 18 percent is not made up of people who are  simply willing to buy the product. It is the percen tage of people  who share your beliefs and want to incorporate your  ideas, your  products and your services into their own lives as WHATs to their  own WHYs. They look to WHAT you do as a tangible el ement that  ======================================== [Página 140] ======================================== START WITH WHY  134 demonstrates their own purpose, cause or belief to the outside  world. Their willingness to pay a premium or suffer  inconvenience  to use your product or service says more about them  than it does  about you and your products. Their ability to easil y see WHY they  need to incorporate your products into their lives makes this group  the most loyal customers. They are also the most lo yal shareholders  and the most loyal employees. No matter where they sit in the spec- trum, these are the people who not only love you bu t talk about  you. Get enough of the people on the left side of t he curve on your  side and they encourage the rest to follow.   I love asking businesses what their conversion is o n new busi- ness efforts. Many answer proudly, "Ten percent." E ven if you ig- nore the principles of The Golden Circle, the law o f averages says  you can win about 10 percent of the business. Throw  enough spa- ghetti against the wall and some of it sticks. To g row the business,  all you need to do is more prospecting, which is wh y growing your  business by aiming at the middle of the curve is so  expensive.  Though the business may grow, the average will stay  about the  same, and 10 percent is not enough for the system t o tip.   Likewise, 10 percent of your existing customers or clients will  naturally show loyalty to you. But why are they so loyal? Like our  inability to explain why we love our spouses, the b est we can mus- ter up to explain what makes them such great client s is, "They just  get it." And though this explanation may feel right , it is completely  unactionable. How do you get more people to "get it "? This is what  Moore refers to as the "chasm," the transition betw een the early  adopters and the early majority, and it's hard to c ross. But not if you  know WHY.   If you have the discipline to focus on the early ad opters, the majority  will come along eventually. But it must start with WHY. Simply  focusing on so-called influencers is not enough. Th e challenge is,  which influencers? There are those who seem to fit the influencer  ======================================== [Página 141] ======================================== HOW A TIPPING POINT TIPS  135 profile more than others, but in reality we are all  influencers at  different times for different reasons. You don't ju st want any  influencer, you want someone who believes what you believe. Only  then will they talk about you without any prompts o r incentives. If  they truly believe in what you believe and if they are truly on the  left side of the curve they won't need to be incent ivized; they'll do it  because they want to. The entire act of incentivizi ng an influencer is  manipulative. It renders the influencer completely inauthentic to his  or her group. It won't take long for the group to f ind out that a  recommendation wasn't made with the group's best in terest in  mind, but rather because of one person's self-inter est. Trust erodes  and the value of the influencer is rendered useless .   Refusing to Consider the Law of Diffusion Will Cost  You   In 1997, TiVo was racing to market with a remarkabl e new device.  Few would debate that from the time the product was  introduced to  the present day, TiVo has had the single highest-qu ality product in  its category. The company's PR has been extraordina ry. They have  achieved an unaided awareness that most brands can only dream of.  They have become more than generic terms, like Klee nex, Band-Aids  and Q-tips. In fact, they have been able to achieve  more than generic  status; they are a verb in the English language, "t o TiVo."   They were well funded with venture capital and had a tech- nology that could truly reinvent how we consume tel evision. The  problem was, they marketed their technology directl y to the middle  of the bell curve. Seeing the mass-market appeal of  the product, they  ignored the principles of the Law of Diffusion and targeted the  masses. Compounding that bad aim, they attempted to  appeal to the  cynical majority by explaining WHAT the product did  instead of  stating WHY the company or the product existed in t he first place.  They attempted to convince with features and benefi ts.   They basically said to the mass market:   ======================================== [Página 142] ======================================== START WITH WHY  136 We've got a new product.   It pauses live TV.   Skips commercials.   Rewinds live TV.   Memorizes your viewing habits and records shows on your  behalf without your needing to set it.   Analysts were intrigued by the prospects of TiVo as  well as its  competitor, Replay, a well-funded start-up backed b y venture cap- ital. One market researcher estimated that these so -called personal  TV receivers would reach 760,000 subscribers by the  end of the first  year.   TiVo finally shipped in 1999. Mike Ramsay and Jim B arton, two  former colleagues who had founded TiVo, were certai n the TV-  viewing public was ready. And they may have been if  only TiVo  knew how to talk to them. But despite the excitemen t among ana- lysts and technophiles, sales were hugely disappoin ting. TiVo sold  about 48,000 units the first year. Meanwhile, Repla y, whose backers  included the founders of Netscape, failed to gain a  following and  instead became embroiled in a dispute with the tele vision networks  over the way it allowed viewers to skip ads. In 200 0, the company  adopted a new strategy and a few months later was s old to  SonicBlue, which later filed for bankruptcy.   Analysts were stumped as to why the TiVo machines w eren't  selling better. The company seemed to have everythi ng going for it.  After all, they had the recipe for success: a great -quality product,  money and ideal market conditions. In 2002, after T iVo had been on  the market nearly three years, a headline in  Advertising Age summed  it up best: "More U.S. Homes Have Outhouses than Ti Vos." (At the  time, there were 671,000 homes with outhouses in th e United States,  compared with 504,000 to 514,000 homes with TiVo.) Not only were  sales poor, but the company has not fared well for its shareholders  either. At the time of the initial public offering in the fall of 1999,  ======================================== [Página 143] ======================================== HOW A TIPPING POINT TIPS  137 TiVo stock traded at slightly over $40 per share. A  few months later  it hit its high at just over $50. The stock decline d steadily for the rest  of the year, and except for three short periods sin ce 2001, it has  never since traded over $10.   If you apply the principles of The Golden Circle, t he answer is  clear—people don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY yo u do it,  and TiVo attempted to convince consumers to buy by telling them  only WHAT the product did. Features and rational be nefits. The  practical-minded, technophobic mass market's respon se was  predictable. "I don't understand it. I don't need i t. I don't like it.  You're scaring me." There were a small number of Ti Vo loyalists,  probably about 10 percent, those who just "got it,"  who didn't need  an explicit articulation of WHY. They exist to this  day, but there  were not enough of them to create the tipping point  that TiVo  needed and predicted.   What TiVo should have done is talked about what the y believed.  They should have talked about WHY the product was i nvented in  the first place, and then ventured out to share the ir invention with  the innovators and early adopters who believed what  they believed.  If they had started their sales pitch with WHY the product existed in  the first place, the product itself would have beco me the proof of the  higher cause—proof of WHY. If their Golden Circle w as in balance,  the outcome might have been quite different. Compar e the original  list of features and benefits with a revised versio n that starts with  WHY:   If you're the kind of person who likes to have tota l control of every  aspect of your life, boy do we have a product for y ou.   It pauses live TV.   Skips commercials.   Rewinds live TV.   ======================================== [Página 144] ======================================== START WITH WHY  138 Memorizes your viewing habits and records shows on your behalf  without you needing to set it.     In this version, all the features and rational bene fits serve as  tangible proof of WHY the product exists in the fir st place, not the  reasons to buy, per se. The WHY is the belief that drives the  decision, and WHAT it does provides us a way to rat ionalize the  appeal of the product.   Confirming their failure to tap the right segment o f the market,  TiVo offered a very rational explanation of what wa s happening.  "Until people get their hands on it," Rebecca Baer,  a spokeswoman  for TiVo, told the  New York Times  in 2000, "they don't understand  why they need this." If this line of logic was true , then no new  technology would ever take hold. A fact that is pat ently untrue.  Though Ms. Baer was correct about the mass market's  failure to  understand the value, it was TiVo's failure to prop erly communicate  and rally the left side of the bell curve to educat e and encourage the  adoption that was the reason so few people "got the ir hands on it."  TiVo did not start with WHY. They ignored the left side of the curve  and completely failed to find the tipping point. An d for those  reasons, "people didn't get their hands on it," and  the mass market  didn't buy it.   Fast-forward almost a decade. TiVo continues to hav e the best  digital video-recording product on the market. Its unaided aware- ness continues to be through the roof. Nearly every one knows now  what the product is and what it does, yet the compa ny's future is by  no means secure.   While millions of viewers may say they "TiVo" thing s all the  time, unfortunately for TiVo, they aren't using a T iVo system.  Rather, they "TiVo" shows using a digital video rec order provided  by the cable or satellite company. Many try to make  the argument  that TiVo's failure was due to the cable companies'  superior  ======================================== [Página 145] ======================================== HOW A TIPPING POINT TIPS  139 distribution. But we know that people often go out of their way, pay  a premium or suffer an inconvenience to buy a produ ct that  resonates on a visceral level with them. Until rece ntly, people who  wanted a custom Harley-Davidson motorcycle waited u pwards of  six months to a year to take delivery of their prod uct. By any  standard, that's just bad service. Consumers could have just walked  into a Kawasaki dealership and walked right out wit h a brand-new  bike. They could have found a very similar model wi th similar  power and maybe even for less money. But they suffe red the  inconvenience willingly, not because they were in t he market for a  motorcycle, but because they wanted a Harley.   TiVo is not the first to ignore these sound princip les and won't be  the last. The meager success of satellite radio tec hnology like Sirius  or XM Radio has followed a similar path. They offer ed a well- publicized, well-funded new technology that attempt ed to convince  users with a promise of rational features and benef its—no  commercials and more channels than the competition.  Throw in an  impressive array of celebrity endorsements, includi ng rap star  Snoop Dog and 1970s pop icon David Bowie, and the t echnology  still didn't stick. When you start with WHY, those who believe what  you believe are drawn to you for very personal reas ons. It is those  who share your values and beliefs, not the quality of your products,  that will cause the system to tip. Your role in the  process is to be  crystal clear about what purpose, cause or belief y ou exist to cham- pion, and to show how your products and services he lp advance  that cause. Absent a WHY, new ideas and technologie s quickly find  themselves playing the price-and-feature game—a sur e sign of an  absence of WHY and a slide into commodity status. I t is not the  technology that failed, it was how the companies tr ied to sell it.  Satellite radio has not displaced commercial radio in any meaning- ful way. Even when Sirius and XM merged, hoping the  joined force  of their companies would help change their luck, sh ares for the  ======================================== [Página 146] ======================================== START WITH WHY  140 combined company sold for less than 50 cents apiece . And, last time  I checked, XM was offering a discount, a promotion,  free shipping  and a claim of being "America's #1 satellite radio service with over  170 channels" to push their product.   Give the People Something to Believe In   On August 28, 1963, 250,000 people from across the country de- scended on the Mall in Washington, D.C., to hear Dr . Martin Luther  King Jr. give his famous "I Have a Dream" speech. T he organizers  didn't send out 250,000 invitations and there was n o  Web site to  check the date. How did they get a quarter of a mil lion people to  show up on the right day at the right time?   During the early 1960s, the country was torn apart by racial  tensions. There were riots in dozens of cities in 1 963 alone. America  was a country scarred by inequality and segregation . How the civil  rights movement lifted an idea that all men are cre ated equal to  become a movement with the power to change a countr y is  grounded in the principles of The Golden Circle and  the Law of  Diffusion.   Dr. King was not the only person alive during that time who  knew WHAT had to change to bring about civil rights  in America.  He had many ideas about WHAT needed to happen, but so did  others. And not all of his ideas were good. He was not a perfect  man; he had his complexities.   But Dr. King was absolute in his conviction. He  knew  change had  to happen in America. His clarity of WHY, his sense  of purpose,  gave him the strength and energy to continue his fi ght against often  seemingly insurmountable odds. There were others li ke him who  shared his vision of America, but many of them gave  up after too  many defeats. Defeat is painful. And the ability to  continue head-on,  day after day, takes something more than knowing wh at legislation  needs to be passed. For civil rights to truly take hold in the country,  ======================================== [Página 147] ======================================== HOW A TIPPING POINT TIPS  141 its organizers had to rally everyone. They may have  been able to  pass legislation, but they needed more than that, t hey needed to  change a country. Only if they could rally a nation  to join the cause,  not because they had to, but because they wanted to , could any  significant change endure. But no one person can ef fect lasting  change alone. It would take others who believed wha t King  believed.   The details of HOW to achieve civil rights or WHAT needed to  be done were debatable, and different groups tried different strate- gies. Violence was employed by some, appeasement by  others. Re- gardless of HOW or WHAT was being done, there was o ne thing  everyone had in common—WHY they were doing it. It w as not just  Martin Luther King's unflappable conviction that wa s able to stir a  population, but his ability to put his WHY into wor ds. Dr. King had  a gift. He talked about what he believed. And his w ords had the  power to inspire:   "I believe."   "I believe."   "I believe."   "There are two types of laws," he shared, "those th at are just and  those that are unjust. A just law," Dr. King expoun ded, "is a man-  made code that squares with the moral law. An unjus t law is a code  that is out of harmony with the moral law.... Any l aw that uplifts the  human personality is just. Any law that degrades hu man per- sonality is unjust. All segregation statutes are un just because segre- gation distorts the soul and damages the personalit y." His belief was  bigger than the civil rights movement. It was about  all of mankind  and how we treat each other. Of course, his WHY dev eloped as a  result of the time and place in which he was born a nd the color of  his skin, but the civil rights movement served as t he ideal platform  for Dr. King to bring his WHY, his belief in equali ty, to life.   ======================================== [Página 148] ======================================== START WITH WHY  142 People heard his beliefs and his words touched them  deep in- side. Those who believed what he believed took that  cause and  made it their own. And they told people what they b elieved. And  those people told others what they believed. Some o rganized to get  that belief out more efficiently.   And in the summer of 1963, a quarter of a million p eople showed  up to hear Dr. King deliver his "I Have a Dream" sp eech on the steps  of the Lincoln Memorial.   But how many people showed up for Dr. King?   Zero.   They showed up for themselves. It was what  they  believed. It was  what  they  saw as an opportunity to help America become a bet ter  version of itself. It was  they  who wanted to live in a country that  reflected their own values and beliefs that inspire d them to get on a  bus to travel for eight hours to stand in the Washi ngton sun in the  middle of August to hear Dr. King speak. Being in W ashington was  simply one of the things they did to prove what the y believed.  Showing up that day was one of the WHATs to their o wn WHY.  This was a cause and it was their cause.   Dr. King's speech itself served as a visceral remin der of the belief  shared by everyone who stood there listening. And t hat speech was  about what he believed, not how they were going to do it. He gave  the "I Have a Dream" speech, not the "I Have a Plan " speech. It was  a statement of purpose and not a comprehensive twel ve- point plan  to achieving civil rights in America. Dr. King offe red America a  place to go, not a plan to follow. The plan had its  place, but not on  the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.   Dr. King's articulation of his belief was something  powerful  enough to rally those who shared that belief even i f they weren't  personally affected by the inequalities. Nearly a q uarter of the peo- ple who came to the rally that day were white. This  was a belief not  about black America, this was a belief about a shar ed America. Dr.  ======================================== [Página 149] ======================================== HOW A TIPPING POINT TIPS  143 King was the leader of a cause. A cause for all tho se who believed  what he believed regardless of skin color.   It wasn't the details of his plans that earned him the right to lead.  It was what he believed and his ability to communic ate it clearly  that people followed. In essence, he, like all grea t leaders, became  the symbol of the belief. Dr. King came to personif y the cause. To  this day we build statues of him to keep that belie f alive and  tangible. People followed him not because of his id ea of a changed  America. People followed him because of  their  idea of a changed  America. The part of the brain that influences our behavior and  decisions does not have the capacity for language. We have trouble  saying clearly, in emotional terms, why we do what we do, and  offer rationalizations that, though valid and true,  are not powerful  enough to inspire others. So when asked why they sh owed up that  day, people pointed to Dr. King and said simply, "B ecause I  believe."   More than anything else, what Martin Luther King Jr . gave us  was clarity, a way to explain how we felt. He gave us the words that  inspired us. He gave us something to believe in, so mething we  could easily share with our friends. Everyone at th e Mall that day  shared a set of values and beliefs. And everyone th ere that day, re- gardless of skin color or race or sex, trusted each  other. It was that  trust, that common bond, that shared belief that fu eled a movement  that would change a nation.   We believed.   We believed.

Charisma Inspires.   RAH!!!! With a roar, Steve Ballmer, the man who rep laced Bill Gates  as CEO of Microsoft, bursts onto the stage of the c ompany's annual  global summit meeting. Ballmer loves Microsoft—he s ays so in no  uncertain words. He also knows how to pump up a cro wd. His  energy is almost folkloric. He pumps his fists and runs from one end  of the stage to the other, he screams and he sweats . He is remarkable  to watch and the crowd loves it. As Ballmer proves,  without a  doubt, energy can motivate a crowd. But can it insp ire a population?  What happens the next day or the next week when Bal lmer's energy  is not there to motivate his employees? Is energy e nough to keep a  company of about 80,000 people focused?   ======================================== [Página 154] ======================================== START WITH WHY  148 In contrast, Bill Gates is shy and awkward, a socia l misfit. He  does not fit the stereotype of the leader of a mult ibillion-dollar  corporation. He is not the most energetic public sp eaker. When Bill  Gates speaks, however, people listen with bated bre ath. They hang  on his every word. When Gates speaks, he doesn't ra lly a room, he  inspires it. Those who hear him take what he says a nd carry his  words with them for weeks, months or years. Gates d oesn't have  energy, but Bill Gates inspires.   Energy motivates but charisma inspires. Energy is e asy to see,  easy to measure and easy to copy Charisma is hard t o define, nearly  impossible to measure and too elusive to copy. All great leaders  have charisma because all great leaders have clarit y of WHY; and an  undying belief in a purpose or cause bigger than th emselves. It's not  Bill Gates's passion for computers that inspires us , it's his undying  optimism that even the most complicated problems ca n being  solved. He believes we can find ways to remove obst acles to ensure  that everyone can live and work to their greatest p otential. It is his 5  optimism to which we are drawn.   Living through the computer revolution, he saw the computer as  a perfect technology to help us all become more pro ductive and  achieve our greatest potential. That belief inspire d his vision of a, PC  on every desk to come to life. Ironic considering M icrosoft never  even made PCs. It wasn't just WHAT computers did th at; Gates saw  the impact for the new technology, it was WHY we ne eded them.  Today, the work he does with the Bill and Melinda G ates  Foundation has nothing to do with software, but it is another way he  has found to bring his WHY to life. He is looking f or ways to solve  problems. He still has an undying belief. And he st ill: believes that if  we can help people, this time those with less privi lege, remove some  seemingly simple obstacles, then they too will have  an opportunity  to be more productive and lift themselves up to ach ieve their great  ======================================== [Página 155] ======================================== STATUS BUT WHY, BUT KNOW HOW  149 potential. For Gates, all that has changed is WHAT he is doing to  bring his cause to life.   Charisma has nothing to do with energy; it comes fr om a clarity  of WHY. It comes from absolute conviction in an ide al bigger than  oneself. Energy, in contrast, comes from a good nig ht's sleep or lots  of caffeine. Energy can excite. But only charisma c an inspire.  Charisma commands loyalty. Energy does not.   Energy can always be injected into an organization to motivate  people to do things. Bonuses, promotions, other car rots and even a  few sticks can get people to work harder, for sure,  but the gains are,  like all manipulations, short-term. Over time, such  tactics cost more  money and increase stress for employee and employer  alike, and  eventually will become the main reason people show up for work  every day. That's not loyalty. That's the employee version of repeat  business. Loyalty among employees is when they turn  down more  money or benefits to continue working at the same c ompany.  Loyalty to a company trumps pay and benefits. And u nless you're  an astronaut, it's not the work we do that inspires  us either. It's the  cause we come to work for. We don't want to come to  work to build  a wall, we want to come to work to build a cathedra l.   The Chosen Path   Raised in Ohio, sixty miles from Dayton, Neil Armst rong grew up  on a healthy diet of stories about the Wright broth ers. From a very  early age he dreamed of flying. He'd make model air planes, read  magazines about flying and stare at the heavens thr ough a telescope  mounted on the roof of his house. He even got his p ilot's license  before he got his driver's license. With a childhoo d passion that  became reality, Armstrong was destined to become an  astronaut.  For the rest of us, however, our careers paths are more like Jeff  Sumpter's.   ======================================== [Página 156] ======================================== START WITH WHY  150 While Sumpter was in high school, his mother arrang ed for him  to get a summer internship at the bank where she wo rked. Four  years after he finished high school he called the b ank to see if he  could do some part-time work, and they eventually o ffered him a  full-time job. Whamo, Jeff's got a career as a bank er. In fact, after  fifteen years in the industry he and a colleague by  the name of Trey  Maust went on to start their own bank, Lewis & Clar k Bank in  Portland, Oregon.   Sumpter is very good at what he does—he's been one of the top- performing loan officers throughout his career. He' s well liked and  well respected among his colleagues and clients. Bu t even Jeff will  admit that he doesn't have much of a passion for ba nking, per se.  Though he's not living out his childhood dream, he is passionate for  something. It's not WHAT he does that gets him out of bed every  morning. It's WHY he does it.   Our career paths are largely incidental. I never pl anned to be  doing what I'm doing now. As a kid I wanted to be a n aeronautical  engineer, but in college I set my sights on becomin g a criminal pros- ecutor. While I was in law school, however, I becam e disillusioned  with the idea of being a lawyer. It just didn't fee l right. I was at law  school in England, where the law is one of the last  truly "English"  professions; not wearing a pinstriped suit to an in terview could hurt  my chances of getting a job. This was not my cup of  tea.   I happened to be dating a young woman who was study ing  marketing at Syracuse University. She could see wha t inspired me  and what frustrated me about the law and suggested I try my hand  in the field. And whamo, I'd gotten myself a new ca reer in market- ing. But that's just one of the things I've done—it 's not my passion  and it's not how I define my life. My cause—to insp ire people to do  the things that inspire them—is WHY I get out of be d every day. The  excitement is trying to find new ways, different WH ATs to bring my  cause to life, of which this book is one.   ======================================== [Página 157] ======================================== STATUS BUT WHY, BUT KNOW HOW  151 Regardless of WHAT we do in our lives, our WHY—our driving  purpose, cause or belief—never changes. If our Gold en Circle is in  balance, WHAT we do is simply the tangible way we f ind to breathe  life into that cause. Developing software was merel y one of the  things Bill Gates did to bring his cause to life. A n airline gave Herb  Kelleher the perfect outlet to spread his belief in  freedom. Putting a  man on the moon was one goal John F. Kennedy used t o rally people  to bring to life his belief that service to the nat ion—and not being  serviced by the nation—would lead America to advanc e and  prosper. Apple gave Steve Jobs a way to challenge t he status quo  and do something big in the world. All the things t hese charismatic  leaders did were the tangible ways they found to br ing their WHYs  to life. But none of them could have imagined WHAT they would be  doing when they were young.   When a WHY is clear, those who share that belief wi ll be drawn to it  and maybe want to take part in bringing it to life.  If that belief is  amplified it can have the power to rally even more believers to raise  their hands and declare, "I want to help." With a g roup of believers  all rallying around a common purpose, cause or beli ef, amazing  things can happen. But it takes more than inspirati on to do become  great. Inspiration only starts the process; you nee d something more  to drive a movement.   Amplify the Source of Inspiration   The Golden Circle is not just a communication tool;  it also  provides some insight into how great organizations are organized.  As we start to add dimension to the concept of The Golden Circle, it  is no longer helpful to look at it as a purely two- dimensional model.  If it is to provide any real value in how to build a great organization  in our very three-dimensional world, The Golden Cir cle needs to be  three-dimensional. The good news is, it is. It is, in fact, a top-down  view of a cone. Turn it on its side and you can see  its full value.   ======================================== [Página 158] ======================================== START WITH WHY  152   The cone represents a company or an organization—an   inherently hierarchical and organized system. Sitti ng at the top of  the system, representing the WHY, is a leader; in t he case of a  company, that's usually the CEO (or at least we hop e it is). The next  level down, the HOW level, typically includes the s enior executives  who are inspired by the leader's vision and know HO W to bring it  to life. Don't forget that a WHY is just a belief, HOWs are the actions  we take to realize that belief and WHATs are the re sults of those ac- tions. No matter how charismatic or inspiring the l eader is, if there  are not people in the organization inspired to brin g that vision to  reality, to build an infrastructure with systems an d processes, then  at best, inefficiency reigns, and at worst, failure  results.   In this rendering the HOW level represents a person  or a small  group responsible for building the infrastructure t hat can make a  WHY tangible. That may happen in marketing, operati ons, finance,  human resources and all the other C-suite departmen ts. Beneath  that, at the WHAT level, is where the rubber meets the road. It is at  this level that the majority of the employees sit a nd where all the  tangible stuff actually happens.   I Have a Dream (and He's Got the Plan)   Dr. King said he had a dream, and he inspired peopl e to make  his dream their own. What Ralph Abernathy lent the movement    ======================================== [Página 159] ======================================== STATUS BUT WHY, BUT KNOW HOW  153 was something else: he knew what it would take to r ealize that  dream, and he showed people HOW to do it. He gave t he dream  structure. Dr. King spoke about the philosophical i mplications of  the movement, while Abernathy, Dr. King's onetime m entor, long- time friend and financial secretary and treasurer o f the Southern  Christian Leadership Conference, would help people understand  the specific steps they needed to take. "Now," Aber nathy would tell  the audience following a rousing address by Dr. Kin g, "let me tell  you what that means for tomorrow morning."   Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was the leader, but he d idn't change  America alone. Though Dr. King inspired the movemen t, to actually  move people requires organizing. As is the case wit h almost all  great leaders, there were others around Dr. King wh o knew better  HOW to do that. For every great leader, for every W HY-type, there  is an inspired HOW -type or group of HOW -types who take the  intangible cause and build the infrastructure that can give it life.  That infrastructure is what actually makes any meas urable change  or success possible.   The leader sits at the top of the cone—at the start , the point of  WHY—while the HOW -types sit below and are responsible for ac- tually making things happen. The leader imagines th e destination  and the HOW -types find the route to get there. A destination  without a route leads to meandering and inefficienc y, something a  great many WHY-types will experience without the he lp of others to  ground them. A route without a destination, however , may be  efficient, but to what end? It's all fine and good to know how to  drive, but it's more fulfilling when you have a pla ce to go. For Dr.  King, Ralph Abernathy was one of those he inspired and who knew  HOW to make the cause actionable and tangible. "Dr.  King's job was  to interpret the ideology and theology of non-viole nce," said  Abernathy. "My job was more simple and down-to-eart h. I would  tell [people], 'Don't ride those buses."'   ======================================== [Página 160] ======================================== START WITH WHY  154 In every case of a great charismatic leader who eve r achieved  anything of significance, there was always a person  or small group  lurking in the shadows who knew HOW to take the vis ion and  make it a reality. Dr. King had a dream. But no mat ter how inspiring  a dream may be, a dream that cannot come to life st ays a dream. Dr.  King dreamed of many of the same things as countles s other African  Americans who grew up in the pre-civil rights South . He spoke of  many of the same themes. He felt the same outrage p erpetrated by  an unjust system. But it was King's unflappable opt imism and his  words that inspired a population.   Dr. King didn't change America by himself. He wasn' t a legisla- tor, for example, but legislation was created to gi ve all people in the  United States equal rights regardless of skin color . It wasn't Dr. King  who changed America; it was the movement of million s of others  whom he inspired that changed the course of history . But how do  you organize millions of people? Forget millions, h ow do you  organize hundreds or tens of people? The vision and  charisma of the  leader are enough to attract the innovators and the  early adopters.  Trusting their guts and their intuition, these peop le will make the  greatest sacrifices to help see the vision become a  reality. With each  success, with every tangible demonstration that the  vision can in  fact become reality, the more practical-minded majo rity starts to  take interest. What was previously just a dream soo n becomes a  provable and tangible reality. And when that happen s, a tipping  point can be reached and then things really get mov ing.   Those Who Know WHY Need Those Who Know HOW   The pessimists are usually right, to paraphrase Tho mas Friedman,  author of  The World Is Flat,  but it's the optimists who change the  world. Bill Gates imagined a world in which the com puter could  help us all reach our greatest potential. And it ha ppened. Now he  imagines a world in which malaria does not exist. A nd it will hap- ======================================== [Página 161] ======================================== STATUS BUT WHY, BUT KNOW HOW  155 pen. The Wright brothers imagined a world in which we'd all take  to the skies as easily as we catch the bus. And it happened. WHY-  types have the power to change the course of indust ries or even the  world ... if only they knew HOW.   WHY-types are the visionaries, the ones with the ov eractive  imaginations. They tend to be optimists who believe  that all the  things they imagine can actually be accomplished. H OW-types live  more in the here and now. They are the realists and  have a clearer  sense of all things practical. WHY-types are focuse d on the things  most people can't see, like the future. HOW -types are focused on  things most people can see and tend to be better at  building  structures and processes and getting things done. O ne is not better  than the other, they are just different ways people  naturally see and  experience the world. Gates is a WHY-type. So were the Wright  brothers. And Steve Jobs. And Herb Kelleher. But th ey didn't do it  alone. They couldn't. They needed those who knew HO W.   "If it hadn't been for my big brother, I'd have bee n in jail several  times for checks bouncing," said Walt Disney, only half joking, to a  Los Angeles audience in 1957. "I never knew what wa s in the bank.  He kept me on the straight and narrow." Walt Disney  was a WHY-  type, a dreamer whose dream came true thanks to the  help of his  more sensible older brother Roy, a HOW -type.   Walt Disney began his career creating cartoon drawi ngs for ad- vertisements, but moved quickly to making animated movies. It was  1923 and Hollywood was emerging as the heart of the  movie  business, and Walt wanted to be part of it. Roy, wh o was eight years  older, had been working at a bank. Roy was always i n awe of his  brother's talent and imagination, but he also knew that Walt was  prone to taking risks and to neglecting business af fairs. Like all  WHY guys, Walt was busy thinking about what the fut ure looked  like and often forget he was living in the present.  "Walt Disney  dreamed, drew and imagined, Roy stayed in the shado w, forming  ======================================== [Página 162] ======================================== START WITH WHY  156 an empire," wrote Bob Thomas, a Disney biographer. "A brilliant  financier and businessman, Roy helped turn Walt Dis ney's dreams  into reality, building the company that bears his b rother's name." It  was Roy who founded the Buena Vista Distribution Co mpany that  made Disney films a central part of American childh ood. It was Roy  who created the merchandising business that transfo rmed Disney  characters into household names. And, like almost e very HOW - type, Roy never wanted to be the front man, he pref erred to stay in  the background and focus on HOW to build his brothe r's vision.   Most people in the world are HOW -types. Most people are quite  functional in the real world and can do their jobs and do very well.  Some may be very successful and even make millions of dollars, but  they will never build billion-dollar businesses or change the world.  HOW -types don't need WHY-types to do well. But WHY-guy s, for  all their vision and imagination, often get the sho rt end of the stick.  Without someone inspired by their vision and the kn owledge to  make it a reality, most WHY-types end up as starvin g visionaries,  people with all the answers but never accomplishing  much  themselves.   Although so many of them fancy themselves visionari es, in real- ity most successful entrepreneurs are HOW -types. Ask an entre- preneur what they love about being an entrepreneur and most will  tell you they love to build things. That they talk about building is a  sure clue that they know HOW to get things done. A business is a  structure—systems and processes that need to be ass embled. It is the  HOW -types who are more adept at building those process es and  systems. But most companies, no matter how well bui lt, do not  become billion-dollar businesses or change the cour se of industries.  To reach the billion-dollar status, to alter the co urse of an industry,  requires a very special and rare partnership betwee n one who  knows WHY and those who know HOW.   ======================================== [Página 163] ======================================== STATUS BUT WHY, BUT KNOW HOW  157 In nearly every case of a person or an organization  that has gone  on to inspire people and do great things, there exi sts this special  partnership between WHY and HOW. Bill Gates, for ex ample, may  have been the visionary who imagined a world with a  PC on every  desk, but Paul Allen built the company. Herb Kelleh er was able to  personify and preach the cause of freedom, but it w as Rollin King  who came up with the idea for Southwest Airlines. S teve Jobs is the  rebel's evangelist, but Steve Wozniak is the engine er who made the  Apple work. Jobs had the vision, Woz had the goods.  It is the  partnership of a vision of the future and the talen t to get it done that  makes an organization great.   This relationship starts to clarify the difference between a vision  statement and a mission statement in an organizatio n. The vision is  the public statement of the founder's intent, WHY t he company  exists. It is literally the vision of a future that  does not yet exist. The  mission statement is a description of the route, th e guiding  principles—HOW the company intends to create that f uture. When  both of those things are stated clearly, the WHY-ty pe and the HOW - type are both certain about their roles in the part nership. Both are  working together with clarity of purpose and a plan  to get there. For  it to work, however, it requires more than a set of  skills, it requires  trust.   As discussed at length in part 3, trusting relation ships are in- valuable for us to feel safe. Our ability to trust people or organiza- tions allows us to take risks and feel supported in  our efforts. And  perhaps the most trusting relationship that exists is between the  visionary and the builder, the WHY-guy and the HOW -guy. In or- ganizations able to inspire, the best chief executi ves are WHY-  types—people who wake up every day to lead a cause and not just  run a company. In these organizations, the best chi ef financial of- ficers and chief operating officers are high-perfor ming HOW -types,  those with the strength of ego to admit they are no t visionaries  ======================================== [Página 164] ======================================== START WITH WHY  158 themselves but are inspired by the leader's vision and know how to  build the structure that can bring it to life. The best HOW -types  generally do not want to be out front preaching the  vision; they  prefer to work behind the scenes to build the syste ms that can make  the vision a reality. It takes the combined skill a nd effort of both for  great things to happen.   It's not an accident that these unions of WHY and H OW so often  come from families or old friendships. A shared upb ringing and life  experience increases the probability of a shared se t of values and  beliefs. In the case of family or childhood friends , upbringing and  common experiences are nearly exactly the same. Tha t's not to say  you can't find a good partner somewhere else. It's just that growing  up with somebody and having a common life experienc e increases  the likelihood of a shared common worldview.   Walt Disney and Roy Disney were brothers. Bill Gate s and Paul  Allen went to high school together in Seattle. Herb  Kelleher was  Rollin King's divorce attorney and old friend. Mart in Luther King Jr.  and Ralph Abernathy both preached in Birmingham, lo ng before  the civil rights movement took form. And Steve Jobs  and Steve  Wozniak were best friends in high school. The list goes on.   To Run or To Lead   For all the talented HOW -types running today's organizations, they  can achieve success that will last their lifetimes,  but they will spend  their lifetimes running their companies. There are many ways to be  successful and drive profits. Any number of manipul ations, only  some of which I've touched upon in this book, work quite well.  Even the ability to create a tipping point is possi ble without creating  lasting change. It's called a fad. But great organi zations function  exactly like any social movement. They inspire peop le to talk about  a product or idea, include that product in the cont ext of their  lifestyle, share the idea or even find ways to adva nce the prosperity  ======================================== [Página 165] ======================================== STATUS BUT WHY, BUT KNOW HOW  159 of the organization itself. Great organizations not  only excite the  human spirit, they inspire people to take part in h elping to advance  the cause without needing to pay them or incentiviz e them in any  particular way. No cash-back incentives or mail-in rebates required.  People feel compelled to spread the word, not becau se they have to,  but because they want to. They willingly take up ar ms to share the  message that inspires them.   Build a Megaphone That Works   After a three-month selection process, BCI finally chose a new ad  agency to help develop a campaign to launch their n ew product  line. Big Company Incorporated is a well-known bran d operating in  a fairly cluttered market space. As a manufacturer,  their products  are sold via a third-party sales force, often on th e shelves of big-box  retailers, so they don't have direct control over t he sales process. The  best they can do is to try to influence the sale fr om a distance— with  marketing. BCI is a good company with a strong cult ure. The  employees respect the management, and in general th e company  does good work. But over the years the competition has grown  fairly stiff. And although BCI has a good product a nd competitive  pricing, it is still tough to maintain strong growt h year over year.  This year, BCI management is particularly excited b ecause the  company is launching a new product they really thin k will make  BCI stand out. To help promote it, BCI's agency has  launched a  major new ad campaign.   "From the leading maker," says the new ad, "comes t he newest,  most innovative product you've ever seen." The ad g oes on to talk  about all the new features and benefits, and includ es something  about the "quality you've come to expect from BCI,"  something the  BCI executives felt quite strongly about including.  BCI executives  have worked hard to build their company's reputatio n and they  want to leverage it. They are very excited about th eir new campaign  ======================================== [Página 166] ======================================== START WITH WHY  160 and are really banking on the success of this produ ct to help drive  sales in general. They know they do good work, and they want to  get the message out. They need it to be loud. And w ith a budget of  millions of dollars to advertise their new product,  in that respect,  BCI succeeds.   But there is a problem.   BCI and their agency did a good job of telling peop le about their  new product. The work was quite creative. They were  able to  explain what was new and special about their latest  innovation, and  focus groups agreed that the new product was much b etter than  that of the competition. The millions of dollars in  media ensured  that lots of people would see their advertising and  see it often. Their  reach and frequency, the measurement commonly used by ad  agencies to gauge the number of people exposed to t he advertising,  was very good. There is no doubt that their message  was loud. The  problem was, it wasn't clear. It was all WHATs and HOW and no  WHY. Even though people learned what the product di d, no one  knew what BCI believed. The good news is, it's not a complete loss;  the products will sell as long as the ads are on th e air and the  promotions remain competitive. It's an effective st rategy, but an  expensive way to make money.   What if Martin Luther King had delivered a comprehe nsive  twelve-point plan about achieving civil rights in A merica, a plan  more comprehensive than any other plan for civil ri ghts ever of- fered? Booming through the speakers that summer's d ay in 1963, his  message would have been loud. Microphones, like adv ertising and  PR, are fantastic for making sure a message is hear d. Like BCI,  King's message would still have reached thousands o f people. But  his belief would not have been clear.   Volume is reasonably easy to achieve. All it takes is money or  stunts. Money can pay to keep a message front and c enter. And  publicity stunts are good at getting on the news. B ut neither plants  ======================================== [Página 167] ======================================== STATUS BUT WHY, BUT KNOW HOW  161 seeds of loyalty. Many reading this may remember th at Oprah Win- frey once gave away a free car to every member of h er studio audi- ence. It happened several years ago, in 2004, and s till people refer to  the stunt. But how many can recall the model of car  she gave away?  That's the problem. It was Pontiac that donated $7 million worth of  cars, 276 of their new G6 model, to be exact. And i t was Pontiac that  saw the stunt as a way to market their new car. Yet  although the  stunt worked well to reinforce Oprah's generous nat ure, something  with which we are all familiar, few remember that P ontiac was a  part of the event. Worse, the stunt didn't do anyth ing to reinforce  some purpose, cause or belief that Pontiac represen ts. We had no  idea what Pontiac's WHY was before the stunt, so it ’s hard for the  publicity stunt to do much more than, well, be a st unt to get some  publicity. With no sense of WHY, there is nothing e lse it's doing.   For a message to have real impact, to affect behavi or and seed  loyalty, it needs more than publicity. It needs to publicize some  higher purpose, cause or belief to which those with  similar values  and beliefs can relate. Only then can the message c reate any lasting  mass-market success. For a stunt to appeal to the l eft side of the  curve of the Law of Diffusion, WHY the stunt is bei ng performed,  beyond the desire to generate press, must be clear.  Though there  may be short-term benefits without clarity, loud is  nothing more  than excessive volume. Or in business vernacular: c lutter. And  companies wonder why differentiation is such a chal lenge these  days. Have you heard the volume coming from some of  them?1   In contrast, what would have been the impact of Dr.  King’s  speech had he not had a microphone and loudspeakers ? His vision  would have been no less clear. His words would have  been no less  inspiring. He knew what he believed and he spoke wi th passion and  charisma about that belief. But only the few people  with front-row  seats would have been inspired by those words. A le ader with a  cause, whether it be an individual or an organizati on, must have a  ======================================== [Página 168] ======================================== START WITH WHY  162 megaphone through which to deliver his message. And  it must be  clear and loud to work. Clarity of purpose, cause o r belief is  important, but it is equally important that people hear you. For a  WHY to have the power to move people it must not on ly be clear, it  must be amplified to reach enough people to tip the  scale.   It's no coincidence that the three-dimensional Gold en Circle is a  cone. It is, in practice, a megaphone. An organizat ion effectively  becomes the vessel through which a person with a cl ear purpose,  cause or belief can speak to the outside world. But  for a megaphone  to work, clarity must come first. Without a clear m essage, what will  you amplify?   Say It Only If You Believe It   Dr. King used his megaphone to rally throngs of peo ple to follow  him in pursuit of social justice. The Wright brothe rs used their  megaphone to rally their local community to help th em build the  technology that could change the world. Thousands o f people heard  John F. Kennedy's belief in service and rallied to put a man on the  moon in less than a decade. The ability to excite a nd inspire people  to go out of their way to contribute to something b igger than  themselves is not unique to social causes. Any orga nization is  capable of building a megaphone that can achieve a huge impact. In  fact, it is one of the defining factors that makes an organization  great. Great organizations don't just drive profits , they lead people,  and they change the course of industries and someti mes our lives in  the process.   A clear sense of WHY sets expectations. When we don 't know an  organization's WHY, we don't know what to expect, s o we expect  the minimum—price, quality, service, features—the c ommodity  stuff. But when we do have a sense for the WHY, we expect more.  For those not comfortable being held to a higher st andard, I strongly  advise against trying to learn your WHY or keeping your Golden  ======================================== [Página 169] ======================================== STATUS BUT WHY, BUT KNOW HOW  163 Circle in balance. Higher standards are hard to mai ntain. It requires  the discipline to constantly talk about and remind everyone WHY  the organization exists in the first place. It requ ires that everyone in  the organization be held accountable to HOW you do things—to  your values and guiding principles. And it takes ti me and effort to  ensure that everything you say and do is consistent  with your  WHY. But for those willing to put in the effort, th ere are some great  advantages.   Richard Branson first built Virgin Records into a m ultibillion-  dollar retail music brand. Then he started a succes sful record label.   Later he started an airline that is today considere d one of the pre- mier airlines in the world. He then started a soda brand, wedding-  planning company, insurance company and mobile phon e service.  And the list goes on. Likewise, Apple sells us comp uters, mobile  phones, DVRs and mp3 players, and has replicated th eir capacity  for innovation again and again. The ability of some  companies not  to just succeed but to repeat their success is due to the loyal  followings they command, the throngs of people who root for their  success. In the business world, they say Apple is a  lifestyle brand.  They underestimate Apple's power. Gucci is a lifest yle brand— Apple changes the course of industries. By any defi nition these few  companies don't function like corporate entities. T hey exist as social  movements.   Repeating Greatness   Ron Bruder is not a household name, but he is a gre at leader. In  1985, he stood at a crosswalk with his two daughter s waiting for the  light to change so they could cross the street. A p erfect opportunity,  he thought, to teach the young girls a valuable lif e lesson. He  pointed across the street to the red glow of the "D o Not Walk" signal  and asked them what they thought that sign meant. " It means we  ======================================== [Página 170] ======================================== START WITH WHY  164 have to stand here," they replied. "Are you sure?" he asked  rhetorically. "How do you know it's not telling us to run?"   Soft-spoken and almost always wearing a well-tailor ed three- piece  suit when he comes to work, Bruder looks like you w ould imagine a  conservative executive to look like. But don't assu me you know how  things work simply based on what you see. Bruder is  anything but a  stereotype. Though he has enjoyed the trappings of success, he is not  motivated by them. They have always been the uninte nded by- product of his work. Bruder is driven by a clear se nse of WHY. He  sees a world in which people accept the lives they live and do the  things they do not because they have to, but becaus e no one ever  showed them an alternative. This is the lesson he w as teaching his  daughters that day at the crosswalk—there is always  another  perspective to be considered. That Bruder always st arts with WHY  has enabled him to achieve great things for himself . But more  significantly, it is his ability to share his WHY t hrough the things he  does that inspires those around him to do great thi ngs for  themselves.   Like most of us, the career path Bruder has followe d is incidental.  But WHY he does things has never changed. Everythin g Bruder has  ever done starts with his WHY, his unyielding belie f that if you can  simply show someone that an alternative route is po ssible, it can  open the possibility that such a route can be follo wed. Though the  work he is doing today is world-altering, Bruder ha sn't always been  in the world peace business. Like many inspiring le aders, he has  changed the course of an industry. But Ron Bruder i s no one-hit  wonder. He has been able to repeat his success and change the  course of multiple industries, multiple times.   A senior executive at a large food conglomerate tha t sold vege- tables, canned goods and meats decided to buy a tra vel agency for  his nephew. He asked Bruder, as the chief financial  officer of the  company at the time, to take a look at the financia ls of the agency  ======================================== [Página 171] ======================================== STATUS BUT WHY, BUT KNOW HOW  165 before he went through with the purchase. Seeing an  opportunity  others didn't, Bruder decided to join the small tra vel agency to help  lead it. Once there, he saw how all the other trave l agencies worked  and took an alternative course. Greenwell became th e first travel  agency on the eastern seaboard to take advantage of  new technolo- gies and fully computerize their operations. Not on ly did they be- come one of the most successful companies in the re gion, but after  only a year, their business model became a standard  for the whole  industry. Then Bruder did it again.   A former client of Bruder's, Sam Rosengarten, was i n some dirty  businesses—coal, oil and gas; all industries that c reated brown-  fields, land that had been contaminated by their op erations. Little  could be done with brownfields. They were too pollu ted to develop,  and the liability to clean them up was so high that  the insurance  premiums alone made it too prohibitive to even try.  But Bruder  doesn't see challenges the same way as everyone els e. Most avoided  brownfields because they could only see the cost to  clean them up.  Bruder focused instead on the actual cleaning. His alternative  perspective revealed the perfect solution.   Bruder had already formed his real estate developme nt  company, Brookhill, and with eighteen employees, he  was doing  quite well. Knowing what he needed to do to seize t he opportunity,  he approached Dames & Moore, one of the largest env ironmental  engineering companies in the world, and shared his new  perspective with them. They loved his idea and form ed a  partnership to pursue it. With an engineering compa ny with 18,000  people on board, the perceived risk was greatly min imized and the  insurance companies were happy to offer affordable insurance. With  affordable insurance in place, Credit Suisse First Boston offered  financing that gave Brookhill the ability to buy, r emediate,  redevelop and sell almost $200 million worth of for mer  environmentally contaminated properties. Brookhill,  so called  ======================================== [Página 172] ======================================== START WITH WHY  166 because Bruder comes from Brooklyn and, as he puts it, "it's a long,  uphill climb to get out of Brooklyn," was the pione er of the  brownfield redevelopment industry. An industry that  thrives to this  day. Bruder's WHY not only steered a path that was good for  business, but in the process also helped clean up t he environment.   It doesn't matter WHAT Ron Bruder does. The industr ies and the  challenges are incidental. What never changes is WH Y he does  things. Bruder knows that, no matter how good an op portunity  looks on paper, no matter how smart he is and no ma tter his track  record, he would never be able to achieve anything unless there  were others to help him. He knows that success is a  team sport He  has a remarkable ability to attract those who belie ve what he  believes. Talented people are drawn to him with one  request: "How  can I help?" Having defied accepted perspectives an d revolutionized  more than one industry, Bruder has now set his sigh ts on a bigger  challenge: world peace. He founded the Education fo r Employment  Foundation, the megaphone that would help him do it .   The EFE Foundation is making significant headway in  helping  young men and women in the Middle East to significa ntly alter the  course of their lives and indeed the course of the region. Just has he  taught his daughters at the crosswalk that there is  always an alter- native route, he brings an alternative perspective to the problems in  Middle East. Like of all Bruder's past successes, t he EFE Foundation  will drive businesses and do tremendous amounts of good in the  process. Bruder doesn't run companies, he leads mov ements.   All Movements Are Personal   It started on September 11,2001. Like so many of us , Bruder turned  his attention to the Middle East after the attacks to ask why some- thing like that could happen. He understood that if  such an event  could happen once, it could happen again, and for t he lives of his  own daughters he wanted to find a way to prevent th at.   ======================================== [Página 173] ======================================== STATUS BUT WHY, BUT KNOW HOW  167 In the course of trying to figure out what he could  do, he made a  remarkable discovery that went much deeper than pro tecting his  daughters or even the prevention of terrorism in th e United States.  In America, he realized, the vast majority of young  people wake up  in the morning with a feeling that there is opportu nity for them in  the future. Regardless of the economy, most young b oys and girls  who grow up in the United States have an inherent s ense of opti- mism that they can achieve something if they want t o—to live the  American Dream. A young boy growing up in Gaza or a  young girl  living in Yemen does not wake up every day with the  same feeling.  Even if they have the desire, the same optimism is not there. It is too  easy to point and say that the culture is different . That is not  actionable. The real reason is that there is a dist inct lack of institu- tions to give young people in the region a sense of  optimism for  their future. A college education in Jordan, for ex ample, may offer  some social status, but it doesn't necessarily prep are a young adult  for what lies ahead. The education system, in cases  like this, per- petuates a systemic cultural pessimism.   Bruder realized the problems we face with terrorism  in the West  have less to do with what young boys and girls in t he Middle East  think about America and more to do with what they t hink about  themselves and their own vision of the future. Thro ugh the EFE  Foundation, Bruder is setting up programs across th e Middle East to  teach young adults the hard and soft skills that wi ll help them feel  like they have opportunity in life. To feel like th ey can be in control  of their own destinies. Bruder is using the EFE Fou ndation to share  his WHY on a global scale—to teach people that ther e is always an  alternative to the path they think they are on.   The Education for Employment Foundation is not an A merican  charity hoping to do good in faraway lands. It is a  global movement.  Each EFE operation runs independently, with locals making up the  majority of their local boards. Local leaders take personal responsi- ======================================== [Página 174] ======================================== START WITH WHY  168 bility to give young men and women that feeling of opportunity by  giving them the skills, knowledge and, most importa ntly, the  confidence to choose an alternative path for themse lves. Mayyada  Abu-Jaber is leading the movement in Jordan. Mohamm ad Naja is  spreading the cause in Gaza and the West Bank. And Maeen Alery-  ani is proving that a cause can even change a cultu re in Yemen.   In Yemen, children can expect to receive nine years  of education;  This is one of the lowest rates in the world. In th e United States,  children can expect sixteen years. Inspired by Brud er, Aleryani sees  such an amazing opportunity for young men and women  to change  their perspective and take greater control of their  own future. He set  out to find capital to jump-start his EFE operation  in Sana'a,  Yemen's capital, and in one week was able to raise $50,000. The  speed at which he raised that amount is pretty good  even by our  philanthropic standards. But this is Yemen, and Yem en has no  culture of philanthropy, making his achievement tha t much more  remarkable. Yemen is also one of the poorest nation s in the region.  But when you tell people WHY you're doing what you' re doing,  remarkable things happen.   Across the region, everyone involved in EFE believe s that they  can help teach their brothers and sisters and sons and daughters the  skills that will help them change path that they  think  they are on.  They are working to help the youth across the regio n believe that  their future is bright and full of opportunity. And  they don't do it for  Bruder, they do it for themselves. That's the reaso n EFE will change  the world.   Sitting at the top of the megaphone, at the point o f WHY,  Bruder's role is to inspire, to start the movement.  But it is those who  believe who will effect the real change and keep th e movement  going. Anyone, regardless where they live, what the y do or their  nationality, can participate in this movement. It's  about feeling like  we belong.

Their  heads shaved, their clothes gray and tattered. Thei r boots dusty. One  by one, they filled a large, cavernous room, like a  hangar from a sci- ence fiction movie. The only color was gray. The wa lls were gray  Dust and smoke filled the space making even the air  look gray.   Hundreds, maybe even thousands of these drone-peopl e sat on  neatly organized benches. Row after row after row. A sea of gray  conformity. They all watched a projection of a huge  talking head on  the screen in the front of the room that filled the  entire wall. This  apparent leader recited dogma and propaganda, stati ng proudly  that they were in complete control. They had achiev ed perfection,  They were free of pests. Or so they thought.   ======================================== [Página 178] ======================================== START WITH WHY  172 Running down one of the tunnels that led into the c avernous  hangar, a lone blonde woman. She wore bright red sh orts and a  crisp white T-shirt. Like a lighthouse, her complex ion and the color  of hei clothes seemed to shine through gray air. Pu rsued by security,  she rail with a sledgehammer. This would not end we ll for the status  quo.   On January 22, 1984, Apple launched their Macintosh  computer  with their now-famous commercial depicting an Orwel lian scene of  a totalitarian regime holding control over a popula tion and  promised that "1984 won't be like  1984"  But this advertising was  much more than just advertising. It was not about t he features and  benefits of a new product. It was not about a "diff erentiating value  proposition." It was, for all intents and purposes,  a manifesto. A  poetic ode to Apple's WHY, it was the film version of an individual  rebelling against the status quo, igniting a revolu tion. And though  their products have changed and fashions have chang ed, this  commercial is as relevant today as it was twenty-fi ve years ago  when it first aired. And that's because a WHY never  changes.  WHAT you do can change with the times, but WHY you do it never  does.   The commercial is one of the many things the compan y has done  or said over the years to show or tell the outside world what they  believe. All Apple's advertising and communications , their  products, partnerships, their packaging, their stor e design, they are  all WHATs to Apple's WHY, proof that they actively challenge sta- tus quo thinking to empower the individual. Ever no tice that their  advertising never shows groups enjoying their produ cts? Always  individuals. Their Think Different campaign depicte d individuals  who thought differently, never groups. Always indiv iduals. And  when Apple tells us to "Think Different," they are not just describing  themselves. The ads showed pictures of Pablo Picass o, Martha  Graham, Jim Henson, Alfred Hitchcock, to name a few , with the line  ======================================== [Página 179] ======================================== KNOW WHY, KNOW HOW, THEN WHAT?  173 "Think Different" on the upper right hand side of t he page. Apple  does not embody the rebel spirit because they assoc iated themselves  with known rebels. They chose known rebels because they embody  the same rebel spirit. The WHY came before the crea tive solution in  the advertising. Not a single ad showed a group. Th is is no accident.  Empowering the individual spirit is WHY Apple exist s. Apple  knows their WHY and so do we. Agree with them or no t, we know  what they believe because they tell us.   Speak Clearly and Ye Shall Be Clearly Understood   An organization is represented by the cone in the t hree-dimensional  view of The Golden Circle. This organized system si ts atop another  system: the marketplace. The marketplace is made up  of all the cus- tomers and potential customers, all the press, the shareholders, all  the competition, suppliers and all the money. This system is  ======================================== [Página 180] ======================================== START WITH WHY  174 inherently chaotic and disorganized. The only conta ct that the  organized system has with the disorganized system i s at the base— at the WHAT level. Everything an organization says and does  communicates the leader's vision to the outside wor ld. All the  products and services that the company sells, all t he marketing and  advertising, all the contact with the world outside  communicate  this. If people don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY  you do it,  and if all the things happening at the WHAT level d o not clearly  represent WHY the company exists, then the ability to inspire is  severely complicated.   When a company is small, this is not an issue becau se the  founder has plenty of direct contact with the outsi de world. Trusted  HOW -types may be in short supply and the founder opts to make a  majority of the big decisions. The founder or leade r actually goes  out and talks to customers, sells the product and h ires most if not all  the employees. As the company grows, however, syste ms and  processes are added and other people will join. The  cause embodied  by an individual slowly morphs into a structured or ganization and  the cone starts to take shape. As it grows, the lea der's role changes.  He will no longer be the loudest part of the megaph one; he will  become the source of the message that is to flow th rough the  megaphone.   When a company is small, it revolves around the per sonality of  the founder. There is no debate that the founder's personality is the  personality of the company. Why then do we think th ings change  just because a company is successful? What's the di fference between  Steve Jobs the man and Apple the company? Nothing. What's the  difference between Sir Richard Branson's personalit y and Virgin's  personality? Nothing. As a company grows, the CEO's  job is to per- sonify the WHY. To ooze of it. To talk about it. To  preach it. To be a  symbol of what the company believes. They are the i ntention and  WHAT the company says and does is their voice. Like  Martin Lu- ======================================== [Página 181] ======================================== KNOW WHY, KNOW HOW, THEN WHAT?  175 ther King and his social movement, the leader's job  is no longer to  close all the deals; it is to inspire.   As the organization grows, the leader becomes physi cally re- moved, farther and farther away from WHAT the compa ny does,  and even farther away from the outside market. I lo ve asking CEOs  what their biggest priority is, and, depending on t heir size or struc- ture, I generally get one of two answers: customers  or shareholders.  Sadly, there aren't many CEOs of companies of any r easonable size  who have daily contact with customers anymore. And customers  and shareholders alike both exist outside the organ ization in the  chaotic world of the marketplace. Just as the cone demonstrates, the  CEO's job, the leader's responsibility, is not to f ocus on the outside  market—it's to focus on the layer directly beneath:  HOW. The leader  must ensure that there are people on the team who b elieve what  they believe and know HOW to build it. The HOW - types are  responsible for understanding WHY and must come to work every  day to develop the systems and hire the people who are ultimately  responsible for bringing the WHY to life. The gener al employees are  responsible for demonstrating the WHY to the outsid e world in  whatever the company says and does. The challenge i s that they are  able to do it clearly.   Remember the biology of The Golden Circle. The WHY exists in  the part of the brain that controls feelings and de cision-making but  not language. WHATs exist in the part of the brain that controls  rational thought and language. Comparing the biolog y of the brain  to the three-dimensional rendering of The Golden Ci rcle reveals a  profound insight.   ======================================== [Página 182] ======================================== START WITH WHY  176   The leader sitting at the top of the organization i s the inspiration,  the symbol of the reason we do what we do. They rep resent the  emotional limbic brain. WHAT the company says and d oes  represents the rational thought and language of the  neocortex. Just  as it is hard for people to speak their feelings, l ike someone trying to  explain why they love their spouse, it is equally h ard for an  organization to explain its WHY. The part of the br ain that controls  feelings and the part that controls language are no t the same. Given  that the cone is simply a three-dimensional renderi ng of The Golden  Circle, which is firmly grounded in the biology of human decision- making, the logic follows that organizations of any  size will struggle  to clearly communicate their WHY.

Gr eat societies  understand the importance of symbols as a way of re inforcing their  values, of capturing their beliefs. Dictators under stand the impor- tance of symbols all too well. But in their case, t he symbols are  usually of them and not of a larger belief. Symbols  help us make tan- gible that which is intangible. And the only reason  symbols have  meaning is because we infuse them with meaning. Tha t meaning  lives in our minds, not in the item itself. Only wh en the purpose,  cause or belief is clear can a symbol command great  power.   The flag, for example, is nothing more than a symbo l of out  nation's values and beliefs. And we follow the flag  into battle. That's  some serious power. Ever notice the patch of the Am erican flag on a  soldier's right arm? It's backward. There was no mi stake made, it's  like that on purpose.

Our flag is infused with so much meaning that some have tried  to pass laws banning its desecration. It's not the material out of  which the flag is sewn that these patriots aim to p rotect. The laws  they propose have nothing to do with the destructio n of property.  Their goal is to protect the meaning the symbol rep resents: the  WHY. The laws they drafted tried to protect the int angible set of  values and beliefs by protecting the symbol of thos e values and  beliefs. Though the laws have been struck down by t he Supreme  Court, they have spurred contentious and emotionall y charged de- bates. They pit our desire for freedom of expressio n with our desire  to protect a symbol of that freedom.   Ronald Reagan, the Great Communicator, knew all too  well the  power of symbols. In 1982, he was the first preside nt to invite a  "hero" to sit in the balcony of the House chamber d uring the State of  the Union address, a tradition that has continued e very year since.  A man who exuded optimism, Reagan knew the value of   symbolizing the values of America instead of just t alking about  them. His guest, who sat with the First Lady, was L enny Skutnik, a  government employee who had dived into the icy Poto mac just  days before to save a woman who had fallen from a h elicopter that  was attempting to rescue her after an Air Florida p lane crashed into  the river. Reagan was trying to make a point, that words are hollow,  but deeds and values are deep. After he told Skutni k's story he  waxed, "Don't let anyone tell you that America's be st days are be- hind her, that the American spirit has been vanquis hed. We've seen  it triumph too often in our lives to stop believing  in it now." Skutnik  became Reagan's symbol of courage.   Most companies have logos, but few have been able t o convert  those logos into meaningful symbols. Because most c ompanies are  bad at communicating what they believe, so it follo ws that most  ======================================== [Página 187] ======================================== COMMUNICATION IS NOT ABOUT SPEAKING, IT’S LISTENING   181 logos are devoid of any meaning. At best they serve  as icons to  identify a company and its products. A symbol canno t have any  deep meaning until we know WHY it exists in terms b igger than  simply to identify the company. Without clarity of WHY, a logo is  just a logo.   To say that a logo stands for quality, service, inn ovation and the  like only reinforces its status as just a logo. The se qualities are about  the company and not about the cause. Don't forget t he dictators.  They understand the power of symbols, except the sy mbols are  often of them. Likewise, so many companies act like  dictators—it's  all about them and what they want. They tell us wha t to do, they tell  us what we need, they tell us they have the answers  but they do not  inspire us and they do not command our loyalty. And  to take the  analogy a step further, the way dictators maintain their power is  through fear, reward and every other manipulation t hey can think  of. People follow dictators not because they want t o, but because  they have to. For companies to be perceived as a gr eat leaders and  not dictators, all their symbols, including their l ogos, need to stand  for something in which we can all believe. Somethin g we can all  support. That takes clarity, discipline and consist ency.   For a logo to become a symbol, people must be inspi red to use  that logo to say something about who they are. Cout ure fashion  labels are the most obvious example of this. People  use them to  demonstrate status. But many of them are somewhat g eneric in  what they symbolize. There is a more profound examp le: Harley-  Davidson.   There are people who walk around with Harley-Davids on tat- toos on their bodies. That's insane. They've tattoo ed a corporate logo  on their skin. Some of them don't even own the prod uct! Why  would rational people tattoo a corporate logo on th eir bodies? The  reason is simple. After years of Harley being cryst al clear about  what they believe, after years of being disciplined  about a set of  ======================================== [Página 188] ======================================== START WITH WHY  182 values and guiding principles and after years of be ing doggedly  consistent about everything they say and do, their logo has become  a symbol. It no longer simply identifies a company and its products;  it identifies a belief.   In truth, most people who tattoo Harley-Davidson lo gos on their  bodies have no idea what the stock price of Harley is. They have no  idea about some management shake-up the week before . That  symbol is no longer about Harley. The logo embodies  an en- tire  value set—their own. The symbol is no longer about Harley, it's  about them. Randy Fowler, a former U.S. Marine and now general  manager of a Harley-Davidson dealership in Californ ia, proudly  sports a large Harley tattoo on his left arm. "It s ymbolizes who I  am," he says. "Mostly, it says I'm an American." Cu stomer and com- pany are now one and the same. The meaning of Harle y-Davidson  has value in people's lives because, for those who believe in Harley's  WHY, it helps them express the meaning of their own  lives.   Because of Harley's clarity, discipline and consist ency, most will  know what that symbol means, even if you don't subs cribe to it  yourself. That's the reason why when someone walks into a bar  with a big Harley logo on his arm we take a step ba ck and give him  a wide berth. The symbol has become so meaningful, in fact, that 12  percent of Harley-Davidson revenues are strictly fr om merchan- dising. That's remarkable.   It's not just logos, however, that can serve as sym bols. Symbols  are any tangible representation of a clear set of v alues and beliefs.  An ink-stained finger for Iraqis was a symbol of a new beginning. A  London double-decker bus or a cowboy hat—both are s ymbols of  national cultures. But national symbols are easy be cause most  nations have a clear sense of culture that has been  reinforced and  repeated for generations. It is not a company or or ganization that  decides what, it symbols mean, it is the group outs ide the mega- phone, in the chaotic marketplace, who decide. If, based on the  ======================================== [Página 189] ======================================== COMMUNICATION IS NOT ABOUT SPEAKING, IT’S LISTENING   183 things they see and hear, the outsiders can clearly  and consistently  report what an organization believes, then, and onl y then, can a  symbol start to take on meaning. It is the truest t est of how effective  a megaphone has been produced—when clarity is able to filter all  the way through the organization and come to life i n everything  that comes out of it.   Go back to Apple's "1984" commercial at the beginni ng of  chapter 9. For those who have seen it, does it make  you think about  Apple and its products or do you simply like the se ntiment? Or the  line "Think Different," does it speak to you?   If you're a Mac customer, you probably loved this c ommercial; it  may even give you goose bumps when you watch it—a s urefire test  that the WHY is connecting with you on a visceral o r limbic level. In  fact, this commercial, after you learned it was fro m Apple, may have  reinforced your decision to buy a Mac, whether for the first time or  the tenth time. This commercial, like all Apple's a dvertising, is one  of the things Apple has said or done that reinforce s what they  believe. It is every bit consistent with the clear belief we know they  embody. And if the commercial speaks to you and you 're not an  Apple lover, odds are you still like the idea of th inking differently.  The message of that ad is one of the things Apple d oes to tell their  story. It is one of the WHATs to their WHY. It is a  symbol. It is for  these reasons that we say of a piece of advertising ; "It really speaks  to me." It's not really speaking to you, it's speak ing to the millions of  people who saw the ad. When we say that something l ike that  "speaks to me," what we're really saying is, throug h all this clutter  and noise, I can hear that. I can hear it and I wil l listen. This is what  it means for a message that comes out of the megaph one to resonate.   Everything that comes out of the base of the megaph one serves  as a way for an organization to articulate what it believes. What a  company says and does are the means by which the co mpany  speaks. Too many companies put a disproportionate a mount of  ======================================== [Página 190] ======================================== START WITH WHY  184 weight on their products or services simply because  those are the  things that bring in the money. But there are many more things at  the base of the megaphone that play an equal role i n speaking to the  outside world. Though products may drive sales, the y alone cannot  create loyalty. In fact, a company can create loyal ty among people  who aren't even customers. I spoke favorably of App le long before I  bought one. And I spoke disparagingly of a certain PC brand even  though I'd been buying their products for years.   Apple's clarity, discipline and consistency—their a bility to build  a megaphone, not a company, that is clear and loud— is what  has  given them the ability to command such loyalty. The y are accused of  having a cultlike following. Those inside the compa ny are often  accused of following the "cult of Steve." All of th ese compliments or  insults are indications that others have taken on t he cause and made  it their own. That experts describe their products and marketing as a  "lifestyle" reinforces that people who love Apple p roducts are using  WHAT Apple does to demonstrate their own personal i dentity. We  call it "lifestyle marketing" because people have i ntegrated  commercial products into the style of their lives. Apple, with great  efficiency, built a perfectly clear megaphone, leve raged the Law of  Diffusion and invited others to help spread the gos pel. Not for the  company, for themselves.   Even their promotions and partnerships serve as tan gible proof  of what they believe. In 2003 and 2004, Apple ran a  promotion for  iTunes with Pepsi—the cola branded as "the choice o f the next gen- eration." It made sense that Apple would do a deal with Pepsi, the  primary challenger to Coca-Cola, the status quo. Ev erything Apple  does, everything they say and do, serves as tangibl e proof of what  they believe. The reason I use Apple so extensively  throughout this  book is that Apple is so disciplined in HOW they do  things and so  consistent in WHAT they do that, love them or hate them, we all  have a sense of their WHY. We know what they believ e.   ======================================== [Página 191] ======================================== COMMUNICATION IS NOT ABOUT SPEAKING, IT’S LISTENING   185 Most of us didn't read books about them. We don't p ersonally  know Steve Jobs. We haven't spent time roaming the halls of Apple's  headquarters to get to know their culture. The clar ity we have for  what Apple believes comes from one place and one pl ace only:  Apple. People don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY y ou do it,  and Apple says and does only the things they believ e. If WHAT you  do doesn't prove what you believe, then no one will  know what  your WHY is and you'll be forced to compete on pric e, service,  quality, features and benefits; the stuff of commod ities. Apple has a  clear and loud megaphone and is exceptionally good at commu- nicating its story.   The Celery Test   In order to improve HOW and WHAT we do, we constant ly look to  what others are doing. We attend conferences, read books, talk to  friends and colleagues to get their input and advic e, and sometimes  we are also the dispensers of advice. We are in pur suit of  understanding the best practices of others to help guide us. But it is  a flawed assumption that what works for one organiz ation will  work for another. Even if the industries, sizes and  market conditions  are the same, the notion that "if it's good for the m, it's good for us" is  simply not true.   I know of a company with an amazing culture. When a sked; the  employees say they love that all the conference roo ms have ping- pong tables in them. Does that mean that if you wer e to put ping- pong tables in all your conference rooms your cultu re would  improve? Of course not. But this is an example of " best practices."  The idea that copying WHAT or HOW things are done a t high- performing organizations will inherently work for y ou i$ just not  true. Like the Ferrari and the Honda, what is good for on<f  ======================================== [Página 192] ======================================== START WITH WHY  186 company is not necessarily good for another. Put si mply, best prac- tices are not always best.   It is not just WHAT or HOW you do things that matte rs; what  matters more is that WHAT and HOW you do things is consistent  with your WHY. Only then will your practices indeed  be best. There  is nothing inherently wrong with looking to others to learn what;  they do, the challenge is knowing what practices or  advice to follow.  Fortunately, there is a simple test you can apply t o find out exactly  WHAT and HOW is right for you. It's a simple metaph or called the  Celery Test.   Imagine you go to a dinner party and somebody comes  up to  you and says, "You know what you need in your organ ization?  M&M's. If you're not using M&M's in your business, you're leaving  money on the table."   Somebody else comes up to you and says, "You know w hat you  need? Rice milk. The data shows that all the people  are buying rice  milk these days. You should be selling rice milk in  this economy."   While you're standing over the punch bowl, yet anot her person  offers some sage advice. "Oreo cookies," he says. " We made millions;  from implementing Oreo cookies in our organization.  You've got to  do it."   Still somebody else comes up to you and says, "Cele ry. You've  got to get into celery."   You get all this great advice from all these highly  accomplished  people. Some of them are in the same industry. Some  of them are  more successful than you. Some of them have offered  similar advice  to others with great success. Now, what do you do?   You go to the supermarket and you buy celery, rice milk, Oreos  and M&M's. You spend a lot of time at the supermark et walking the  aisles. You spend a lot of money because you buy ev erything. But  you may or may not get any value from some or all o f these  products; there are no guarantees. Worse, if you're  budget- ======================================== [Página 193] ======================================== COMMUNICATION IS NOT ABOUT SPEAKING, IT’S LISTENING   187 constrained, you had to whittle down your choices a gain. And then  which do you choose?   But one thing's for sure: when you're standing in l ine at the  supermarket with all of these items in your arms, y our celery, rice  milk, Oreos and M&Ms, nobody can see what you belie ve. What  you do is supposed serve as the tangible proof of w hat you believe,  and you bought everything.   But what if you knew your WHY before you went to th e super- market? What if your WHY is to do only things that are healthy? To  always do the things that are good for your body? Y ou'll get all the  same good advice from all the same people, the only  difference is,  the next time you go to the supermarket, you'll buy  only rice milk  and celery. Those are the only products that make s ense. It's not that  the other advice isn't good advice, it's just not g ood for you. The  advice doesn't fit.   Filtering your decisions through your WHY, you spen d less time  at the supermarket and you spend less money, so the re's an  efficiency advantage also. You're guaranteed to get  value out of all  the products you bought. And, most importantly, whe n you're  standing in line with your products in your arms, e verybody can see  what you believe. With only celery and rice milk it 's obvious to  people walking by what you believe. "I can  see  that you believe in  looking after your health," they may say to you. "I  feel the same  way| I have a question for you." Congratulations. Y ou just attracted  ^ customer, an employee, a partner or a referral si mply by making  the right decisions. Simply ensuring that WHAT you do proves  what you believe makes it easy for those who believ e what you  believe to find you. You have successfully communic ated your  WHY* based on WHAT you do.   This is an idealistic concept and in the real world  that level of  discipline is not always possible. I understand tha t sometimes we  have to make short-term decisions to pay bills or g et some shortterm  ======================================== [Página 194] ======================================== START WITH WHY  188 advantage. That's fine. The Celery Test still appli es. If you want a  piece of chocolate cake, go right ahead. The differ ence is*; when you  start with WHY, you know full well that the chocola te' cake is a  short-term decision that doesn't fit with your beli efs. You're under  no illusions. You know you are only doing it for th e short-term  sugar rush and you'll have to work a little harder to get it out of  your system. It's astounding the number of business es I see that  view an opportunity as the one that's going to set them on a path to  glory, only to have it blow up or slowly deflate ov er time.; They see  the chocolate cake and can't resist. Starting with WHY not only  helps you know which is the right advice for you to  follow, but also  to know which decisions will put you out of balance . You can;  certainly make those decisions if you need to, but don't make too!  many of them, otherwise over time, no one will know  what you;  believe.   But here's the best part. As soon as I told you the  WHY, you  knew that we were going to buy only celery and rice  milk even be- fore you read it. As soon as I gave you the filter,  as soon as I said the  WHY, you knew exactly what decisions to make before  I said so.   That's called scale.   With a WHY clearly stated in an organization, anyon e within the  organization can make a decision as clearly and as accurately as the  founder. A WHY provides the clear filter for decisi on-making. Any  decisions—hiring, partnerships, strategies and tact ics—should all  pass the Celery Test.     The More Celery You Use, the More Trust You Earn   Mark Rubin is a good parent. He spends a lot of tim e with his two  daughters, Lucy and Sophie. One Saturday afternoon,  his wife,  Claudine, took Lucy to a friend's for a playdate an d Mark was left  home to look after five-year-old Sophie. Feeling a little tired, Mark  really wanted to just have a little time to relax o n the couch and not  ======================================== [Página 195] ======================================== COMMUNICATION IS NOT ABOUT SPEAKING, IT’S LISTENING   189 have to play tree house again for the ninth time th at day. To keep  Sophie occupied, he opted for the TV as babysitter.  Mark had two  brand-new DVDs to choose from. He'd seen neither of  them and  heard nothing about either of them in the press or from any of his  friends with small children. Mark didn't feel like watching the car- toon himself—the plan was to let Sophie enjoy the m ovie in one  room while he watched something in the other room. One of the  DVDs was from some company he'd never heard of and the other  was from Disney. Which one did he put in the DVD pl ayer? Which  one would you put in the DVD player?   The answer is so clear it verges on a silly questio n, but let's con- sider the facts for fun. Both DVDs were cartoons. B oth were age-  appropriate for a child. Both had a couple of good reviews on the  packaging. The only difference is that we trust the  DVD from Dis- ney. Disney is not a perfect company. They occasion ally have man- agement and leadership issues. Their stock price so metimes goes  down. They have lawsuits filed against them all the  time. Some  would lump them in with all the other nasty corpora tions that work  to appease Wall Street. So why would we trust them?   Disney operates with a clear sense of WHY—they exis t to pro- mote good, clean family fun and everything they say  and do has, for  decades, worked to prove it. The reason we trust Di sney is simple;  we know what they believe. They pass the Celery Tes t. They have  been so consistent over time in everything they say  and do that  parents trust them enough to expose their children to Disney  content without vetting it first. This has nothing to do with quality  products. This is not rational.   Southwest Airlines also passes the Celery Test. The  company has  been so consistent over time that we almost know wh at to expect  from them. The airline offers only open seating on its flights, for  example. It's one of the things they do to prove th at they believe in  freedom. It just makes sense. A company that serves  the common  ======================================== [Página 196] ======================================== START WITH WHY  190 man and values equality for all so much could never  have a class  structure. If Delta or United or Continental tried to do the same, it  wouldn't make sense, open seating doesn't fit their  way.   In Violation of Celery   Birkenstock sandals, tie-dyed T-shirts, daisy chain s and a VW van.  All are symbols of the hippie ideals of peace, love  and all things  vegetarian. So it was a bit of a surprise in 2004 w hen Volkswagen  introduced a $70,000 luxury model to their lineup. The company  famous for putting a vase for fresh flowers on the dashboard of their  new Beetle introduced the Phaeton in an attempt to compete with  high-end luxury cars, including the Mercedes-Benz S -Class and the  BMW 7 Series. The V-8,335-horsepower car boasted so me of the  most advanced features in the industry, like an air  compressor  suspension system and a draftless four-zone climate  control. It even  included an electronically controlled shiatsu massa ge system in the  seats. The car was an astounding achievement. It wa s very  comfortable and was a monster on the road, outperfo rming other  more established luxury cars in its class. The crit ics loved it. But  there was a small problem. Despite all the facts an d figures, features  and benefits, and regardless of the world-renowned German  engineering, few people bought one. It just didn't make sense. What  VW had done was inconsistent with what we knew them  to believe.   Volkswagen, which translated means "people's car," had spent  generations making cars for you and me. Everyone kn ew what VW  stood for—power to the people. It brought its cause  to life in prod- ucts that were all about quality that the average p erson could afford.  In a single swoop of German ingenuity, VW had been put  completely out of balance. This is not like Dell co ming out with an  mp3 player or United starting the low-cost airline Ted. In those  cases, we had no idea what the companies' WHYs were . Absent any  ======================================== [Página 197] ======================================== COMMUNICATION IS NOT ABOUT SPEAKING, IT’S LISTENING   191 knowledge or feeling for their WHY, we couldn't bri ng ourselves to  buy products from them that went anything beyond WH AT they  do. In this case, VW has a clear WHY, but WHAT they  produced  was completely misaligned. They failed the Celery T est.   Toyota and Honda knew this better than Volkswagen. When they  decided to add luxury models to their lineups, they  created new  brands, Lexus and Acura respectively, to do it. Toy ota had become a  symbol of efficiency and affordability to the gener al population.  They had built their business on a suite of low-cos t cars. They knew  that the market would not pay a premium for a luxur y car with the  same name or with the same logo on the hood. Althou gh a luxury  car, Lexus is still another WHAT to Toyota's WHY. I t still embodies  the same cause as the Toyota-branded cars, and the values of the  company are the same. The only difference is WHAT t hey are doing  to bring that cause to life.   The good news is, VW hasn't made the same mistake a gain, and  their WHY remains clear. But if a company tries too  many times to  "seize market opportunities" inconsistent with thei r WHY over time,  their WHY will go fuzzy and their ability to inspir e and command  loyalty will deteriorate.   What companies say and do matters. A lot. It is at the WHAT  level that a cause is brought to life. It is at thi s level that a company  speaks to the outside world and it is then that we can learn what the  company believes.      ======================================== [Página 198] ========================================   192  ======================================== [Página 199] ========================================   193 PART 5  THE BIGGEST  CHALLENGE  IS SUCCESS      ======================================== [Página 200] ========================================   194  ======================================== [Página 201] ========================================   195 11    WHEN WHY GOES FUZZY   Goliath Flinched   "A lot of what goes on these days with high-flying companies and  these overpaid CEOs, who're really just looting fro m the top and  aren't watching out for anybody but themselves, rea lly upsets me.  It's one of the main things wrong with American bus iness today."  This is the sentiment passed down from the founder of one of the  most vilified companies in recent history.   Raised on a farm in America's heartland, he came of  age during  the Great Depression. This probably explained his p redisposition for  frugality. Standing five feet nine inches and weigh ing only 130  pounds when he played football in high school, Sam Walton, the  founder of Wal-Mart, learned early the value of wor king hard.  Working hard leads to winning. And as the quarterba ck on his high  school football team, he won a lot. In fact, they w ent on to become  state champs. Whether through hard work, luck or ju st an unflap- pable optimism, Walton got so used to winning all t he time that he  couldn't fully visualize what losing looked like. H e simply couldn't  imagine it. Walton even philosophized that always t hinking about  winning probably became a self-fulfilling prophecy for him. Even  ======================================== [Página 202] ======================================== START WITH WHY  196 during the Depression, he had a highly successful p aper route that  earned him a decent wage for the times.   By the time Sam Walton died, he had taken Wal-Mart from a;  single store in Bentonville, Arkansas, and turned i t into a retail  colossus with $44 billion in annual sales with 40 m illion people  shopping in the stores per week. But it takes more than a competi- tive nature, a strong work ethic and a sense of opt imism to build a  company big enough to equal the twenty-third-larges t economy in  the world.   Walton wasn't the first person with big dreams to s tart a small  business. Many small business owners dream of makin g it big. I  meet a lot of entrepreneurs and it is amazing how m any of them tell  me their goal is to build a billion-dollar company.  The odds;  however, are significantly stacked against them. Th ere are 27.7  million registered businesses in the United States today and only a  thousand of them get to be FORTUNE 1000 companies, which these  days requires about $1.5 billion in annual revenues . That 1 means  that less than .004 percent of all companies make i t to the illustrious  list. To have such an impact, to build a company to  a size where it  can drive markets, requires something more.   Sam Walton did not invent the low-cost shopping mod el. The  five-and-dime variety store concept had existed for  decades and  Kmart and Target opened their doors the same year a s Wal-Mart, in  1962. Discounting was already a $2 billion industry  when Walton  decided to build his first Wal-Mart. There was plen ty of competition  beyond Kmart and Target, some of it much better fun ded and with  better locations and seemingly better opportunities  for success than  Wal-Mart. Sam Walton didn't even invent a better wa y of doing  things than everyone else. He admitted to "borrowin g" many, of his  ideas about the business from Sol Price, the founde r of Fed- Mart, a  retail discounter founded in Southern California du ring the 1950s.   ======================================== [Página 203] ======================================== WHEN WHY GOES FUZZY  197 Wal-Mart was not the only retail establishment capa ble of offering  low prices either. Price, as we've already establis hed, is a highly  effective manipulation. But it alone does not inspi re people to root  for you and give you the undying loyalty needed to create a tipping  point to grow to massive proportions. Being cheap d oes not inspire  employees to give their blood, sweat and tears. Wal -Mart did not  have a lock on cheap prices and cheap prices are no t what made it  so beloved and ultimately so successful.   For Sam Walton, there was something else, a deeper purpose,  cause or belief that drove him. More than anything else, Walton  believed in people. He believed that if he looked a fter people,  people would look after him. The more Wal-Mart coul d give to  employees, customers and the community, the more th at employ- ees, customers and the community would give back to  Wal-Mart.  "We're all working together; that's the secret," sa id Walton.   This was a much bigger concept than simply "passing  on the  savings." To Walton, the inspiration came not simpl y from customer  service but from service itself. Wal-Mart was WHAT Walton built to  serve his fellow human beings. To serve the communi ty, to serve  employees and to serve customers. Service was a hig her cause.   The problem was that his cause was not clearly hand ed down  after he died. In the post-Sam era, Wal-Mart slowly  started to  confuse WHY it existed—to serve people—with HOW it did  business—to offer low prices. They traded the inspi ring cause of  serving people for a manipulation. They forgot Walt on's WHY and  their driving motivation became all about "cheap." In stark contrast  to the founding cause that Wal-Mart originally embo died, efficiency  and margins became the name of the game. "A compute r can tell  you down to the dime what you've sold, but it can n ever tell you  how much you could have sold," said Walton. There i s always a  price to pay for the money you make, and given Wal- Mart's sheer  size, that cost wasn't paid in dollars and cents al one. In Wal-Mart's  ======================================== [Página 204] ======================================== START WITH WHY  198 case, forgetting their founder's WHY has come at a very high human  cost. Ironic, considering the company's founding ca use.   The company once renowned for how it treated employ ees and  customers has been scandal-ridden for nearly a deca de. Nearly  every scandal has centered on how poorly they treat  their customers  and their employees. As of December 2008, Wal-Mart faced seventy- three class-action lawsuits related to wage violati ons and' has  already paid hundreds of millions of dollars in pas t judgments and  settlements. A company that believed in the symbiot ic relationship  between corporation and community managed to drive for wedge  between themselves and so many of the communities w hich they  operate. There was a time when legislators would he lp pass laws to  allow Wal-Mart into new communities; now lawmakers rally to  keep them out. Fights to block Wal-Mart from openin g new stores  have erupted across the country. In New York, for e xample, city  representatives in Brooklyn joined forces with labo r unions to block  the store because of Wal-Mart's reputation for unfa ir labor practices.   In one of the more ironic violations of Walton's fo unding beliefs,  Wal-Mart has been unable to laugh at itself or lear n from its  scandals. "Celebrate your successes," said Walton. "Find some  humor in your failures. Don't take yourself so seri ously. Loosen up  and everybody around you will loosen up." Instead o f admitting  that things aren't what they used to be, Wal-Mart h as done the  opposite.   The way Wal-Mart thinks, acts and communicates sinc e the  passing of their inspired leader is not a result of  their competitor  outsmarting them either. Kmart filed for Chapter 11  bankruptcy   protection in 2002, and then merged with Sears thre e years later.  With about $400 billion in annual sales, Wal-Mart s till sells more  than six times as much as Target each year. In fact , looking beyond  discount retailing, Wal-Mart is now the largest sup ermarket in the  world and sells more DVDs, bicycles and toys than a ny other  ======================================== [Página 205] ======================================== WHEN WHY GOES FUZZY  199 company in America. Outside competition is not what 's hurting  their company. The greatest challenge W al-Mart has faced over the  year comes from one place: itself.   For Wal-Mart, WHAT they do and HOW they are doing i t; hasn't  changed. And it has nothing to do with Wal-Mart bei ng  "corporation"; they were one of those before the lo ve started decline.  What has changed is that their WHY went fuzzy. And we all know  it. A company once so loved is simply not as loved any-1  more. The negative feelings we have for the company  are real, but  the part of the brain that is able to explain why w e feel so negatively  toward them has trouble explaining what changed. So  we rational- ize and point to the most tangible things we can se e—size and  money. If we, as outsiders, have lost clarity of Wa l-Mart's WHY, it's  a good sign that the WHY has gone fuzzy inside the company also.  If it's not clear on the inside, it will never be c lear on the outside.  What is clear is that the Wal-Mart of today is not the Wal-Mart that  Sam Walton built. So what happened?   It's too easy to say that all they care about is th eir bottom line. All  companies are in business to make money, but being successful at it  is not the reason why things change so drastically.  That only points  to a symptom. Without understanding the reason it h appened in the  first place, the pattern will repeat for every othe r company that  makes it big. It is not destiny or some mystical bu siness cycle that  transforms successful companies into impersonal gol iaths. It's  people.   Being Successful vs. Feeling Successful   Every year a group of high-performing entrepreneurs  get  together at MIT's Endicott House just outside Bosto n. This  Gathering of Titans, as they call themselves, is no t your average  entrepreneurial conference. It's not a boondoggle. There's no golf,  there's no spa and there are no expensive dinners. Every year forty  ======================================== [Página 206] ======================================== START WITH WHY  200 to fifty business owners spend four days listening,  from early in the  morning until well into the evening. An assortment of guest  speakers is invited to present their thinking and i deas, and then  there are discussions led by some of the attendees.   I had the honor of attending the Gathering of Titan s as a guest a  few years ago. I expected it to be another group of  entrepreneurs  getting together to talk shop. I expected to hear d iscussions and  presentations about maximizing profits and improvin g systems. But  what I witnessed was profoundly different. In fact,  it was the  complete opposite.   On the first day, someone asked the group how many of them  had achieved their financial goals. About 80 percen t of the hands  went up. I thought that alone was quite impressive.  But it was the  answer to the next question that was so profound. W ith their hands  still in the air, the group was then asked, "How ma ny of you fed  successful?" And 80 percent of the hands went down.   Here was a room full of some of America's brightest  entrepre- neurs, many of them multimillionaires, some of whom  don't need to  work anymore if they don't want to, yet most of the m still didn't feel  like they had succeeded. In fact, many of them repo rted that they'd  lost something since they started their businesses.  They reminisced  about the days when they didn't have any money and were working  out of their basements, trying to get things going.  They longed for  the feeling they used to have.   These amazing entrepreneurs were at a point in thei r lives where  they realized that their businesses were about much  more than sell- ing stuff or making money. They realized the deep p ersonal  connection that existed between WHAT they do and WH Y they  were doing it. This group of entrepreneurs gathered  to discuss  matters of WHY, and at times it was quite intense.   Unlike the typical Type-A-personality entrepreneurs , the Titans  were not there to prove anything to each other. The re was a feeling  ======================================== [Página 207] ======================================== WHEN WHY GOES FUZZY  201 of immense trust rather than ruthless competition. And because of  this feeling, every member of the group was willing  to express vul- nerability that they probably rarely let show the r est of the year.  Over the course of the event, every person in the r oom would shed a  tear or two at least once.   It doesn't interest me to write about the idea that  money doesn't  buy happiness, or in this case, the feeling of succ ess. This is neither  profound nor a new idea. What does interest me, how ever, is the  transition that these entrepreneurs went through. A s their com- panies grew, and they became more and more successf ul, what  changed?   It is easy to see what they gained over the course of their careers— we can easily count the money, the size of the offi ce, the number of  employees, the size of their homes, market share an d the number of  press clippings. But the thing they had lost is muc h harder to  identify. As their tangible success grew, something  more elusive  started to dissipate. Every single one of these suc cessful business  owners knew WHAT they did. They knew HOW they did i t. But for  many, they no longer knew WHY.   Achievement vs. Success   For some people, there is an irony to success. Many  people who  achieve great success don't always feel it. Some wh o achieve fame  talk about the loneliness that often goes with it. That's because suc- cess and achievement are not the same thing, yet to o often we mis- take one for the other. Achievement is something yo u reach or  attain, like a goal. It is something tangible, clea rly defined and mea- surable. Success, in contrast, is a feeling or a st ate of being. "She feels  successful. She  is  successful," we say, using the verb  to be  to suggest  this state of  being.  While we can easily lay down a path to reach a  goal, laying down a path to reach that intangible f eeling of success is  more elusive. In my vernacular, achievement comes w hen you  ======================================== [Página 208] ======================================== START WITH WHY  202 pursue and attain WHAT you want. Success comes when  you are  clear in pursuit of WHY you want it. The former is motivated by  tangible factors while the latter by something deep er in the brain,  where we lack the capacity to put those feelings in to words.   Success comes when we wake up every day in that nev er-ending  pursuit of WHY we do WHAT we do. Our achievements, WHAT  we do, serve as the milestones to indicate we are o n the right path. It  is not an either/or—we need both. A wise man once s aid, "Money  can't buy happiness, but it pays for the yacht to p ull alongside it."  There is great truth in this statement. The yacht r epresents  achievement; it is easily seen and, with the right plan, completely  attainable. The thing we pull alongside represents that hard-to-  define feeling of success. Obviously, this is much harder to see and  attain. They are distinct concepts, and sometimes t hey go together  and sometimes they don't. More importantly, some pe ople, while in  pursuit of success, simply mistake WHAT they achiev e as the final  destination. This is the reason they never feel sat isfied no matter  how big their yacht is, no matter how much they ach ieve. The false  assumption we often make is that if we simply achie ve more, the  feeling of success will follow. But it rarely does.   In the course of building a business or a career, w e become more  confident in WHAT we do. We become greater experts in HOW to  do it. With each achievement, the tangible measurem ents of success  and the feeling of progress increase. Life is good.  However, for most  of us, somewhere in the journey we forget WHY we se t out on the  journey in the first place. Somewhere in the course  of all those  achievements an inevitable split happens. This is t rue for  individuals and organizations alike. What the Endic ott entrepre- neurs experienced as individuals was the same trans ition that Wal-  Mart and other big companies either have gone throu gh or are  going through. Because Wal-Mart operates at such an  immense  ======================================== [Página 209] ======================================== WHEN WHY GOES FUZZY  203 scale, the impact of their fuzzy WHY is felt on a g reater scale. Em- ployees, customers and the community will feel it a lso.   Those with an ability to never lose sight of WHY, n o matter how  little or how much they achieve, can inspire us. Th ose with the  ability to never lose sight of WHY and also achieve  the milestones  that keep everyone focused in the right direction a re the great lead- ers. For great leaders, The Golden Circle is in bal ance. They are in  pursuit of WHY, they hold themselves accountable to  HOW they do  it and WHAT they do serves as the tangible proof of  what they  believe. But most of us, unfortunately, reach a pla ce where WHAT  we are doing and WHY we are  doing it  eventually fall out of balance.  We get to a point when WHY and WHAT are not aligned . It is the  separation of the tangible and the intangible that marks the split.    ======================================== [Página 210] ========================================   204   ======================================== [Página 211] ========================================   205 12    SPLIT HAPPENS   Wal-Mart started small. So did Microsoft. So did Ap ple. So did  General Electric and Ford and almost every other co mpany that  made it big. They didn't start by acquisition or sp in-off, or achieve  mass scale overnight. Nearly every company or organ ization starts  the same way: with an idea. No matter whether an or ganization  grows to become a multibillion-dollar corporation l ike Wal-Mart or  fails in the first few years, most of them started with a single person  or small group of people who had an idea. Even the United States of  America started the same way.   At the beginning, ideas are fueled by passion—that very com- pelling emotion that causes us to do quite irration al things. That  passion drives many people to make sacrifices so th at a cause bigger  than themselves can be brought to life. Some drop o ut of school or  quit a perfectly good job with a good salary and be nefits to try to go  it alone. Some work extraordinarily long hours with out a second  thought, sometimes sacrificing the stability of the ir relationships or  even their personal health. This passion is so into xicating and  exciting that it can affect others as well. Inspire d by the founder's  vision, many early employees demonstrate classic ea rly- adopter  behavior. Relying on their gut, these first employe es also quit their  ======================================== [Página 212] ======================================== START WITH WHY  206 perfectly good jobs and accept lower salaries to jo in an organization  with a 90 percent statistical chance of failing. Bu t the statistics don't  matter; passion and optimism reign and energy is hi gh. Like all  early adopters, the behavior of those who join earl y says more about  them than it does about the company's prospects.   The reason so many small businesses fail, however, is because  passion alone can't cut it. For passion to survive,  it needs structure.  A WHY without the HOWs, passion without structure, has a very  high probability of failure. Remember the dot-com b oom? Lots of  passion, but not so much structure. The Titans at E ndicott House,  however, did not face this problem. They knew how t o build the  systems and processes to see their companies grow. They are among  the statistical 10 percent of small businesses that  didn't fail in their  first three years. In fact, many of them went on to  do quite well.  Their challenge was different. Passion may need str ucture to sur- vive, but for structure to grow, it needs passion.   This is what I witnessed at the Gathering of Titans : I saw a room  full of people with passion enough to start busines ses, and with  knowledge enough to build the systems and structure s to survive  and even do very well. But having spent so many yea rs focused on  converting a vision into a viable business, many st arted to fixate on  WHAT the organization did or HOW to do it. Poring o ver financial  or some other easily measured result, and fixating on HOW they  were to achieve those tangible results, they stoppe d focusing on  WHY they started the business in the first place. T his is also what  has happened at Wal-Mart. A company obsessed with s erving the  community became obsessed with achieving its goals.   Like Wal-Mart, the Endicott entrepreneurs used to t hink, act and  communicate from the inside out of The Golden Circl e—5 from  WHY to WHAT. But as they grew more successful, the process  reversed. WHAT now comes first and all their system s and pro- cesses are in pursuit of those tangible results. Th e reason the change  ======================================== [Página 213] ======================================== SPLIT HAPPENS  207 happened is simple—they suffered a split and their WHY went  fuzzy.     The single greatest challenge any organization will  face is . . .  success. When the company is small, the founder wil l rely on his gut  to make all the major decisions. From marketing to product, from  strategy to tactics, hiring and firing, the decisio ns the founder makes  will, if he trusts his gut, feel right. But as the organization grows, as  it becomes more successful, it becomes physically i mpossible for one  person to make every major decision. Not only must others be  trusted and relied upon to make big decisions, but those people will  also start making hiring choices. And slowly but su rely, as the  megaphone grows, the clarity of WHY starts to dilut e.   Whereas gut was the filter for early decisions, rat ional cases and  empirical data often serve as the sole basis for la ter decisions. For all  organizations that go through the split, they are n o longer inspired  by a cause greater than themselves. They simply com e to work,  manage systems and work to reach certain preset goa ls. There is no  longer a cathedral to build. The passion is gone an d inspiration is at  a minimum. At that point, for most who show up ever y day what  they do is just a job. If this is how the people on  the inside feel,  imagine how those on the outside feel. It is no won der that    ======================================== [Página 214] ======================================== START WITH WHY  208 manipulations start to dominate not only how the co mpany sells its  wares, but even how they retain employees. Bonuses,  promotions  and other enticements, even instilling fear in peop le, become the  only way to hold on to talent. That's hardly inspir ing.   This diagram depicts the life of an organization. T he top line  represents the growth of WHAT the organization does . For a  company, that measurement is usually money—profits,  revenues,  EBITA, share price or growth in market share. But t he metric can be  anything, depending on what the organization does. If the  organization rescues lost puppies, then the metric would be the  number of puppies successfully rescued. It is inher ently simple to  measure the growth of WHAT an organization does. WH ATs, after  all, are tangible and easy to count.   The second line represents the WHY, the clarity of the founding;  purpose, cause or belief. The goal is to ensure tha t as the  measurement of WHAT grows, the clarity of the WHY s tays closely  aligned. Put another way, as the volume of the mega phone  increases, the message traveling through it must st ay clear.   The volume of the megaphone comes solely from growt h  of   WHAT. As this metric grows, any company can become a "leading"  company. But it is the ability to inspire, to maint ain clarity of WHY,  that gives only a few people and organizations the ability to lead.  The moment at which the clarity of WHY starts to go  fuzzy is the  split. At this point organizations may be loud, but  they are no longer  clear.   When organizations are small, WHAT they do and WHY they do  it are in close parallel. Born out of the personali ty of the founder it is  relatively easy for early employees to "get it." Cl arity of WHY  understood because the source of passion is near—in  fact it  physically comes to work every day. In most small b usinesses all the  employees are all crammed into the same room and so cialize  together. Simply being around a charismatic founder  allows that   ======================================== [Página 215] ======================================== SPLIT HAPPENS  209 feeling of being a part of something special to flo urish. Although  they may be some efficiencies to be gained, for sma ll businesses that  at perfectly comfortable staying small, the need to  articulate the  WHY is not as important. For organizations that wan t to pass the  School Bus Test, to become billion-dollar organizat ions or work at a  scale large enough to shift markets or society, the  need to manage  through the split is paramount.   The School Bus Test is a simple metaphor. If a foun der or leader  of an organization were to be hit by a school bus, would the orga- nization continue to thrive at the same pace withou t them at the  helm? So many organizations are built on the force of a single per- sonality that their departure can cause significant  disruption. The  question isn't if it happens—all founders eventuall y leave or die—  it's just a question of when and how prepared the o rganization is for  the inevitable departure. The challenge isn't to cl ing to the leader; it's  to find effective ways to keep the founding vision alive forever.   To pass the School Bus Test, for an organization to  continue to  inspire and lead beyond the lifetime of its founder , the founder's  WHY must be extracted and integrated into the cultu re of the  company. What's more, a strong succession plan shou ld aim to find  a leader inspired by the founding cause and ready t o lead it into the  next generation. Future leaders and employees alike  must be in- spired by something bigger than the force of person ality of the  founder and must see beyond profit and shareholder value alone.   Microsoft has experienced a split, but is not so fa r down the line  that it can't be put back on track. There was a tim e not too long ago  that people at Microsoft showed up at work every da y to change the  world. And they did. What Microsoft achieved, putti ng a PC on  every desk, dramatically changed the way we live. B ut then their  WHY went fuzzy. Few people at the company today are  instructed  to do everything they can to help people be more pr oductive so that  ======================================== [Página 216] ======================================== START WITH WHY  210 they can achieve their greatest potential. Instead,  Microsoft became  just a software company.   If you visit Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, W ashington,  you will find that although their WHY has gone fuzz y, it is not lost.  That sense of a cause, that desire to change the wo rld again, is still  there, but it has become unfocused, wrapped up in H OW and  WHAT they do. Microsoft has a remarkable opportunit y to clarify  their WHY and regain the inspiration that took them  to where they  are today. If they do not, if all they do is manage  the WHAT and  continue to ignore the WHY, they will end up lookin g like America  Online, a company so far past the split that their WHY is indeed  lost. There is barely a hint of the original WHY le ft anymore.   America Online used to inspire. Like Google today, it was the  hot company to work for. People clamored to move to  Virginia to  work for this amazing company that was changing the  rules of  business. And it was true that, like all inspiring companies, AOL set  in motion changes that profoundly altered how we do  almost ev- erything. They inspired a nation to get online. The ir cause was clear  and their decisions were governed by their WHY. The ir goal was to  get more people online, even if their decisions in pursuit of that goal  wreaked havoc on their business in the short term. With their WHY  in focus, AOL pulled ahead of their competition by deciding to  change from hourly pricing for Internet access to u nlimited monthly  pricing, a decision that created so much traffic it  shut down their  servers. Given the impact, the decision was neither  practical nor  rational, but it was the right choice to help bring  their cause to life.  That their systems shut down with the additional tr affic only  pushed them to work harder to cope with it, to ensu re that America  could, in fact, get and stay online.   In those days, having an AOL e-mail address was a p oint of  pride—a sign of being one of those who was a part o f the Internet  revolution. These days, still having an AOL e-mail address is a sym- ======================================== [Página 217] ======================================== SPLIT HAPPENS  211 bol of having been left behind. That the meaning of  something as  simple as  @aol.com  has changed so dramatically is additional proof  that the company's cause has long since departed. A bsent a clear  WHY, size and momentum are all AOL has to keep them  going. The  company is not inspiring anymore, not to those who work there and  not to those on the outside. We don't talk about th em like we used  to and we certainly don't feel the same way about t hem either. We  don't compare them to Google or Facebook or any of the other  industry-changing companies of today. Like a massiv e freight train  with brakes applied, it will still take miles for t his train to come to a  complete stop. It's simple physics. At best AOL's s ize will help them  putter along, but without a more compelling purpose , cause or  belief, the company is simply a collection of stuff . It will probably  end up being chopped up and sold off for scrap (tec hnology or  customers), which is a sad reality considering how inspiring AOL  used to be.   It is not a coincidence that successful entrepreneu rs long for the  early days. It is no accident that big companies ta lk about a "return  to basics." What they are alluding to is a time bef ore the split. And  they would be right. They do indeed need to return to a time when  WHAT they did was in perfect parallel to WHY they d id it. If they  continue down the path of focusing on their growth of WHAT at the  expense of WHY—more volume and less clarity—their a bility to  thrive and inspire for years to come is dubious at best. Companies  like Wal-Mart, Microsoft, Starbucks, the Gap, Dell and so many  others that used to be special have all gone throug h a split. If they  cannot recapture their WHY and reinspire those insi de and outside  their organization, every one of them will end up l ooking more like  AOL than the companies they were.     ======================================== [Página 218] ======================================== START WITH WHY  212 What Gets Measured, Gets Done   In the fall of her freshman year in college, Christ ina Harbridge set  out to find a part-time job. Intrigued by the prosp ect of working in  the antiques business, she answered a newspaper ad in Sacramento  to do office work for a "collector." Harbridge soon  found out, how- ever, that the job was filing papers for a collecti ons agent, and even  then she wasn't entirely sure what that meant.   The collections office consisted of a huge room wit h dozens of  phone stations, each staffed by a debt collector ma king call after call  to a long list of businesses and individuals who ow ed money. The  setup of the room meant there was no privacy—everyo ne could  hear everyone else's calls. Harbridge was immediate ly taken by the  harshness of the tone that all the collectors used with those from  whom they aimed to collect unpaid debts. "They woul d hound  them, and practically threaten them," she said. "Th ey would do  anything it took to get information from them."   Harbridge recognized that the owner of the company and  collectors were all kind, gracious people. They hel ped each other  out, listened to each other's problems and even joi ned together  sponsor a homeless family during the holidays. But when they wait  on the phone to collect a debt, these same people t urned passive- aggressive, rude and often mean. It's not because t hey were bad  people, it's because they were incentivized to be t hat way.   Their officious behavior made perfect sense. "What gets  measured gets done," as well-known sales coach Jack  Daly says.  And ii| the world of debt collecting, the callers w ere given bonuses  b on how much money they collected. This has result ed in any  industry that threatens, badgers, hounds and provok es. It did take  long until Harbridge found herself adopting the sam e attitude  whenever she talked with debtors. "I began treating  people on the  phone the way everybody else in the office treated them," she sail   ======================================== [Página 219] ======================================== SPLIT HAPPENS  213 Feeling like WHAT she was doing was completely out of balance  with her WHY, Harbridge decided there had to be ano ther way to  go in my head that I was going to start an agency t hat collected by  being nice," she said. People in the collections bu siness though  Harbridge naive, if not crazy. And maybe she was.   In 1993, Harbridge moved to San Francisco and start ed her own  collections firm, Bridgeport Financial, steeped in the belief that  agents would have more success treating people with  respect that  badgering them. Harbridge built her company on her WHY—that  everyone has a story and everyone deserves to be li stened to Her  approach was to have her agents try to establish ra pport with the  debtor on the other end of the phone in the course of a three minute  conversation. The goal was to learn everything they  could about the  person's circumstances: Did they have the means to pa] the debt?  Would they honor a payment plan? Was the reason for  the failure to  pay reflective of a short-term situation? "We would  get people to tell  us the truth," she said. "Sure, we had a legal depa rtment, but we  tried to avoid using it." Harbridge knew, however, that no matter  her intentions, if she measured the results the sam e was as others,  the same awful behavior would result. So she came w ith an entirely  new way to incentivize her people. She found a way to measure  WHY.   At Bridgeport Financial, bonuses were not given for  the amount  of money that was collected; they were given based on how many  "thank you" cards her agents sent out. This is hard er than it sounds.  Sending out a card thanking someone for the time th ey spent talking  on the phone requires a few things. First, Harbridg e had to hire  people who believed what she believed. She had to h ire good fits. If  her employees didn't believe that everyone deserves  to be listened  to, it wouldn't work. Only good-fit hires would be capable of creat- ing an environment on the telephone that would actu ally warrant  sending a thank-you card, even though the purpose o f the call was  ======================================== [Página 220] ======================================== START WITH WHY  214 to ask for money. Harbridge measured WHY her compan y existed,  not WHAT they did, and the result was a culture in which compas- sion was valued above all.   But what about the other results? What about her fi nancial re- sults, the ones most businesses pursue first? Bridg eport Financial  collected 300 percent more than the industry averag e. What's more,  most of the people and companies who were initially  being pursued  ended up doing more business with the original comp any that sent  the collections agency after them in the first plac e. This is almost  unprecedented in the collections industry.   Harbridge's business succeeded not just because she  knew WHY  she was doing what she was doing, but because she f ound a way to  measure the WHY. The company's growth was loud and her cause  was clear. She started with WHY and the rest follow ed.   Most organizations today use very clear metrics to track the  progress and growth of WHAT they do—usually it's mo ney. Un- fortunately, we have very poor measurements to ensu re that a WHY  stays clear. Dwayne Honore has for the past ten yea rs run his own  commercial construction company in Baton Rouge, Lou isiana, a  trade he learned from his father.

Stay  any later and they are taken out of a bonus pool. B ecause employees  know they have to leave by 5:30 p.m., wasted time h as dropped to a  minimum. Productivity is high and turnover in low. Consider how  ======================================== [Página 221] ======================================== SPLIT HAPPENS  215 much you get done the day before you go on vacation . Now  imagine every day is like that. That's what Dwayne Honore figured  out how to do. Because he figured out how to mea$ s ure a value he  holds dear, that value is embraced. Most importantl y, because  Honore's actions pass the Celery Test, others can c learly see what he  believes.   Money is a perfectly legitimate measurement of good s sold or  services rendered. But it is no calculation of valu e. Just because  somebody makes a lot of money does not mean that he  necessarily  provides a lot of value. Likewise, just because som ebody makes  little money does not necessarily mean he provides only a little  value. Simply by measuring the number of goods sold  or the money  brought in is no indication of value. Value is a fe eling, not a  calculation. It is perception. One could argue that  a product with  more bells and whistles that sells for less is the greater value. But by  who’s standard?   My uncle used to make tennis rackets. His rackets w ere made the  exact same factory as a name-brand racket. They wer e made of the  same material on the same machine. The only differe nce with that  when my uncle's rackets came off the assembly line,  they didn’t put  the well-known brand logo on the product. My uncle' s racked sold  for less money, in the same big-box retailer, next to the name brand  rackets. Month after month, the name-brand rackets outsold the  generic-brand ones. Why? Because people perceived g reater value  from the name-brand rackets and felt just fine payi ng a premium for  that feeling. On a strictly rational scale, the gen eric rackets offered  better value. But again, value is a perception, not  a calculation,  which is the reason companies make such a big deal about investing  in their brand. But a strong brand, like all other intangible factors  that contribute to the perception of value, starts with a clear sense of  WHY.   ======================================== [Página 222] ======================================== START WITH WHY  216 If those outside the megaphone share your WHY and i f you are  able to clearly communicate that belief in everythi ng you say and  do, trust emerges and value is perceived. When that  happens, loyal  buyers will always rationalize the premium they pay  or the incon- venience they suffer to get that feeling. To them, the sacrifice of time  or money is worth it. They will try to explain that  their feeling of  value comes from quality or features or some other easy-to- point-to  element, but it doesn't. Those are external factors  and the  feeling  they  get comes completely from inside them. When people can point to a  company and clearly articulate what the company bel ieves and use  words unrelated to price, quality, service and feat ures, that is proof  the company has successfully navigated the split. W hen people  describe the value they perceive with visceral, exc ited words like  "love," that is a sure sign that a clear sense of W HY exists.   Good Successions Keep the WHY Alive   There were three words missing from Bill Gates's go odbye speech  when he officially left Microsoft in June 2008. The y are three words  he probably doesn't even realize need to be there.   "I'll be back."   Though Gates abdicated his role as CEO of Microsoft  to Steve  Ballmer in 2000 to lend more time and energy to the  Bill and  Melinda Gates Foundation, he still maintained a rol e and a presence  at the Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washingto n. His plan  was always to completely leave the company in the c are of others,  but like a lot of founders, Gates forgot to do one thing that would  allow his plan to work. This one oversight could ha ve a devastating  impact on Microsoft and may even require him to com e back  someday to right the ship he built.   Bill Gates is special. Not just because of his brai n or his  management style. Though important, those two thing s alone are  ======================================== [Página 223] ======================================== SPLIT HAPPENS  217 not the formula for building a $60 billion corporat ion from scratch.  Like all visionary leaders, Bill Gates is special b ecause he embodies  what he believes. He is the personification of Micr osoft's WHY. And  for that reason, he serves as a physical beacon, a reminder of WHY  everyone comes to work.   When Gates founded Microsoft with Paul Allen in 197 5, he did  so to advance a higher cause: if you give people th e right tools, and  make them more productive, then everyone, no matter  their lot in  life, will have an opportunity to achieve their rea l potential, "A PC  in every home and on every desk," he envisioned; re markable from  a company that didn't even make PCs. He saw the PC as the great  equalizer. Microsoft's most successful software, Wi ndows, allowed  anyone to have access to powerful technology. Tools  like Word,  Excel and PowerPoint gave everyone the power to rea lize the  promise of the new technology—to become more effici ent and  productive. Small businesses, for example, could lo ok and act like  big businesses. Microsoft's software helped Gates a dvance his cause  to empower the "everyman."   Make no mistake, Microsoft has done more to change the world  than Apple. Though we are drawn to Apple's well-des erved rep- utation for innovation and challenging the business  models of more  than one industry, it is Microsoft that was respons ible for the  advancement of the personal computer. Gates put a P C on every  desk and in doing so he changed the world. As the p hysical em- bodiment of the company's WHY, the "everyman" who f ulfilled an  amazing potential, what happens now that he's gone?   Gates himself has always held that he receives a "d isproportionate"  amount of attention for his role at Microsoft, much  of it, of course,  due to his exceptional wealth. Like all inspired le aders, he  recognizes that his role is to lead the cause, but it is others who will  be physically responsible for bringing that cause t o life. Martin Lu- ther King Jr. could not have changed America walkin g across a  ======================================== [Página 224] ======================================== START WITH WHY  218 bridge in Selma, Alabama, with five prominent civil  rights leaders.  It took the thousands of people marching behind the m to spur  change. Gates recognizes the need for people to pro duce real  change, but he neglected to remember that any effec tive movement,  social or business, needs a leader to march in the front, preaching  the vision and reminding people WHY they showed up in the first  place. Though King needed to cross the bridge from Selma on his  march to Montgomery, it was what it meant to cross the bridge that  mattered. Likewise in business, though profit and s hareholder value  are valid and essential destinations, they do not i nspire people to  come to work.   Although Microsoft went through the split years ago , changing  from a company that intended to change the world in to a company  that makes software, having Gates hanging around he lped Micro- soft maintain at least a loose sense of WHY they ex isted. With Gates  gone, Microsoft does not have sufficient systems to  measure and  preach their WHY anymore. This is an issue that wil l have an ex- ponential impact as time passes.   Such a departure as Gates's is not without preceden t among  companies with equally visionary leaders. Steve Job s, the physical  embodiment of the rabble-rousing revolutionary, a m an who also  personifies his company's WHY, left Apple in 1985 a fter a legendary  power struggle with Apple's president, John Sculley , and the Apple  board of directors. The impact on Apple was profoun d.   Originally hired by Jobs in 1983, Sculley was a per fectly capable  executive with a proven track record. He know WHAT to do and  HOW to do things. He was considered one of the most  talented  marketing executives around, having risen quickly t hrough the  ranks of PepsiCo. At Pepsi, he created the wildly s uccessful Pepsi  Challenge taste test advertising campaign, leading Pepsi to overtake  Coca-Cola for the first time. But the problem was, Sculley was a bad  ======================================== [Página 225] ======================================== SPLIT HAPPENS  219 fit at Apple. He ran the company as a business and was not there to  lead the cause.   It is worth considering how such a bad fit as Scull ey even got the  job at Apple in the first place. Simple—he was mani pulated. Sculley  did not approach Jobs and ask to be a part of Apple 's cause. The  way the real story unfolded made the fallout almost  predictably  Jobs knew he needed help. He knew he needed a HOW g uy to help  him scale his vision. He approached Sculley, a man with a solid  r£sum6, and said, "Do you want to sell sugar water your whole life  or do you want to change the world?" Playing off Sc ulley's ego  aspirations and fears, Jobs completed a perfectly e xecuted manipu- lation. And with it, Jobs was ousted from his own c ompany a fen*  years later.   Apple thrived on Steve Jobs's fumes for a few years  as businesses  started buying up Macintoshes and software develope rs continued  to create new software. But it wouldn't be long unt il the company  would begin to falter. Apple just wasn't what it us ed to be. It had  gone through the split and ignored it. The WHY was getting fuzzier  and fuzzier with each passing year. The inspiration  was gone.  Literally.   With a capable executive like Sculley running the b usiness, there  was no one to lead the cause. New products would be  "less revolu- tionary and more evolutionary," reported  FORTUNE  magazine at  the time, "some people might even call them dull." Weary of Apple's  "right brain" ways, Sculley reorganized the company  repeatedly,  each time trying to get back what Apple clearly had  lost. He brought  in a new executive staff to help. But all they were  doing was trying  to manage HOW the company worked when it was the WH Y that  needed attention. Needless to say, morale was disma l. It wasn't until  Jobs returned in 1997 that everyone inside and outs ide the company  was reminded WHY Apple existed. With clarity back, the company  quickly reestablished its power for innovation, for  thinking different  ======================================== [Página 226] ======================================== START WITH WHY  220 and, once again, for redefining industries. With Jo bs at the helm  again, the culture for challenging the status quo, for empowering  the individual, returned. Every decision was filter ed through the  WHY, and it worked. Like most inspiring leaders, Jo bs trusted his  gut over outside advice. He was regularly criticize d for not making  mass-market decisions, such as letting people clone  the Mac. He  couldn't; those actions violated what he believed. They failed the  Celery Test.   When the person who personifies the WHY departs wit hout  clearly articulating WHY the company was founded in  the first  place, they leave no clear cause for their successo r to lead. The new  CEO will come aboard to run the company and will fo cus attention  on the growth of WHAT with little attention to WHY.  Worse, they  may try to implement their own vision without consi dering the  cause that originally inspired most people to show up in the first  place. In these cases, the leader can work against the culture of the  company instead of leading or building upon it. The  result is dimin- ished morale, mass exodus, poor performance and a s low and  steady transition to a culture of mistrust and ever y-man-for-himself.   It happened at Dell. Michael Dell, too, had a cause  when he  started his company. From the start, he focused on efficiency as a  way of getting more computing power into more hands . Unfortu- nately, it was a cause that he too forgot, and then  didn't communi- cate well enough before he stepped down as CEO of D ell Corp. in  July 2004. After the company started to weaken—cust omer service,  for one, plummeted—he came back in less than three years.   Michael Dell recognized that without him present to  keep energy  focused on the reason Dell Corp. was founded, the c ompany became  more obsessed with WHAT at the expense of WHY. "The  company  was too focused on the short term, and the balance of priorities was  way too leaning toward things that deliver short- t erm results—that  was the major root cause," Dell told the  New York Times  in  ======================================== [Página 227] ======================================== SPLIT HAPPENS  221 September 2007. The company had in fact become so d ysfunctional  that some managers were compelled to falsify earnin gs reports  between 2003 and 2006 in order to meet sales target s, suggesting a  corporate culture that put undue pressure on manage rs to meet  bottom-line targets. In the meantime, the company h ad missed  significant market shifts, most notably the potenti al of the consumer  market, and lost its edge with component suppliers as well. And in  2006, Hewlett-Packard swept past Dell as the larges t seller of PCs  worldwide. Dell had gone through the split and fail ed to recognize  the reason it wasn't the company it used to be.   Starbucks is another good example. In 2000, Howard Schultz  resigned as CEO of Starbucks, and for the first tim e in its history  and despite 50 million customers per week, the comp any started to  crack.   If you look back at the history of Starbucks, it th rived not be- cause of its coffee but because of the experience i t offered to cus- tomers. It was Schultz who brought that WHY to the company when  he arrived in 1982, ten years after Gordon Bowker, Jerry Baldwin  and Zev Siegl first started selling coffee beans in  Seattle. In the early  days it was about the coffee. Schultz, frustrated t hat the founders of  Starbucks couldn't see the larger vision, set out t o put the company  on a new course, the course that ultimately turned Starbucks into  the company we know today. Schultz had been enamore d of the  espresso bars of Italy, and it was his vision of bu ilding a comfortable  environment between work and home, the "third space ," as he called  it, that allowed Starbucks to single-handedly creat e a coffee-shop  culture in the United States that had until then on ly existed on  college campuses.   That was the time when Starbucks stood for somethin g. It reflected  an underlying belief about the world. It was that i dea that people  bought, not the coffee. And it was inspiring. But S tarbucks, like so  many before it, went through the inevitable split. They, too, forgot  ======================================== [Página 228] ======================================== START WITH WHY  222 about WHY the company was founded and started focus ing on the  results and the products. There was a time when Sta rbucks offered  the option to sip your coffee out of a ceramic cup and eat your  Danish off a ceramic plate. Two perfect details tha t helped bring the  company's belief to life in the place between work and home. But  ceramic crockery is expensive to maintain and Starb ucks did away  with it, favoring the more efficient paper cups. Th ough it saved  money, it came at a cost: the erosion of trust. Not hing says to a  customer "We love you, now get out" like a paper cu p. It was no  longer about the third space. It had become about t he coffee.  Starbucks's WHY was going fuzzy. Thankfully, Schult z was there,  the physical embodiment of the WHY, to remind peopl e of the  higher cause. But in 2000 he left, and things got w orse.   The company had grown from fewer than 1,000 stores to 13,000  in only ten years. Eight years and two CEOs later, the company was  dangerously overextended just as it was facing an o nslaught of  competition from McDonald's, Dunkin' Donuts and oth er un- expected places. In a now famous memo that Schultz wrote to his  successor, Jim Donald, just months before returning  to take the  helm, he implored Donald to "make the changes neces sary to evoke  the heritage, the tradition and the passion that we  all have for the  true Starbucks experience." The reason the company was floun- dering was not that it grew too fast, but that Schu ltz had not prop- erly infused his WHY into the organization so that the organization  could manage the WHY without him. In early 2008, Sc hultz re- placed Donald with a leader who could better steer the company  back to a time before the split: himself.   None of these executives are considered God's gift to manage- ment. Steve Jobs's paranoia, for example, is well d ocumented, and  Bill Gates is socially awkward. Their companies are  thousands of  people deep and they alone can't pull all the strin gs or push all the  buttons to make everything work properly. They rely  on the brains  ======================================== [Página 229] ======================================== SPLIT HAPPENS  223 and the management skills of teams of people to hel p them build  their megaphones. They rely on people who share the ir cause. In  this respect, they are no different from other exec utives. But what  they all have in common, something that not all CEO s possess, is  that they physically embody the cause around which they built their  companies. Their physical presence reminds every ex ecutive and  every employee WHY they show up to work. Put simply : they in- spire. Yet, like Bill Gates, these inspired leaders  have all failed to  properly articulate their cause in words that other s could rally  around in their absence. Failing to put the movemen t into hard  words leaves them as the only ones who can lead the  movement.  What happens when Jobs or Dell or Schultz leave aga in?   For companies of any size, success is the greatest challenge. As   Microsoft grew, Gates stopped talking about what he  believed and !  how he was going to change the world and started ta lking about  what the company was doing. Microsoft changed. Foun ded as a  company that believed in making people more product ive so they  could achieve their highest potential, Microsoft be came a company  that simply made software products. Such a seemingl y subtle  change affects behaviors. It alters decisions. And it impacts how a  company structures itself for the future. Though Mi crosoft had  changed since its founding, the impact was never as  dramatic  because at least Bill Gates was there, the physical  embodiment of the  cause that inspired his executives and employees.   Microsoft is just one of the tangible things Gates has done in his  life to bring his cause to life. The company is one  of the WHATs to  his WHY. And now he's off to do something else that  also embodies  his cause—to use the Gates Foundation to help peopl e around the  world wake up every day to overcome obstacles so th ey too can  have an opportunity achieve their potential. The on ly difference is  he's not doing it with software anymore. Steve Ball mer, a smart man  by all accounts, does not physically embody Gates's  vision of the  ======================================== [Página 230] ======================================== START WITH WHY  224 world. He has the image of a powerful executive who  sees numbers,  competitors and markets. He is a man with a gift fo r managing the  WHAT line. Like John Sculley at Apple, Jim Donald a t Starbucks  and Kevin Rollins at Dell—all the CEOs who replaced  the visionary  founders or executives—Ballmer might be the perfect  man to work  alongside a visionary, but is he the perfect man to  replace one?   The entire culture of all these companies was built  around one  man's vision. The only succession plan that will wo rk is to find a  CEO who believes in and wants to continue to lead t hat movement,  not replace it with their own vision of the future.  Ballmer knows  how to rally the company, but can he inspire it?   Successful succession is more than selecting someon e with an  appropriate skill set—it's about finding someone wh o is in lockstep  with the original cause around which the company wa s founded.   Great second or third CEOs don't take the helm to i mplement their  own vision of the future; they pick up the original  banner and lead  the company into the next generation. That's why we  call it succes- sion, not replacement. There is a continuity of vis ion.   One of the reasons Southwest Airlines has been so g ood at suc- cession is because its cause is so ingrained in its  culture, and the  CEOs who took over from Herb Kelleher also embodied  the cause.  Howard Putnam was the first president of Southwest after Kelleher.  Though he was a career airline guy, it was not his resume that made  him so well suited to lead the company. He was a go od fit. Putnam  recounts the time he met with Kelleher to interview  for the job.  Putnam leaned back in his chair and noticed that Ke lleher had  slipped his shoes off under the desk. More signific antly, Putnam  noticed the hole in one of Kelleher's socks. It was  at that point that  Putnam felt he was the right man for the job. He lo ved that Kelleher  was just like everyone else. He too had holes in hi s socks.   Although Putnam felt Southwest was right for him, h ow do we  know if he was right for Southwest? I had a chance to spend half a  ======================================== [Página 231] ======================================== SPLIT HAPPENS  225 day with Putnam to talk. At one point in the aftern oon I suggested  we take a break and grab a Starbucks. The mere sugg estion in- censed him. "I'm not going to Starbucks!" he cracke d. "I'm not  paying five dollars for a cup of coffee. And what t he heck is a  Frappuccino anyway?" It was at that point I realize d how perfect a  fit Putnam was for Southwest. He was an everyman. A  Dunkin'  Donuts guy. He was a perfect man to take the torch from Kelleher  and charge forward. Southwest inspired him. In the case of Howard  Putnam, Kelleher hired somebody who could represent  the cause,  not reinvent it.   Today it has become so acculturated there that it's  almost automatic.  The same could be said for Colleen Barrett, who bec ame president  of Southwest in 2001, some thirty years after she w as working as  Kelleher's secretary in his San Antonio law firm. B y 2001, the  company had nearly 30,000 employees and a fleet of 344 planes. By  the time she took over, Barrett says that running t he company had  become "a very collective effort." Kelleher stopped  his day-to-day  involvement in the company, but left a corporate cu lture so strong  that his presence in the hallways was no longer nee ded. The  physical person had largely been replaced by the fo lklore of  Kelleher. But it is the folklore that has helped ke ep the WHY alive.  Barrett freely admits she's not the smartest execut ive out there. She  is self-deprecating in her personal assessment, in fact. But as the  leader of the company, being the smartest was not h er job. Her job  was to lead the cause. To personify the values and remind everyone  WHY they are there.   The good news is, it will be easy to know if a succ essor is carry- ing the right torch. Simply apply the Celery Test a nd see if what the  company is saying and doing makes sense. Test wheth er WHAT  they are doing effectively proves WHY they were fou nded. If we  can't easily assess a company's WHY simply from loo king at their  ======================================== [Página 232] ======================================== START WITH WHY  226 products, services, marketing and public statements , then odds are  high that they don't know what it is either. If the y did, so would we.   When the WHY Goes, WHAT Is All You'll Have Left   On April 5,1992, at approximately eight in the morn ing, Wal-Mart  lost its WHY. On that day, Sam Walton, Wal-Mart's i nspired leader,  the man who embodied the cause around which he buil t the world's  largest retailer, died in the University of Arkansa s Medical Science  Hospital in Little Rock of bone marrow cancer. Soon  after, Walton's  oldest son, S. Robeson Walton, who succeeded his fa ther as chair- man of the company, gave a public statement. "No ch anges are ex- pected in the corporate direction, control or polic y," he said. Sadly  for Wal-Mart employees, customers and shareholders,  that is not  what happened.   Sam Walton was the embodiment of the everyman. Thou gh he  was named the richest man in America by  Forbes  magazine in 1985,  a title he held until he died, he never understood the importance  others placed on money. Certainly, Walton was a com petitor, and  money was a good yardstick of success. But that's n ot what gave   Walton or those who worked at Wal-Mart the feeling of success. It  was people Walton valued above all else. People.   Look after people and people will look after you wa s his belief,  and everything Walton and Wal-Mart did proved it. I n the early  days, for example, Walton insisted on showing up fo r work on Sat- urdays out of fairness to his store employees who h ad to work  weekends. He remembered birthdays and anniversaries  and even  that a cashier's mother had just undergone gallblad der surgery. He  chastised his executives for driving expensive cars  and resisted  using a corporate jet for many years. If the averag e American didn't  have those things, then neither should those who ar e supposed to  be their champions.   ======================================== [Página 233] ======================================== SPLIT HAPPENS  227 Wal-Mart never went through a split under Walton's command,  because Walton never forgot where he came from. "I still can't be- lieve it was news that I get my hair cut at the bar bershop. Where  else would I get it cut?" he said. "Why do I drive a pickup truck?  What am I supposed to haul my dogs around in, a Rol ls-Royce?"  Often seen wearing his signature tweed jacket and a  trucker's cap,  Walton was the embodiment of those he aimed to serv e—the  average-Joe American.   With a company so beloved by employees, customers a nd com- munities, Walton made only one major blunder. He di dn't put his  cause into clear enough words so that others could continue to lead  the cause after he died. It's not entirely his faul t. The part of the  brain that controls the WHY doesn't control languag e. So, like so  many, the best Walton could articulate was HOW to b ring his cause  to life. He talked about making products cheap to m ake things more  affordable to the average working American. He talk ed about  building stores in rural communities so that the ba ckbone of Amer- ica's workforce didn't have to travel to the urban centers. It all made  sense. All his decisions passed the Celery Test. It  was the WHY  upon which the company was built, however, that was  left unsaid.   Walton was involved in the company until just befor e his death,  when his ailing health prevented him from participa ting any longer.  Like all organizations with founder-leaders whose p hysical presence  helps keep the WHY alive, his continued involvement  i|j the  company had reminded everyone WHY they came to work  every  day. He inspired everyone around him. Just as Apple  ran  oij the  fumes of Steve Jobs for a few years after he left t he company before  significant cracks started to show, so did Wal-Mart  remember Sam  Walton and his WHY for a short time after he died. But  as the WHY  started to get fuzzier and fuzzier, the company cha nged direction.  From then on, there would be a new motivation at th <! company,  ======================================== [Página 234] ======================================== START WITH WHY  228 and it was something that Walton himself cautioned against:  chasing money.   Costco was cofounded in 1983 by WHY-type Jim Sinega l and  HOW -type Jeffrey Brotman. Sinegal learned about discou nt retailing  from Sol Price, the same person from whom Sam Walto n admitted  to "borrowing" much of what he knew about the busin ess. And, like  Walton, Sinegal believes in people first. "We're go ing to be a  company that's on a first-name basis with everyone, " he said in an  interview on ABC's newsmagazine show  20/20.  Following the same  formula as other inspiring leaders, Costco believes  in looking after  its employees first. Historically, they have paid t heir people about  40 percent more than those who work at Sam's Club, the Wal-Mart- owned discount warehouse. And Costco offers above-a verage  benefits, including health coverage for more than 9 0 percent of their  employees. As a result, their turnover is consisten tly five times  lower than Sam's Club.   Like all companies built around a cause, Costco has  relied on  their megaphone to help them grow. They don't have a PR depart- ment and they don't spend money on advertising. The  Law of Dif- fusion is all that Costco needed to get the word ou t. "Imagine that  you have 120,000 loyal ambassadors out there who ar e constantly  saying good things about you," quips Sinegal, recog nizing the value  of trust and loyalty of his employees over advertis ing and PR.   For years, Wall Street analysts criticized Costco's  strategy of  spending so much on their people instead of on cutt ing costs to  boost margins and help share value. Wall Street wou ld preferred the  company to focus on WHAT they did at the expense of  WHY they  did it. A Deutsche Bank analyst told  FORTUNE  magazine, "Costco  continues to be a company that is better at serving  the club member  and employee than the shareholder."   Fortunately, Sinegal trusts his gut more than he tr usts Wall Street  analysts. "Wall Street is in the business of making  money between  ======================================== [Página 235] ======================================== SPLIT HAPPENS  229 now and next Tuesday," he said in the  20/20  interview. "We're in the  business of building an organization, an institutio n that we hope  will be here fifty years from now. And paying good wages and  keeping people working with you is very good busine ss."   The amazing insight in all of this is not just how inspiring Sinegal  is, but that almost everything he says and does ech oes Sam Walton.  Wal-Mart got as big as it did doing the exact same thing— focusing  on WHY and ensuring that WHAT they did proved it. M oney is  never a cause, it is always a result. But on that f ateful day in April  1992, Wal-Mart stopped believing in their WHY.   Since Sam Walton's death, Wal-Mart has been battere d by scan- dals of mistreating employees and customers all in the name of  shareholder value. Their WHY has gone so fuzzy that  even when  they do things well, few are willing to give them c redit. The com- pany, for example, was among the first major corpor ations to de- velop an environmental policy aimed at reducing was te and  encouraging recycling. But Wal-Mart's critics have grown so skepti- cal of the company's motives that the move was larg ely dismissed as  posturing. "Wal-Mart has been working to improve it s image and  lighten its environmental impact for several years now," a column  published on the  New York Times  Web site on October 28, 2008, read.  "Wal-Mart is still selling consumerism even as it p ledges to cut the  social and environmental costs of making the stuff in its stores."  Costco, on the other hand, was later than Wal-Mart to announce an  environmental policy, yet has received a disproport ionate amount  of attention. The difference is that people  believe  it when Costco does  it. When people know WHY you do WHAT you do, they a re willing  to give you credit for everything that could serve as proof of WHY.  When they are unclear about your WHY, WHAT you do h as no  context. Even though the things you do or decisions  you make may  be good, they won't make sense to others without a clear un- derstanding of WHY.   ======================================== [Página 236] ======================================== START WITH WHY  230 And what of the results? Still running on the memor y of Sam  Walton, Wal-Mart's culture stayed intact at first, and the value of the  two stocks was about even for a few years after Wal ton died. But as  Wal-Mart continued to run its business in a post-Sa m, post-split  manner while Costco maintained clarity of WHY, the difference in  value changed dramatically. An investment in Wal-Ma rt on the day  Sam Walton died would have earned a shareholder a 3 00 percent  gain by the time this book was written. An investme nt made in  Costco on the same day would have netted an 800 per cent gain.   Costco's advantage is that the embodiment of their WHY, Jim  Sinegal, is still there. The things he says and doe s help reinforce to  all those around him what the company stands for. S taying true to  that WHY, Sinegal draws a $430,000 salary, a relati vely small  amount given the size and success of the company. A t Wal-Mart's  peak, Sam Walton never took a salary of more than $ 350,000 per  year, also consistent with what he believed. David Glass, the first  man to take over as CEO after Sam Walton, a man who  had spent  considerable time around Walton, said, "A lot of wh at goes on these  days with high-flying companies and these overpaid CEOs, who're  really just looting from the top and aren't watchin g out for anybody  but themselves, really upsets me. It's one of the m ain things wrong  with American business today."   Three more CEOs have attempted to carry the torch t hat Walton  lit. And with each succession that torch, that clea r sense of purpose,  cause and belief, has grown dimmer and dimmer. The new hope lies  in Michael T. Duke, who took over as CEO in early 2 009. Duke's  goal is to restore the luster and the clarity of Wa l-Mart's WHY.   And to do it, he started by paying himself an annua l salary of  $5.43 million.    ======================================== [Página 237] ========================================   231 PART 6  DISCOVER WHY    ======================================== [Página 238] ========================================   232  ======================================== [Página 239] ========================================   233 13    THE ORIGINS OF A WHY   It started in Vietnam War-era Northern California, where  antigovernment ideals and distain for large centers  of power ran  rampant. Two young men saw the power of government and  corporations as the enemy, not because they were bi g, per se, but  because they squashed the spirit of the individual.  They imagined a  world in which an individual had a voice. They imag ined a time  when an individual could successfully stand up to i ncumbent  power, old assumptions and status-quo thoughts and successfully  challenge them. Even redirect them. They hung out w ith hippie  types who shared their beliefs, but they saw a diff erent way to  change the world that didn't require protesting or engaging in  anything illegal.   Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs came of age in this ti me. Not only  was the revolutionary spirit running high in Northe rn California,  but it was also the time and place of the computer revolution. And  in this technology they saw the opportunity to star t their own rev- olution. "The Apple gave an individual the power to  do the same  things as any company," Wozniak recounts. "For the first time ever,  one person could take on a corporation simply becau se they had the  ability to use the technology." Wozniak engineered the Apple I and  ======================================== [Página 240] ======================================== START WITH WHY  234 later the Apple II to be simple enough for people t o harness the  power of the technology. Jobs knew how to sell it. Thus was born   Apple Computer. A company with a purpose—to give th e  individual to power to stand up to established powe r. To empower  the dreamers and the idealists to challenge the sta tus quo and  succeed. But their cause, their WHY, started long b efore Apple was  born.   In 1971, working out of Wozniak's dorm room at UC B erkeley  the two Steves made something they called the Blue Box. Their little  device hacked the phone system to give people the a bility to; avoid  paying long-distance rates on their phone bills. Ap ple computers  didn't exist yet, but Jobs and Woz were already cha llenging a Big  Brother-type power, in this case Ma Bell, American Telephony and  Telegraph, the monopoly phone company. Technically,  what the  Blue Box did was illegal, and with no desire to cha llenge power; by  breaking the law, Jobs and Woz never actually used the device  themselves. But they liked the idea of giving other  individuals the  ability to avoid having to play by the rules of mon opolistic forced a  theme that would repeat many more times in Apple's future. '   On April 1, 1976, they repeated their pattern again . They took on  the giants of the computer industry, most notably B ig Blue IBM.  Before the Apple, computing still meant using a pun ch card to give  instructions to a huge mainframe squirreled away in  a computer  center somewhere. IBM targeted their technology to corporations  and not, as Apple intended, as a tool for individua ls to target,  corporations. With clarity of purpose and amazing d iscipline,  Apple Computer's success seemed to follow the Law o f  Diffusion   almost by design. In its first year in business, th e company sold $1  million worth of computers to those who believed wh at they  believed. By year two, they had sold $10 million wo rth. By their  third year in business they were a $100 million com pany, and they  attained billion-dollar status within only six year s.   ======================================== [Página 241] ======================================== THE ORIGINS OF A WHY  235 Already a household name, in 1984 Apple launched th e Macintosh  with their famed "1984" commercial that aired durin g the Super  Bowl. Directed by Ridley Scott, famed director of c ult classics like   Blade Runner,  the commercial also changed the course of the  advertising industry. The first "Super Bowl commerc ial," it ushered  in the annual tradition of big-budget, cinematic Su per Bowl  advertising. With the Macintosh, Apple once again c hanged the  tradition of how things were done. They challenged the standard of  Microsoft's DOS, the standard operating system used  by most  personal computers at the time. The Macintosh was t he first mass- market computer to use a graphical user interface a nd a mouse,  allowing people to simply "point and click" rather than input code.  Ironically, it was Microsoft that took Apple's conc ept to the masses  with Windows, Gates's version of the graphical user  interface.  Apple's ability to ignite revolutions and Microsoft 's ability to take  ideas to the mass market perfectly illustrate the W HY of each  company and indeed their respective founders. Jobs has always  been about challenge and Gates has always been abou t getting to  the most people.   Apple would continue to challenge with other produc ts that  followed the same pattern. Recent examples include the iPod and,  more significantly, iTunes. With these technologies , Apple chal- lenged the status-quo business model of the music i ndustry—an  industry so distracted trying to protect its intell ectual property and  their outdated business model that it was busy suin g thirteen- year- old music pirates while Apple redefined the online music market.  The pattern repeated again when Apple introduced th e iPhone. The  status quo dictated that the cellular providers and  not the phone  manufacturer decide the features and capabilities o f the actual  phones. T-Mobile, Verizon Wireless, and Sprint, for  example, tell  Motorola, LG, and Nokia what to do. Apple changed a ll that when  they announced that, with the iPhone, they would be  telling the  ======================================== [Página 242] ======================================== START WITH WHY  236 provider what the phone would do. Ironically the co mpany that  Apple challenged with their Blue Box decades before , this time  around exhibited classic early-adopter behavior. AT &T was the  only one to agree to this new model, and so another  revolution was  ignited.   Apple's keen aptitude for innovation is born out of  its WHY and,  save for the years Jobs was missing, it has never c hanged since the  company was founded. Industries holding on to legac y business  models should be forewarned; you could be next. If Apple stays true  to their WHY, the television and movie industries w ill likely be next.   Apple's ability to do what they do has nothing to d o with indus- try expertise. All computer and technology companie s have open  access to talent and resources and are just as qual ified to produce all  the products Apple does. It has to do with a purpos e, cause or belief  that started many years ago with a couple of ideali sts in Cupertino,  California. "I want to put a ding in the universe,"  as Steve Jobs put it.  And that's exactly what Apple does in the industrie s in which it  competes. Apple is born out of its founders' WHY. T here is no  difference between one or the other. Apple is just one of the WHATs  to Jobs's and Woz's WHY. The personalities of Jobs and Apple are  exactly the same. In fact, the personalities of all  those who are  viscerally drawn to Apple are similar. There is no difference  between an Apple customer and an Apple employee. On e believes  in Apple's WHY and chooses to work for the company,  and the  other believes in Apple's WHY and chooses to buy it s products. It is  just a behavioral difference. Loyal shareholders ar e no different  either. WHAT they buy is different, but the reason they buy and  remain loyal is the same. The products of the compa ny become  symbols of their own identities. The die-hards outs ide the company  are said to be a part of the cult of Apple. The die -hards inside the  company are said to be a part of the "cult of Steve ." Their symbols  are different, but their devotion to the cause is t he same. That we  ======================================== [Página 243] ======================================== THE ORIGINS OF A WHY  237 use the word "cult" implies that we can recognize t hat there is a  ,  deep faith, something irrational, that all those wh o believe share*  And we'd be right. Jobs, his company, his loyal emp loyees and his  loyal customers all exist to push the boundaries. T hey all fancy a   good revolution.    Just because Apple's W HY is so clear does not mean everyone is,  drawn to it. Some people like them and some don't. Some people  embrace them and some are repelled by them. But it cannot be  denied: they stand for something. The Law of Diffus ion says that  only 2.5 percent of the population has an innovator  mentality— they  are a group of people willing to trust their intuit ion and take greater  risks than others. Perhaps it is no coincidence tha t Microsoft  Windows sits on 96 percent of the world's computers  whereas  Apple maintains about 2.5 percent. Most people don' t want to  challenge the status quo.   Though Apple employees will tell you the company's success lies  in its products, the fact is that a lot of companie s make quality  products. And though Apple's employees may still in sist that their  products are better, it depends on the standard by which you are  judging them. Apple's products are indeed best for those who relate  to Apple's WHY. It is Apple's belief that comes thr ough in all they  think, say and do that makes them who they are. The y are so  effective at it, they are able to clearly identify their own products  simply by preceding the product name with the lette r "i." But they  don't just own the letter, they own the  word  "I." They are a company  that champions the creative spirit of the individua l, and their prod- ucts, services and marketing simply prove it.       ======================================== [Página 244] ======================================== START WITH WHY  238 The WHY Comes from Looking Back   Conservative estimates put the numbers at three to one. But some  historians have said the English army was outnumber ed by six to  one. Regardless of which estimates you choose to be lieve, the pros- pects for Henry V, king of England, did not look go od. It was late  October in the year 1415 and the English army stood  ready to do  battle against a much bigger French force at Aginco urt in northern  France. But the numbers were just one of Henry's pr oblems.   The English army had marched over 250 miles, taking  them  nearly three weeks, and had lost nearly 40 percent of their original  numbers to sickness. The French, in stark contrast,  were better rested  and in much better spirits. The better-trained and more experienced  French were also excited at the prospect of exactin g their revenge on  the English to make up for the humiliation of previ ous defeats. And  to top it all off, the French were vastly better eq uipped; The English  were lightly armored, but whatever protection they did have was no  match for the superior weight of the French armor, But anyone who  knows their medieval European history already knows  the outcome  of the battle of Agincourt. Despite the overwhelmin g odds, the  English won.   The English had one vital piece of technology that was able to  confound the French and start a chain of events tha t would ulti- mately result in a French defeat. The English had t he longbow, a  weapon with astounding range for its time. Standing  far from the  battlefield, far enough away that heavy armor was n ot needed; the  English could look down into the valley and shower the French with  arrows. But technology and range aren't what give a n arrow its  power. By itself, an arrow is a flimsy stick of woo d with a sharpened  tip and some feathers. By itself, an arrow cannot s tand up to a sword  or penetrate armor. What gives an arrow the ability  to take on  experience, training, numbers and armor is momentum . That flimsy  stick of wood, when hurtling through the air, becom es a force only  ======================================== [Página 245] ======================================== THE ORIGINS OF A WHY  239 when it is moving fast in one direction. But what d oes the battle of  Agincourt have to do with finding your WHY?   Before it can gain any power or achieve any impact,  an arrow  must be pulled backward, 180 degrees away from the target. And  that's also where a WHY derives its power. The WHY does not come  from looking ahead at what you want to achieve and figuring out an  appropriate strategy to get there. It is not born o ut of any! market  research. It does not come from extensive interview s with customers  or even employees. It comes from looking in the com pletely  opposite direction from where you are now. Finding WHY is a  process of discovery, not invention.   Just as Apple's WHY developed during the rebellious  1960s and  '70s, the WHY for every other individual or organiz ation comes  from the past. It is born out of the upbringing and  life experience of  an individual or small group. Every single person h as a WHY and  every single organization has one too. An organizat ion, don't forget,  is one of the WHATs, one of the tangible things a f ounder or group  of founders has done in their lives to prove their WHY.   Every company, organization or group with the abili ty to inspire  starts with a person or small group of people who w ere inspired to  do something bigger than themselves. Gaining clarit y of WHY,  ironically, is not the hard part. It is the discipl ine to trust one's gut,  to stay true to one's purpose, cause or beliefs. Re maining completely  in balance and authentic is the most difficult part . The few that are  able to build a megaphone, and not just a company, around their  cause are the ones who earn the ability to inspire.  In doing so, they  harness a power to move people that few can even im agine.  Learning the WHY of a company or an organization or   understanding the WHY of any social movement always  starts with  one thing: you.     ======================================== [Página 246] ======================================== START WITH WHY  240 I Am a Failure   There are three months indelibly printed in my memo ry—  September to December 2005. This was when I hit roc k bottom.   I started my business in February 2002 and it was i ncredibly  exciting. I was "full of piss and vinegar," as my g randfather would  say. From an early age, my goal was to start my own  business. It  was the American Dream, and I was living it. My who le feeling of  self- worth came from the fact that I did it, I too k the plunge, and it  felt amazing. If anyone ever asked me what I did, I  would pose like  George Reeves from the old  Superman  TV series. I would put my  hands on my hips, stick out my chest, stand at an a ngle and with  my head raised high I'd declare, "I am an entrepren eur." What I did  was how I defined myself, and it felt good. I wasn' t like Superman, I  was Superman.   As anyone who starts a business knows, it is a fant astic race. There  is a statistic that hangs over your head—over 90 pe rcent of all new  businesses fail in the first three years. For anyon e with even a bit of  a competitive spirit in them, especially for someon e who defines  himself or herself as an entrepreneur (hands on hip s, chest out,  standing at a slight angle), these overwhelming odd s of failure are  not intimidating, they only add fuel to the fire. T he foolishness of  thinking that you're a part of the small minority o f those who  actually will make it past three years and defy the  odds is part of  what makes entrepreneurs who they are, driven by pa ssion and  completely irrational.   After year one, we celebrated. We hadn't gone out o f business.  We were beating the odds. We were living the dream.  Two years  passed. Then three years. I'm still not sure how we  did it—we never  properly implemented any good systems and processes . But to heck  with it, we'd beaten the odds. I had achieved my go al and that's all  that mattered. I was now a proud member of a very s mall group of  ======================================== [Página 247] ======================================== THE ORIGINS OF A WHY  241 people who could say, with statistical proof, that I was an American  small business owner.   The fourth year would prove to be very different. T he novelty of  being an entrepreneur had worn off. I no longer sto od like George  Reeves. When asked what I did, I would now tell peo ple that I did  "positioning and strategy consulting." It was much less exciting and  it certainly didn't feel like a big race anymore. I t was no longer a  passionate pursuit, it was just a business. And the  reality was that  the business did not look that rosy.   We were never a runaway success. We made a living, but not  much more. We had some FORTUNE 500 clients and we d id good  work. I was crystal clear on what we did. And I cou ld tell you how  we were different—how we did it. Like everyone else  in the game, I  would try to convince prospective clients how we di d it, how we  were better, how our way was unique ... and it was hard work. The  truth is, we beat the odds because of my energy, no t because of my  business acumen, but I didn't have the energy to su stain that  strategy for the rest of my life. I was aware enoug h to know that we  needed better systems and processes if the business  was to sustain  itself.   I was incredibly demoralized. Intellectually, I cou ld tell you what  I needed to do, I just couldn't do it. By September  2005 I was the  closest I've ever been to, if I wasn't already, com pletely depressed.  My whole life I'd been a pretty happy-go-lucky guy,  so just being  unhappy was bad enough. But this was worse.   The depression made me paranoid. I was convinced I was going  to go out of business. I was convinced I was going to be evicted  from my apartment. I was certain anyone who worked for me didn't  like me and that my clients knew I was a fraud. I t hought everyone I  met was smarter than me. I thought everyone I met w as better than  me. Any energy I had left to sustain the business n ow went into  propping myself up and pretending that I was doing well.   ======================================== [Página 248] ======================================== START WITH WHY  242 If things were to change, I knew I needed to learn to implement  more structure before everything crashed. I attende d conferences,  read books and asked successful friends for advice on how to do it.  It was all good advice, but I couldn't hear it. No matter what I was  told, all I could hear was that I was doing everyth ing wrong. Trying  to fix the problem didn't make me feel better, it m ade me feel worse.  I felt more helpless. I started having desperate th oughts, thoughts  that for an entrepreneur are almost worse than suic ide: I thought  about getting a job. Anything. Anything that would stop the feeling  of falling I had almost every day.   I remember visiting the family of my future brother -in-law for  Thanksgiving that year. I sat on the couch in the l iving room of his  mother's house, people were talking to me, but I ne ver heard a  word. If I was asked questions, I replied only in p latitudes. I didn't  really desire or even have the ability to make conv ersation anymore.  It was then that I realized the truth. Statistics n otwithstanding, I was  a failure.   As an anthropology major in college and a strategy guy in the  marketing and advertising world, I had always been curious about  why people do the things they do. Earlier in my car eer I started  becoming curious about these same themes in the rea l world—in  my case, corporate marketing. There is an old sayin g in the industry  that 50 percent of all marketing works, the problem  is, which 50  percent? I was always astounded that so many compan ies would  operate with such a level of uncertainty. Why would  anyone want  to leave the success of something that costs so muc h, with so much  at stake to the flip of a coin? I was convinced tha t if some marketing  worked, it was possible to figure out why.   All companies of equal resources have equal access to the same  agencies, the same talent, and the same media, so w hy does some  marketing work and some doesn't? Working in an ad a gency I'd  seen it all the time. With conditions relatively eq ual, the same team  ======================================== [Página 249] ======================================== THE ORIGINS OF A WHY  243 could develop a campaign that would be hugely succe ssful one  year, then develop something the next year that wou ld do nothing.  Instead of focusing on the stuff that didn't work, I chose to focus on  the stuff that worked to find out what it all had i n common. The  good news for me was there was not much to study.   How has Apple been able to so consistently outmarke t their  competition over and over and over? What did Harley -Davidson do  so well that they were able to create a following o f people so loyal  that they would tattoo a corporate logo on their bo dies? Why did  people love Southwest Airlines so much—they aren't really  that  special... are they? In an attempt to codify why th ese worked, I  developed a simple concept I called The Golden Circ le. But my little  theory sat buried in my computer files. It was a li ttle pet project  With no real application, just something I found in teresting.   It would be months later that I met a woman at an e vent who  took an interest in my perspectives in marketing. V ictoria Duffy  Hopper grew up in an academic family and also has a  lifelong  fascination with human behavior. She was the first to tell me about  the limbic brain and the neocortex. My curiosity pi qued by what she  was telling me, I started reading about the biology  of the brain, and  it was then that I made the real discovery.   The biology of human behavior and The Golden Circle  overlapped  perfectly. While I was trying to understand why som e marketing  worked and some didn't, I had tripped over somethin g vastly more  profound. I discovered why people do what they do. It was then  that I realized what was the real cause of my stres s. The problem  wasn't that I didn't know what to do or how to do i t, the problem  was I had forgotten WHY. I had gone through what I now know is a  split, and I needed to rediscover my WHY.     ======================================== [Página 250] ======================================== START WITH WHY  244 To Inspire People to Do the Things That Inspire The m   Henry Ford said, "If you think you can or you think  you can't,  you're right." He was a brilliant WHY-guy who chang ed the way  industry works. A man who embodied all the characte ristics of a  great leader, who understood the importance of pers pective. I  wasn't any dumber than I was when I started my busi ness, probably  the opposite, in fact. What I had lost was perspect ive. I knew what I  was doing, but I had forgotten WHY. There is a diff erence between  running with all your heart with your eyes closed a nd running with  your all your heart with your eyes wide open. For t hree years, my  heart had pounded but my eyes had been closed. I ha d passion and  energy, but I lacked focus and direction. I needed to remember what  inspired my passion.   I became obsessed with the concept of WHY. I was co nsumed by  the idea of it. It was all I talked about. When I l ooked back to my  upbringing, I discovered a remarkable theme. Whethe r among  friends, at school or professionally, I was always the eternal opti- mist. I was the one who inspired everyone to believ e they could do  whatever they wanted. This pattern is my WHY. To in spire. It didn't  matter if I was doing it in marketing or consulting . It didn't matter  what types of companies I worked with or in which i ndustries I  worked. To inspire people to do the things that ins pired them, so  that, together, we can change the world. That's the  path to which  my life and my work is now completely devoted. Henr y Ford  would have been proud of me. After months of thinki ng I couldn't,  now I knew I could.   I made myself a guinea pig for the concept. If the reason I hit  rock bottom was because my Golden Circle was out of  balance, then  I needed to get it back in balance. If it was impor tant to start with  WHY, then I would start with WHY in everything I di d. There is not  a single concept in this book that I don't practice . I stand at the  mouth of my megaphone and I talk about the WHY to a nyone who  ======================================== [Página 251] ======================================== THE ORIGINS OF A WHY  245 will listen. Those early adopters who hear my cause  see me as a tool  in their arsenal to achieve their own WHY. And they  introduced me  to others whom they believed I could inspire. And s o the Law of  Diffusion started to do its job.   Though The Golden Circle and the concept of WHY was  working  for me, I wanted to show it to others. I had a deci sion to make: do I  try to patent it, protect it and use it to make lot s of money, or do I  give it away? This decision was to be my first Cele ry Test. My WHY  is to inspire people to do the things that inspire them, and if I am to  be authentic to that cause there was only one decis ion to make—to  give it away, to talk about it, to share it. There would never be any  secret sauce or special formula for which only I kn ew the  ingredients. The vision is to have every person and  every orga- nization know their WHY and use it to benefit all t hey do. So that's  what I'm doing, and I'm relying entirely on the con cept of WHY and  the naturally occurring pattern that is The Golden Circle to help me  get there.   The experiment started to work. Prior to starting w ith WHY, I  had been invited to give one public speech in my li fe. Now I get  between thirty and forty invitations per year, from  all sorts of audi- ences, all over the world, to speak about The Golde n Circle. I speak  to audiences of entrepreneurs, large corporations, nonprofits, in  politics and government. I've spoken at the Pentago n to the chief of  staff and the secretary of the Air Force. Prior to The Golden Circle, I  didn't even know anyone in the military. Prior to s tarting with  WHY, I had never been on television; in fewer than two years I  started getting regular invitations to appear on MS NBC. I've worked  with members of Congress, having never done any gov ernment or  political work prior to starting with WHY.   I am the same person. I know the same things I did before. The  only difference is, now I start with WHY. Like Gord on Bethune who  turned around Continental with the same people and the same  ======================================== [Página 252] ======================================== START WITH WHY  246 equipment, I was able to turn things around with th e things I al- ready knew and did.   I'm not better connected than everyone else. I don' t have a better  work ethic. I don't have an Ivy League education an d my grades in  college were average. The funniest part is, I still  don't know how to  build a business. The only thing that I do that mos t people don't is I  learned how to start with WHY.      ======================================== [Página 253] ========================================   247 14    THE NEW COMPETITION   If You Follow Your WHY, Then Others Will Follow You   "BANG!" The gun fires and the race is on. The runne rs take off  across the field. It rained the day before and the ground is still  damp. The temperature is cool. It is a perfect day for running. The,  line of runners quickly forms a pack. Like a school  of fish they come  together as one. They move as one. The pack sets a pace to  maximize their energy for the whole race. As with a ny race, in a    short period of time the stronger ones will start t o pull ahead and  the weaker ones will start to fall behind. But not Ben Comen. Ben  was left behind as soon as the starter gun sounded.  Ben's not the  fastest runner on the team. In fact, he's the slowe st. He has never  won a single race the entire time he's been on the Hanna High  School cross-country track team. Ben, you see, has cerebral palsy.   Cerebral palsy, a condition often caused by complic ations at.  birth, affects someone's movement and balance. The physical prob- lems endure for a lifetime. Misshapen spines create  a twisted pos- ture. Muscles are often withered and motor reflexes  slow. Tightness  in the muscles and joints also affect balance. Thos e with CP often  ======================================== [Página 254] ======================================== START WITH WHY  248 have an unsteady gait, their knees knock and their feet drag. To an  outsider, they may seem clumsy. Or even broken.   The pack pulls farther and farther ahead while Ben falls farther  and farther behind. He slips on the wet grass and f alls forward into  the soft earth. He slowly picks himself up and keep s going. Down  he goes again. This time it hurts. He gets back up and keeps run- ning. Ben won't quit. The pack is now out of sight and Ben is  running alone. It is quiet. He can hear his own lab ored breathing.  He feels lonely. He trips over his own feet again, and down he goes  yet another time. No matter his mental strength, th ere is no hiding  the pain and frustration on his face. He grimaces a s he uses all his  energy to pull himself back to his feet to continue  running. For Ben,  this is part of the routine. Everyone else finishes  the race in about  twenty-five minutes. It usually takes Ben more than  forty- five  minutes.   When Ben eventually crosses the finish line he is i n pain and he  is exhausted. It took every ounce of strength he ha d to make it. His  body is bruised and bloodied. He is covered in mud.  Ben inspires  us, indeed. But this is not a story of "when the go ing gets tough, the  tough get going." This is not a story of "when you fall down, pick  yourself up." Those are great lessons to learn, wit hout a doubt, but  we don't need Ben Comen to teach us those lessons. There are  dozens of others we can look to for that, like an O lympic athlete, for  example, who suffered an injury just months before the games only  to come back to win a medal. Ben's lesson is deeper .   Something amazing happens after about twenty-five m inutes.  When everybody else is done with their race, everyo ne comes back  to run with Ben. Ben is the only runner who, when h e falls, someone  else will help pick him up. Ben is the only runner who, when he  finishes, has a hundred people running behind him.   What Ben teaches us is special. When you compete ag ainst everyone  else, no one wants to help you. But when you compet e against  ======================================== [Página 255] ======================================== THE NEW COMPETITION  249 yourself, everyone wants to help you. Olympic athle tes don't help  each other. They're competitors. Ben starts every r ace with a very  clear sense of WHY he's running. He's not there to beat anyone but  himself. Ben never loses sight of that. His sense o f WHY he's  running gives him the strength to keep going. To ke ep pushing. To  keep getting up. To keep going. And to do it again and again and  again. And every day he runs, the only time Ben set s out to beat is  his own.   Now think about how we do business. We're always co mpeting  against someone else. We're always trying to be bet ter than someone  else. Better quality. More features. Better service . We're always  comparing ourselves to others. And no one wants to help us. What  if we showed up to work every day simply to be bett er than our- selves? What if the goal was to do better work this  week than we  did the week before? To make this month better than  last month?  For no other reason than because we want to leave t he organization  in a better state than we found it?   All organizations start with WHY, but only the grea t ones keep  their WHY clear year after year. Those who forget W HY they were  founded show up to the race every day to outdo some one else in- stead of to outdo themselves. The pursuit, for thos e who lose sight  of WHY they are running the race, is for the medal or to beat some- one else.   What if the next time when someone asks, "Who's you r com- petition?" we replied, "No idea." What if the next time someone  pushes, "Well, what makes you better than your comp etition?" we  replied, "We're not better than them in all cases."  And what if the  next time someone asks, "Well why should I do busin ess with you  then?" we answer with confidence, "Because the work  we're doing  now is better than the work we were doing six month s ago. And the  work we'll be doing six months from now will be bet ter than the  work we're doing today. Because we wake up every da y with a  ======================================== [Página 256] ======================================== START WITH WHY  250 sense of WHY we come to work. We come to work to in spire people  to do the things that inspire them. Are we better t han our  competition? If you believe what we believe and you  believe that  the things we do can help you, then we're better. I f you don't believe  what we believe and you don't believe the things we  can do will  help you, then we're not better. Our goal is to fin d customers who  believe what we believe and work together so that w e can all  succeed. We're looking for people to stand shoulder -to-shoulder  with us in pursuit of the same goal. We're not inte rested in sitting  across a table from each other in pursuit of a swee ter deal. And here  are the things we're doing to advance our cause ... " And then the  details of HOW and WHAT you do follow. But this tim e, it started  with WHY.   Imagine if every organization started with WHY. Dec isions  would be simpler. Loyalties would be greater. Trust  would be a  common currency. If our leaders were diligent about  starting with  WHY, optimism would reign and innovation would thri ve. As this  book illustrates, there is precedence for this stan dard. No matter the  size of the organization, no matter the industry, n o matter the  product or the service, if we all take some respons ibility to start with  WHY and inspire others to do the same, then, togeth er, we can  change the world.   And that's pretty inspiring.   .   .      If this book inspired you, please pass it on to som eone you want to  inspire.  ======================================== [Página 257] ========================================   251   ACKNOWLEDGMENTS   There is nothing that brings me more joy and happin ess in this  world than waking up every day with a clear sense o f WHY—to  inspire people to do the things that inspire them. It is a simple thing  to do when surrounded by so many amazing people to inspire me.   There are countless people who believed in me and h elped me  over the years. I'd like to thank those who helped me build a piece  of my megaphone with this book. Amy Hertz was the f irst to insist  that I write it and introduced me to my incredible agent, Richard  Pine. Richard believes in doing good things in the world and has  made it his business to make authors out of those w ho have a pos- itive message to share. His patience and counsel ha ve been invalu- able. To Russ Edelman who was such a nice guy to in troduce me to  his editor, Jeffrey Krames, who, in turn, took a be t on me and let me  push him to do things differently. To Adrian Zackhe im, who  willingly challenges convention and is leading the evolution of the  publishing industry.   Thank you to Mark Rubin, who sees the colors I can see and in  whose basement I started writing, to Tom and Alicia  Rypma, in  whose home I continued writing, and to Delta Airlin es, for being so  good to me while I wrote so much at 35,000 feet. To  Julia Hurley,  who made sure everything was right. To the whole te am at Portfo- lio, who worked so hard to bring this book to life.  And, most im- ======================================== [Página 258] ======================================== Acknowledgments    252 portantly, to Laurie Flynn, who so passionately dev oted herself (and  her family) to help me tell this story.   I have had the great honor and privilege of meeting  some  wonderful people who have inspired me in a way that  is hard to  quantify. Ron Bruder has changed the way I see the world. Brig.  Gen. Lori Robinson has shown me what the humility o f great lead- ership looks like. Kim Harrison, who lives her WHY— to appreciate  all good things around her—and works tirelessly to see to it that  good ideas and people are appreciated. She taught m e what a true  partnership looks and feels like. And to those whos e shared what  they know to help bring the WHY to life, I am truly  grateful for  your time and energy: Colleen Barrett, Gordon Bethu ne, Ben  Comen, Randy Fowler, Christina Harbridge, Dwayne Ho nor6,  Howard Jeruchimowitz, Guy Kawasaki, Howard Putnam, James  Tobin, Acacia Salatti, Jeff Sumpter, Col. "Cruiser"  Wilsbach and  Steve Wozniak.   Long before there was even an idea of a book, there  were all the  people and early adopters who wanted to learn about  the WHY and  use The Golden Circle to help build their organizat ions. This  forward-thinking group were willing to embrace a ne w idea and  were essential to helping me figure out many of the  details and  nuances of the concept. Thank you to Geoffrey Dziko wski, Jenn  Podmore, Paul Guy, Kal Shah, Victor DeOliveria, Ben  Rosner,  Christopher Bates, Victor Chan, Ken Tabachnick, Ric hard Baltimore,  Rick Zimmerman, Russ Natoce, Missy Shorey, Morris S temp, Gabe  Solomon, Eddie Esses and Elizabeth Hare, who saw th e value of the  WHY in building the most valuable organization of a ll— her family.  Thank you to Fran Biderman-Gross, who is not only a n early  adopter, but who went out of her way to embrace her  WHY in all  aspects of her life and to encourage others to lear n their WHY, too.  Thank you to Congresswoman Stephanie Herseth Sandli n,  Congressman Paul Hodes, and Congresswoman Allyson S chwartz,  ======================================== [Página 259] ======================================== Acknowledgments  253 who gave me so much and continue to give back to ot hers with such  passion.   Over the years there were those who gave me a break  and helped  advance my cause. Thank you to Trudi Baldwin, the d irector of the  Graduate Program in Strategic Communications at Col umbia  University (a wonderful program), Jim Berrien, who trusted me, the  indefatigable Jack Daly, who teaches me, Piers Fawk es, Denis  Glennon, who pushed me, Kevin Goetz, Tony Gomes, Pa ul  Gumbinner, who gave me a career on a silver platter , Kenneth Hein,  Peter Intermaggio, who taught me self-reliance, Pam ela Moffat, Rick  Sapio, who keeps doing good things for me, Alana Wi nter and Matt  Weiss, for asking me to share my thoughts with an a udience, and  Diederik Werdmolder who took a bet on me right at t he start.   I am grateful to all the brilliant minds I have met  within the U.S.  Air Force who stuck their necks out to try somethin g different. They  embody the WHY of the USAF: to find and deliver bet ter ways of  doing things. To Maj. Gen. Erwin Lessel (who first introduced me to  the organization), Maj. Gen. William Chambers, Brig . Gen. Walter  Givhan, Brig. Gen. Dash Jamieson (who never stops b elieving), Maj.  Gen. Darren McDew, Brig. Gen. (Sel) Martin Neubauer  (who knows  more than I will ever know), Christy Nolta, Brig. G en. Janet  Therianos and Lt. Col. Dede Halfhill (you owe me on e, DeDe).   I am immensely grateful to all the brilliant people  and candid  conversations that inspired so many of the ideas th at became The  Golden Circle and all its parts. Thank you to Kendr a Coppey, who  helped me out of the hole in late 2005 and to Mark Levy, who  pointed me in the right direction. Thanks to Peter Whybrow, who  saw a problem in America and helped me to understan d the  neuroscience of it all. Kirt Gunn, whose brilliant storytelling mind  inspired the split. Every conversation with Brian C ollins  illuminated something new. Thank you to Jorelle Laa kso, who  taught me to reach for the things I believe in. To William Ury, who  ======================================== [Página 260] ======================================== Acknowledgments    254 showed me a path to follow, and Lt. Gen. David Dept ula, who is  probably the smartest person I know and gave me a n ew  perspective for solving highly complex problems.   My understanding of the WHY would be incomplete wit hout  the conversations, help and support of Nic Askew, R ichard  Baltimore, Christopher Bennett, Christine Betts, Ar iane de  Bonvoisin, Scott Bornstein, Tony Conza, Vimal Dugga l, Douglas  Fiersetin, Nathan Frankel, JiNan Glasgow, Cameron H erold, John  Hittler, Maurice Kaspy, Peter Laughter, Kevin Langl ey, Niki  Lemon, Seth Lloyd, Bruce Lowe, Cory Luker, Karl and  Agi Mallory,  Peter Martins, Brad Melt- zer, Nell Merlino, Ally M iller, Jeff  Morgan, Alan Remer, Pamela and Nick Roditi, Ellen R ohr, Lance  Piatt, Jeff Rothstein, Brian Scudamore, Andy Siegel , John Stepleton,  Rudy Vidal, the 2007 and 2008 classes of the Gather ing of Titans,  and the one and only Ball of Mystery.   To my late grandfather, Imre Klaber, who showed me that it is  more fun to be slightly eccentric than to be comple tely normal. To  my parents, Steve and Susan Sinek, who always encou raged me to  follow the beat of my own drum. And to Sara, my rem arkable,  remarkable sister, who appreciates that I keep my h ead in the  clouds but makes sure I keep my feet on the ground.   There are a few books and authors that have, over t he years,  inspired me, spurred ideas and offered me new persp ectives: the  works of Ken Blanchard, of Tom Friedman and of Seth  Godin, The  Starfish and the Spider  by Ori Brafman and Rod Beckstrom, First,  Break All the Rules  by Marcus Buckingham,  Good to Great  by Jim  Collins,  The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People  by Stephen Covey,  The  4-Hour Workweek  by Tim Ferriss,  Never Eat Alone  by Keith Ferrazzi,   E-Myth  by Michael Gerber,  The Tipping Point  and Outliers  by  Malcolm Gladwell,  Chaos  by James Gleick,  Emotional Intelligence  by  Daniel Goleman,  Made to Stick  by Chip and Dan Heath,  Who Moved  My Cheese?  by Spencer Johnson, M.D.,  The Monk and the Riddle  by  ======================================== [Página 261] ======================================== Acknowledgments  255 Randy Komisar,  The Five Dysfunctions of a Team  by Patrick Lencioni,   Freakanomics  by Steven D.

I want to especially thank all those people who hav e joined this  cause and actively work to inspire those around you . I am grateful  for all the e-mails and notes you send me, I save t hem all as a re- minder that it takes lots and lots of people, stand ing shoulder to  shoulder, to have a real impact.   And finally, to all those who read this book and pa ss it on to  someone you believe it will inspire, thank you.
