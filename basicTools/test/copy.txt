Praise for
Joseph Sugarman’s Previous Books
You have a real talent for promotion and writing 
advertisements.
Albert Gore, Former Vice PresidentUnited States of America
There are a lot of great copywriters, but Joe
Sugarman is the best. He knows how to build a story and close the sale. Anyone who wants to sell better will enjoy Advertising Secrets 
of the Written Word.
Richard Thalheimer, FounderThe Sharper Image
I have been a fan of Joseph Sugarman’s 
copywriting and marketing ideas for years and have beneﬁted greatly by imitating hislong-copy ads. Now he is letting us all in on his secrets in a book that should cost $2,000because it contains so much detailed information. Thank you, Joe. I really likedthe book!
Jack Canﬁeld, Co-AuthorChicken Soup for the Soul
======================================== [Página 4] ========================================

Every trade has its role models. And for me,
there is no better model for ad copywriters or magazine editors than Joe Sugarman.
Ray Schultz, EditorDIRECT Magazine
Joseph Sugarman is brimming over with cre-
ative ideas. That isn’t so unusual; many of usare. But Joe’s ideas rocket into our marketingconsciousness like shooting stars with one tri-umphant difference: His ideas invariably work.They motivate. They sell. So this isn’t a bookfor theoreticians. It’s aimed like an exquisitelypolished arrow into the heart of writing to sell.New to marketing? Read this book. Been in thebusiness for 30 years? Read this book.

From Seminar Participants Who Learned 
What You Are About to Learn
I enjoyed the seminar, and I learned a lot. I am
more determined than ever to start and succeedat running a mail order business.
Lee R. Herrington III, President
Herrington’s Catalog
Your seminar has really opened my eyes to 
a realization of what makes effective mail order advertising. I am sure that attending the seminar will pay dividends many timesover in the years ahead.
J. M. Robinson
Atlantic Richﬁeld Company
I told you I’d summarize the 6 or 8 major
things, new to me, that I got from the seminar.Going over the notes I ﬁnd it’s 36 major thingsI’ll be doing differently.
Gordon T. Beaham III, President
Faultless Starch/Bon Ami Company
======================================== [Página 6] ========================================

Not only did you teach me some fundamental
new concepts in space advertising, but youplanted some seeds that may well change ourmarketing program and perhaps even our wayof doing business.
Frederick J. Simon, President
Omaha Steaks International
I would recommend your seminars to novices 
to gain the degree of conﬁdence necessary towrite super ads almost instantaneously. Old-timers will also beneﬁt because what they’lllearn is that you can help them make their ordinary ads super successful. Although I’vebeen in mail order for more than 15 years I soonfound, as a result of your 5-day seminar, thatthere was more I didn’t know than I did know.
Ed Axel
Energy Group of America, Inc.
You did two things right. First, you charged
$2,000. This clever device guaranteed the quality of the participants and assured you oftheir rapt and undivided attention. Second, yougave them their money’s worth. I did only onething right. I came.
Joe Karbo
Huntington Beach, California
======================================== [Página 7] ========================================

The depth of knowledge and the skill with
which you organized and presented it was farabove what I anticipated when I signed up forthe seminar. But the real payoff was what thecourse covered that was not in the outline. I feel that the content relating to the philosophyof achieving success in life and the numerousexamples you provided to prove this philosophywill have the greatest payoff for us in the long run.
Ed Scoﬁeld
Garden Way Associates
When you’re a farmer you always worry about
the crop. It’s growing too slow—you worry. It’sgrowing too fast—you really worry. I ﬁnd it to be about the same when a farmer gets intospace advertising. The orders are coming in so good from our space ads, I’m beginning toworry. A high-class worry, I’ll admit.
Frank Schultz
Alamo, Texas
I most enjoyed your openness in revealing,
in depth, how you run your company. Few businessmen have the conﬁdence to give awaytheir “secrets” as you did!
C. L. Schaldenbrand
Word Processing Exchange
======================================== [Página 8] ========================================

At times the seminar combined high drama,
“made for TV” movie serialization, and mailorder technique in an unbeatable blend ofeducation and excitement. It was the best classI have taken since Harvard Business School.
John E. Groman
Epsilon Data Management
On my way back, on Friday night I stayed at
the Sheraton Centre Hotel in New York. My twobags with my clothes were stolen in the lobby ofthe hotel. I don’t care about the clothes, but Ican’t tell you how much I regret the loss of theseminar material, which is of inestimable valuefor me, and which was also in the bags.
Herman Van Hove
Brussels, Belgium
It has given me a fresh perspective and the
insight I had sought when I ﬁrst decided toattend your seminar. I now have a much clearerpicture of why our successful promotionssucceeded and our failures failed.

======================================== [Página 17] ========================================

By Ray Schultz, Editor, DIRECT Magazine
Every trade has its role models. And for me, there is no bet-
ter model for ad copywriters or magazine editors than JoeSugarman.
Bandleader Artie Shaw had a standard question for musi-
cians who wanted to join his band: “Who do you listen to?”
A similar question might be asked of writers applying for
work: “Who do you read?”
Sugarman is the guy who sells BluBlocker sunglasses on
TV . He also happens to be one of the most amusing and proliﬁcwriters in the United States, as I discovered when I started read-ing his JS&A catalog in 1985.
He was totally out of the box. He cracked me up with the
sheer exuberance of his copy approach.
He offered readers $10 for every spelling error they found
in his copy. (“Please don’t correct my grammar.”)
He offered “loaner” watches to customers as part of a ser-
vice guarantee.
He offered a $6 million home for sale in the airline maga-
zines, accepting American Express, Visa, MasterCard or anynegotiable hard currency. 
He sold a $240,000 airplane in a single mail order ad.And he did it all with a very special tone. It’s like Nelson
Algren said about John Cheever—that he was the one writer youcould identify “without turning the pages of The New Yorker
back to see who wrote it.”
Not that Sugarman is the most colorful rogue ever to write
great mail order copy. There were others. Louis Victor Eytinge, aconvicted murderer who learned how to write in prison. Or Gene
xvThe Sugarman Legacy Foreword
======================================== [Página 18] ========================================

Schwartz, the art collector, who made his living writing stuff like
“She Fled the Table When the Doctor Said Cut Her Open.”
But Joe surpassed those guys in a few very important
ways—the sheer volume of his writing, the trends that he set andmy favorite, the personal catalog, one in which the copy and theproduct reﬂect the quirks of the owner. And Joe has a lot of imi-tators who have personalized their catalogs using Joe’s catalogas their inspiration. 
How did Joe learn his trade? He claims he learned it from
his failures and not from the mail order greats who precededhim. Greats like David Margoles, who sold 4 million garliccrushers in the 1950s.
Then there was Max Sackheim, co-founder of the Book-of-
the-Month Club and another great pitchman who lived by hiswits. As Lester Wunderman in 1996 reﬂected about Sackheim,“When he talked to clients, he promised a breakthrough—not aswe have now, minuscule improvement.”
Then there was John Caples, who entered American folk-
lore by writing “They Laughed When I Sat Down at the Piano.”The late Larry Chait asked Caples why he stressed the socialbeneﬁts instead of just selling the virtues of the course.
“You don’t understand,” Caples answered. “Learning the
piano is tough. You can’t sell that. But you can sell the idea ofsocial success and overcoming whatever deﬁciencies you havein order to become popular.”
Though he may never have met them, Sugarman knows on
a gut level what these guys knew. And that’s important, becausehe’s one of the last of a breed.
Now for the good news. He’s passed the tradition down in
this handbook, the best book ever done on the subject of mail or-der writing.
Besides the advice on selling, it stresses basic truths about
writing, in language anyone can understand. I’ve even given themanuscript to my new reporters to read.
I’m sad to report that Sugarman doesn’t write as much copy
as he used to—no more catalogs and very few space ads. He’sfollowed the money into infomercials and home shopping.
xviFOREWORD: THE SUGARMAN LEGACY
======================================== [Página 19] ========================================

Until they reissue old JS&A catalogs (the way they’ve re-
issued the 1909 edition of Sears, Roebuck), this book will haveto stand as Joe’s legacy in print. But it’s a ﬁne legacy.
So here it is. Enjoy. As Walter Winchell said when he intro-
duced Damon Runyon, “The next act is better.”
Ray Schultz is one of the top writers and editors in the direct
marketing industry and editor of DIRECT magazine, a Cowles
Business Media publication.

======================================== [Página 20] ========================================


======================================== [Página 21] ========================================

Many people have contributed to my copywriting skills and to
the creation of this book, and to all of them I am very grateful.Mary Stanke, president of JS&A Group, Inc., whose direction,commitment and 35 years of service allowed me the creative free-dom to express myself through my writing and who helped mebuild a substantial business in the process. My ex-wife, Wendy,and our two children, April and Jill, for their understanding andsupport during the many seminars we held—always behind thescenes, but their presence was very important and always felt.Judy Sugarman, my sister and copyeditor for 25 years—alwaysthere to correct my spelling, undangle my modiﬁers and give mevery candid feedback.
I also wish to acknowledge the thousands of customers who
gave me a tremendous education and for whom I have an un-wavering respect. I wish to acknowledge my many competitors,too. I hated it when they copied me, but in the process of trying tooutwit them my copywriting skills grew even stronger. There arehundreds of other people I could mention—too numerous to listhere—who have played a vital role in my success and growth. 
A special acknowledgment to all my wonderful seminar
participants who learned from me and went on to create or buildsuccessful businesses—all through the power of their pens. Ilearned a great deal from them. Finally, I wish to thank, with hu-mility and gratitude, all who have exchanged their hard-earnedmoney for this book. May you, too, learn and prosper.

The truly creative mind in any ﬁeld is no more than . . . 
a cruelly delicate organism with the overpoweringnecessity to create, create, create—so that without thecreating of music or poetry or books or buildings orsomething of meaning, his very breath is cut off from him. He must create, must pour out creation. By somestrange, unknown, inward urgency he is not really aliveunless he is creating.
—Pearl Buck
This is a story about a seminar. It was a copywriting and mar-
keting seminar I presented starting in the 1970s during a timewhen I was actively involved in both writing copy and market-ing a range of products that included everything from electronicsto collectibles—from Bone Fones to Picasso tiles.
I was a proliﬁc writer, often writing complete catalogs,
print advertisements and direct mailings. And I owned the com-pany, JS&A Group, Inc., that sold these products, so I experi-enced the direct consequences of my successes and failures.
Failures Outnumbered Successes
My failures far outnumbered my successes. In fact, I have yet to
ﬁnd anybody who has experienced the number of failures I expe-rienced during the early stages of my career. But it was throughthese failures that I received a very costly education that to thisday has guided me through a successful career in advertising anddirect marketing.
To the public, I was a big success. Babe Ruth is remem-
bered for his home run record and not for the fact that he alsoheld the record for the most strikeouts. And so it was with me.
1The Origins of This Book Introduction
======================================== [Página 26] ========================================

Most people just saw my successes, as they were quite visible.
And they just saw my successful innovations because they werethe ones that worked. So to the general public and to others in di-rect marketing, it appeared that I had the Midas touch.
I didn’t see myself running seminars. I was busy enough
running my business. And to share my secrets with the industrywas only asking for competition. But it was a series of coinci-dences that prompted me to offer seminar courses and I’m glad Imade the decision to do them. And many of my participants areglad, too—people whose seminar experience made an enormousdifference in their lives.
My seminar was different. First, I was an actual practi-
tioner—not an educator or a consultant who never had to make amajor marketing gamble or cover a payroll. I was out there onthe ﬁring line, making sure each day that the copy I was writingand the marketing decisions I was making were going to be ac-cepted by the marketplace.
Second, it was during a time when my success was reaching
a peak. Our mail order ads were appearing everywhere. They ap-peared in newspapers and magazines and on airplanes and withsuch regularity and frequency that the format was attracting agreat deal of attention and creating an entire ﬂock of imitators.
Finally, I realized what people were willing to pay just to
hear me as a speaker or talk to me as a consultant. Bernie Pargh,an entrepreneur and owner of B.A. Pargh, a business equipmentsales company, ﬂew from Nashville to Los Angeles one day justto hear me speak to a direct marketing group. “Joe, I’ve spentover $1,000 just to hear you speak for 45 minutes,” he told me.
I would also get calls from people who had marketing prob-
lems and would want to ﬂy to visit me in the Chicago suburb ofNorthbrook, where our company was based, just to sit and talk tome for 15 minutes.
The Fateful Visit
But the seminar would never have taken place had it not been for
a small vacation I took up to northern Wisconsin to visit my sis-ter and her family.
It was during that trip that I discovered the beauty of the
2INTRODUCTION: THE ORIGINS OF THIS BOOK
======================================== [Página 27] ========================================

north woods and made the decision, with my family, to ﬁnd a
second home there. The home I eventually found was a 10,000-square-foot, two-story building on a 16-acre site overlookingone of the most beautiful lakes I had ever seen. The property wasﬁlled with virgin timber—tall, stately pines and oak trees thathad escaped the lumbermen who cleared most of the trees fromnorthern Wisconsin during the 1800s.
But the home was costly and at the time something I
couldn’t afford. The price in 1977 was $350,000 and I couldn’treally justify it until my lawyer and close personal friend,George Gerstman, suggested I could use the facility as a seminarsite. “Hold marketing seminars at the place, turn it into a busi-ness and you could write off the entire property and even make aproﬁt,” he suggested.
The idea really appealed to me. It was a very unique setting.
It was isolated and quiet, and the fresh northern Wisconsin air atMinocqua was stimulating and invigorating.
I spent a great deal of the summer going up there with my
family and furnishing the facility for a seminar. I cleared away anumber of the odd buildings that dated back to the 1800s butwere in such disrepair that I had no choice but to remove them.My wife at the time, Wendy, helped pick out the furniture anddishes. She also hired a cook, housekeepers and the support staffneeded to run the seminars while Mary Stanke, my operationschief at JS&A, assisted with registering the participants andpreparing all the materials for the seminar. And so within a fewmonths the facility was transformed into an enchanting seminarsite—a learning center that I called “Nature’s Response.”
The Most Expensive Seminar
Back in 1977, I was charging $2,000 for ﬁve days—a price that
made it, at the time, the most expensive seminar in the directmarketing business. For my seminars 10 years later, I charged$3,000. I announced the seminar in Advertising Age and Direct
Marketing magazines in the format of one of my typical ads.
And the response was immediate. If Bernie Pargh was willing tospend $1,000 to ﬂy to Los Angeles to hear me speak for 45 min-utes and several people were willing to ﬂy from different parts of
3INTRODUCTION: THE ORIGINS OF THIS BOOK
======================================== [Página 28] ========================================

the United States to talk to me for just 15 minutes, I had a value
that certainly was worth $2,000 for ﬁve full days.
Within a few weeks, I had a full class with participants from
all over the world. We had somebody from Germany, severalfrom California and quite a few from the East Coast. We had afarmer from Texas and a dentist from Carmel, California. RichardViguerie, the conservative Washington fund-raiser, enrolled andof course Bernie Pargh attended. I actually had more participantsthan I wanted so I created a reservation list for my next seminar.
To get to Minocqua, the seminar participants had to ﬂy to
Chicago, board a commuter plane there and ﬂy to the town ofRhinelander, Wisconsin, where they then took a bus for the40-minute ride to their motel. To get to the seminar site, theparticipants took a pontoon boat from the motel and landed atour boathouse where they walked up a path to the house.
And at the house, they would ﬁnd several rooms outﬁtted as
classrooms, a large dining room, a kitchen and a very largewooden balcony where they could look out at the lake, relax andenjoy the clean north-woods air.
It was an idyllic setting in a remote part of America—a
place where my students would learn a form of copywriting andmarketing that they could not learn anyplace else.
The Book Contains Many Lessons
This book shares many of the lessons and experiences that were
taught at these seminars. You’ll learn how to mentally prepareyourself to write copy, how to write effective copy, and how topresent your product, concept or service in a novel and exciting way. You’ll learn what really works and what doesn’t and how to avoid many of the pitfalls that marketers fall into—and much more.
I convey my unique approach to copy by demonstrating my
thought process on everything from how copy should ﬂow to theelements every ad should have—from the psychology of copyand its motivational triggers to the emotions generated by words.But the seminar was certainly more than learning about copy andmarketing.
The seminar turned into a motivational experience for
4INTRODUCTION: THE ORIGINS OF THIS BOOK
======================================== [Página 29] ========================================

many who went on to become quite successful. Others, who
were already successful, couldn’t wait to get back to work andimplement their new knowledge. And they too grew in theprocess.
You too will understand how to relate what you’ve learned
about copywriting to other forms of marketing and you’ll seehow many of the same principles apply.
The Goal of Copy
Throughout this book, I talk about the eventual goal of writing
effective copy, namely: “To cause a person to exchange his orher hard-earned money for a product or service.” It’s really assimple as that.
Direct marketing is truly the tool of this century. Using it, you
can move millions of people to reach into their pockets for millionsof dollars—all from the power of your pen or the message you con-vey in print, on TV , on radio or on a computer screen.
For most of what I teach in this book I use a print ad as a
reference point. Print ads are among the most difﬁcult of allforms of direct marketing. On a single page, in two dimensions,located in a medium with hundreds of competing messages andwithout sound or motion, you’ve got to entice a person to startreading your ad, convey the complete story of your product orservice and then convince the person to reach for the phone andorder. To understand this process and to effectively implement itrequires a lot of experience and skill. But once you have mas-tered the skills, you will have the ability to build a business fromjust the power of your pen and with very little capital.
When Mike Valentine attended my seminar, he was operating
his radar detector company out of his garage. Later, using many ofthe skills I taught him, he grew his company, Cincinnati Mi-crowave (developer of the Escort Radar Detector), to a $140 mil-lion public company. Jimmy Calano was a young 20-somethingentrepreneur who had been giving small management seminarswhen he attended my course. He eventually became a majorforce in the seminar business with CareerTrack—a multi-mil-lion-dollar company. Victoria’s Secret sent two of their top mar-keting people when the company consisted of just two stores and
5INTRODUCTION: THE ORIGINS OF THIS BOOK
======================================== [Página 30] ========================================

a catalog. They eventually were acquired by The Limited and
became a powerful retail chain throughout the country.
From a UPS driver who had a fascination with direct mar-
keting and came to the seminar with his last $2,000 to JoeKarbo, author of The Lazy Man’s Way to Riches , who already
was a very successful mail order entrepreneur—they all camewith great anticipation and they all left with valuable knowledgethat helped them continue to grow and prosper.
17 Seminars Given
I had 312 students attending 17 seminars—from the ﬁrst one
in the summer of 1977 to the last one given in Maui, Hawaii,in the spring of 2000. The rest of my writing and marketing in-sights come from several years of experience since then in thevisual medium of TV—infomercials, TV spots and homeshopping.
Regardless of your current educational level or knowledge
of marketing, this book will give you fresh insights into theworld of copywriting, marketing, human behavior, the Internet,public relations and other lessons taught at my seminar.
Even if you are not interested in writing copy, you’ll have 
a better appreciation and understanding of the copywritingprocess—so much so that you will be conﬁdent that you too canwrite good copy or, at a minimum, critique copy.
So pull up an easy chair, prop your feet up and sink into one
of the most comprehensive contemporary books on the subjectof copywriting, marketing and creative expression—a treasurechest of insights that will entertain as it teaches.

This handbook is based on a book I wrote in 1998 called Adver-
tising Secrets of the Written Word . The book consisted of the
lessons I had taught at exclusive seminars I conducted beginningin 1977.
My challenge was to take the ﬁrst book, revise it to make it
current and add many of the copywriting techniques to be con-sidered when you write for the Internet, direct mail, public rela-tions releases and other copywriting tasks. In the revision processI had to reread my book chapter by chapter and revise it wherenecessary. What I discovered in this process was that all the prin-ciples remained the same regardless of changes in the way wecommunicate that have occurred since I wrote it.
The modiﬁcations were primarily to update certain facts
and ﬁgures that had changed over time or to cite a few examplesthat were more contemporary. Regardless of the media, however,one fact emerged. You should always ﬁrst express whateverproduct or service you are selling in a print direct response ad. Itis in this format that you can develop the real essence of yourproduct or service.
That’s exactly what I do. If I have to sell something on the
Internet, in a catalog, or on TV , I ﬁrst produce a print ad. Andfrom the print ad, if I do my job correctly, I will ﬁnd the cluesand the concepts that best reﬂect the strong selling points that Ican use in any other media.
With a print ad, you won’t have the interactive nature of the
Internet or the motion of TV images. You’ll need to sell yourproduct or service on a ﬂat piece of paper with no sound, no mo-tion—just your words.
In the ﬁrst section of this handbook, I take you through the
step-by-step creative process of writing that print direct responsead. I think you will be surprised at how easy it will seem once

you read the simple steps involved and learn about the thinking
process you have to develop.
I take the mystery out of the process and at the same time
show you how you can create great copy even if you’ve neverwritten any direct response copy before.
In fact, the most often heard comment I’ve gotten from
those who read my book is simply “I now realize how easy it isto write great copy.”
I have built several businesses from the power of my pen.
Being able to write copy for your own business is a powerfultool that will serve you for the rest of your life. And to learn how,let me guide you through the steps you will follow as youquickly master this skill.

======================================== [Página 35] ========================================

The preparation to become a copywriter involves knowledge.
There are two types. The ﬁrst is a very broad or general knowl-edge and the second is a very speciﬁc or targeted knowledge. Letme explain.
The best copywriters in the world are those who are curious
about life, read a great deal, have many hobbies, like to travel,have a variety of interests, often master many skills, get boredand then look for other skills to master. They hunger for experi-ence and knowledge and ﬁnd other people interesting. They arevery good listeners.
Look at my background. I’m an instrument-rated multi-
engine commercial pilot, an amateur radio operator, and a pro-fessional photographer; I love computers, music, reading, movies,travel, art and design. I’ve done the complete catalog for mycompany including everything from setting the type to doingthe layout. I’ve done all the photography and even someof the modeling. (My hand became quite famous, butmore on that later.) I’ve tried many sports—golf,tennis, football, baseball, basketball, scuba diving,skiing, and snowmobiling. I’ve traveled to everycontinent on the globe with the exception of theAntarctic and I know I’ll eventually get there. I’vemastered a second language—German—during thethree years I spent with the military in Germany. I’ve had hun-dreds of failures and many successes, with each representing alearning experience.
The thirst for knowledge, a tremendous curiosity about life,
a wealth of experiences and not being afraid to work are the topcredentials for being a good copywriter.
If you examine the lives of some of our greatest writers,
you will see that they experienced a great deal and wrote abouttheir experiences. Hemingway, Steinbeck—both lived and then
11General Knowledge Chapter 1

interests and master

======================================== [Página 36] ========================================

wrote about their adventures. The more we experience and the
more knowledge we have, the easier it is to come up with thatbig copy idea or marketing concept.
But more signiﬁcantly, it is important to experience as
much in life as possible and not to fear failure. It’s not whetheryou win or lose in life that’s important but whether you play thegame. Lose enough and eventually you will win—it’s only amatter of time. Edwin Land, the inventor of the Polaroid cam-era, said it best when he described his deﬁnition of a mistake:“A mistake is a future beneﬁt, the full value of which is yet to berealized.”
I can remember when I was very young and would fail at
something I had tried very hard to accomplish. I’d often say to my-self, “No big loss—it’s in my back pocket. One of these days I’lluse what I’ve just experienced simply by reaching into my backpocket, and presto, I will have the answer just when I need it.”
Experiences Create Ideas
Our minds are like giant computers. Every experience that goes
into your brain—both good and bad—becomes more programmaterial and data to recall and assemble in new ways in the fu-ture. Remember when the ﬁrst Apple computers came out withtheir big 64K memories? You might also remember the slowspeed and the poor graphics compared to the high-powered per-sonal computers we have today. Today’s computers are faster,are more efﬁcient, can accomplish more and can interrelate in-formation faster and more easily. So it stands to reason, themore we’ve experienced, the more we can draw upon when itcomes time to relate those experiences to new problems or op-portunities.
There is nothing really new in life. It’s simply a matter of
taking previous pieces of knowledge and putting them togetherin a unique and different format. Matter is not created and de-stroyed. Everything on earth that was here a billion years ago ispretty much here now. The only difference is that it has takennew forms.
The more you have stored in your brain from experiences
and knowledge and the more you are able to interrelate that
12UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
======================================== [Página 37] ========================================

knowledge and come up with new combinations of old material,
the greater an idea person you will be and the more powerfulyour capabilities as a copywriter will be.
There is a saying that goes, “If all you have is a hammer,
you look at every problem as a nail.” The more tools you have towork on a problem in the form of experiences or knowledge, themore new ways you can ﬁgure out how to solve it.
Lateral Thinking for Ideas
Edward de Bono, one of the great creative thinkers of our time,
coined the term lateral thinking to describe the process of com-
ing up with ideas by not focusing or thinking of just the problem.Often, by relating the problem to something that has nothing todo with the problem, a new idea emerges.
De Bono created a product that he called his “Think Tank,”
which encouraged people to think more laterally and conse-quently more creatively. It was an eight-inch sphere mounted ona platform. Through a small window you could see a selection of14,000 words printed on small plastic pieces. You shook theThink Tank and then looked into it and wrote down the ﬁrst threewords you saw.
You then tried to relate the three words to your marketing
problem, to come up with a fresh perspective toward solving theproblem. For example, let us say I wanted to sell my airplane.Typically, I would run an ad and focus on just the airplane, itsfeatures and equipment. But in using the Think Tank for lateralthinking, I might draw three totally unrelated words, farm , sales-
man and compassion and have to create an ad incorporating
those three words. This process would cause me to search mybrain, my data bank, and all my past experiences for some wayto relate the three words while keeping in mind that I had to sellthe airplane.
The Dictionary as a Tool
Lateral thinking is simply a tool. So is your dictionary. And so is
your mind. Probably one of the most important keys in copywrit-ing and conceptualizing is the ability to relate totally divergentconcepts to create a new concept. Once again, the more data youhave to work with from your life experiences and the more your
13GENERAL KNOWLEDGE
======================================== [Página 38] ========================================

mind can relate this data to a problem, the better you are going to
be at coming up with that really great idea.
Running Your Own Company
Another factor that makes a great copywriter is the experience of
running your own company and being responsible for everyword you write. The really great direct marketing copywritersoften don’t work for advertising agencies, but rather run theirown companies and experience their own successes and failures.Ben Suarez, Gary Halbert, the late Gene Schwartz and dozens ofothers recognized as top copywriters have owned their owncompanies and learned over years of trial and error—years ofboth big mistakes and great success. You can’t beat that type ofexperience.
In my case, I have been presented with thousands of prod-
ucts, have written ads for hundreds of them and have had tocome up with that big idea hundreds of times a year. Even as Ilook back at my advertising, I see a learning curve that wouldnot have been possible had it not been for that immense wealthof broad experience. You’re going to read about many of thoseexperiences throughout this book. You’ll be able to avoid manyof the pitfalls and mistakes I made climbing my way up the lad-der and you’ll understand why these mistakes were indeed learn-ing experiences.
The preparation for becoming a great copywriter is a
lifestyle. It’s a hunger for knowledge, a curiosity and a desire toparticipate in life that is broad-based and passionate. If you havethis personality, you are already well on your way. If you don’t,simply being aware of it is often enough to start a mental processand movement that will take you to where you would like to be.But being a great copywriter is more than just having a lot of ex-perience in life. What you will learn in the next chapter is just asimportant.

Iwas sitting in the laboratory of the Sensor Watch Company in
Dallas, Texas, looking through a microscope and learning every-thing I could about how a new digital watch was designed, pro-duced and assembled.
I was becoming an expert on digital watch technology, on
integrated circuits, quartz crystals and oscillator circuits. “Whyare all the contacts gold-plated?” I asked the engineer. “They’regold-plated in every integrated circuit. It’s part of the technol-ogy,” was the reply.
The conversation continued. It had been two days and I was
still delving into every aspect of this new digital watch I wasplanning to introduce. I still hadn’t reached the point where Icould write an ad on the advantages of the new product. At thetime, most digital watches had liquid crystal displays, and in or-der to see the time, you had to press a button to illuminate thedisplay. On the new Sensor watch, the display glowed con-stantly, thanks to an inert but radioactive substance that wasplaced in a small ﬂat capsule behind the display.
New Technology Required Powerful Presentation
This new technology meant that you could glance down at your
watch and, in an instant, tell the time—even at night—withoutpressing any buttons. But I felt that there had to be a powerfulway of presenting the product and I still wasn’t comfortable withwhat I had.
The Sensor 770 was very expensive to make and sell. So I
knew that I needed something that made the watch I was sellingreally different and special.
“Why didn’t somebody think of this radioactive material
for watches before?” was my next question.
The engineer looked at me, paused for a second and then
said, “We haven’t had the technology to seal the radioactive ma-
15Speciﬁc Knowledge Chapter 2
======================================== [Página 40] ========================================

terial in a transparent capsule without it leaking out until some-
body developed a technique with a laser. The laser is what sealsthe capsule. Without the laser, there is no way you could com-pletely seal the capsule.”
That was all I needed. The concept was clear. And the ad
headline that I wrote for the new Sensor digital watch was,“Laser Beam Digital Watch.”
The story told of how the watch was made possible thanks
to a laser beam and how its new technology beneﬁted the con-sumer. That single concept resulted in millions of dollars in prof-itable sales for the digital watch.
When I had reached the point about the laser beam sealing the
capsule, I knew I had found that unique headline concept that madethe watch stand out from the competition. But it took a few days ofvery intensive learning and study before the concept emerged.Sometimes this can happen in a few minutes, sometimes it can hap-pen in a few hours and sometimes it may take weeks. This time ittook a few days of patience along with speciﬁc knowledge.
You Must Become an Expert
You need to become an expert on a product, service or any-
thing you write about to really be effective. Becoming an ex-pert means learning enough about a product to obtain enoughspeciﬁc knowledge so you can communicate the real nature ofwhat you are trying to sell. Say to yourself, “I am an expert orhave learned enough to be able to effectively communicate thisproduct to the consumer.” That’s what we mean by “speciﬁcknowledge.”
This doesn’t mean that you have to learn everything there
is to know about a subject every time. There have been timeswhen I simply looked at a product or service and came up withthe big idea from my own past experience or speciﬁc knowl-edge in a particular category. Remember, I’m a pilot, ham radiooperator and photographer. I already had not only vast knowl-edge of the gadgets I would sell in my business, but knowledgeof my customer, as well. I myself was my typical customer. Iwas the type of individual I had to sell products to because Iwas as gadget-oriented as the person I was trying to appeal to.
16UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
======================================== [Página 41] ========================================

You Must Know Your Customer, Too
And that’s another point. In addition to knowing your product or
service, you’ve really got to know your customer. You’ve got tobe an expert on who your customer is by gathering speciﬁc in-formation on whom you are selling to. You may already be anexpert by virtue of being a typical customer. You know yourlikes and dislikes, what excites you and what you yourself wouldexpect from a company selling you a product. But if it is your as-signment to write copy for a product or service that you reallydon’t have a feel for, then you have a great deal of studying to doto make sure you understand who your customer is and whatmotivates him or her.
You Must Understand a Product’s Nature
And even if you understand your customer and understand your
product, you must realize one more thing. There is a speciﬁcway that each product should be presented to your customer. Inshort, the product has a nature of its own and it’s up to you todiscover what the nature of that product is in the mind of theconsumer.
Let me cite a good example. Back when I ﬁrst started JS&A
in the basement of my home, I met Howard Franklin. Howardwas an insurance salesman from Chicago who bought his ﬁrstcalculator from me from an ad I ran in the Wall Street Journal .
He loved his calculator and stopped by one day to buy a fewmore of them. After that, Howard would stop by every once in awhile and buy more calculators as gifts for his better clients.
One day, Howard stopped by and said that since JS&A was
a growing concern, I should buy insurance. “You want to protectyour family because if anything ever happened to you, there maybe quite an estate and lots of taxes to pay before your familywould realize anything.”
“Thank you, Howard. I appreciate the offer, but I don’t 
really believe in insurance,” was my standard reply. 
But Howard was a good salesman. Every once in a while
Howard would clip out an article on calculators from a local pa-per or an article from some magazine on some new gadget andsend it to me with his card. And every once in a while, Howard
17SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE
======================================== [Página 42] ========================================

stopped by and picked up a calculator and again dropped the
comment, “Joe, you should really have insurance.”
“Thanks, Howard. I appreciate the advice,” was my typical
comment.
Then one day I heard a siren in front of my next-door neigh-
bor’s house. I looked out the window and within a few minutes,my neighbor was being carried out of his home on a stretcherwith a white sheet over him. He had died that morning from amassive heart attack. He was only in his 40s. I was 36 at the time.
The next day I called Howard on the phone. “Howard, re-
member our many discussions on insurance and protectingyour family and stuff? Well, I think that we should sit downand work out some sort of program for an insurance plan formy family and me.”
I had ﬁnally made the plunge. Was it Howard’s salesman-
ship? Was it his persistence? Maybe. But I realized from that
experience a really effective way to sell a wholeseries of products. Howard succeeded because hehad planted enough seeds in my mind for me to re-alize what insurance was for, who should sell it tome and who was a good friend and customer.When it came time to buy, only I, Joseph Sugar-man, would know. And only when there was an
immediate experience that hit close to home would I see the valueof insurance. I went through the experience and I responded.
Some of the implications from this example will be referred
to later in this book, but the point concerns the nature of a prod-uct. Every product has a nature to it that you must understand tobe successful when creating a marketing concept behind thatproduct. For example, from the insurance experience, I soon realized how to sell burglar alarms and became one of the largestburglar alarm sales companies in the country, protecting morehomes than any other company.
The alarm was called the Midex and my thoughts went
back to Howard as I created the ad. I knew that to scare peopleinto buying a burglar alarm was like Howard coming into mybasement and saying, “Joe, when you die, are you going toleave your wife and kids in ﬁnancial disaster?” That would
18UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
It took an event
close to home tomake me takeaction.
======================================== [Página 43] ========================================

never sell me insurance. Nor would a similar technique of quot-
ing crime statistics work to sell burglar alarms.
I realized that if I were to buy a burglar alarm, I would ﬁrst
have to recognize a need for one: perhaps if my neighbor wasrobbed or crime in my community was on the rise or I hadrecently purchased something expensive.
Once I had a need for a burglar alarm, I would look for one
that really made sense for my situation. The ﬁrst thing I wouldinsist on is that it worked. After all, the ﬁrst time I really needmy alarm to work may be the only time it would be called uponto work, and I’d want to make sure it worked ﬂawlessly.
The second thing that would be important to me is the ease of
installation. It would have to be so easy to install that it wouldn’trequire any outside person stringing wires all over my house. Sowhen I wrote the ad on the Midex burglar alarm, I made sure that Ispent several paragraphs on the reliability of the product and thetesting each unit went through before it was shipped. And I usedastronaut Wally Schirra as my spokesperson for the alarm. He wasquoted as saying, “I’m very pleased with my unit.”
Scare Tactics Don’t Usually Work
Never did I try to scare the prospective customer with crime sta-
tistics. It would look as ridiculous as Howard screaming orwarning me in my basement to get insurance because I may die.All I did was realize the nature of the product I was selling, bringout the points in the product that were important to the consumerand then wait until the consumer saw the ad enough times or wasthreatened close enough to home before he or she bought.
We received many orders from people who had cut out the
ad and put it in a ﬁle. When indeed they were threatened, theythen called and placed their orders. Fortunately, there wereenough people who wanted a unit when they saw the ad to earnus a nice proﬁt, but we also received orders months after westopped running our ads. And despite the fact that many of theelectronic products of the time were obsolete just a few monthsafter they were introduced, we managed to run our ad for overthree years before sales slowed down.
I have one other example on the importance of becoming an
19SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE
======================================== [Página 44] ========================================

expert on the product you sell by gaining speciﬁc knowledge in
order to write outstanding copy on a subject. It happened in1975, right at the start of the citizens band (CB) radio boom inthe United States. Back then, the U.S. government had imposeda reduced nationwide speed limit of 55 miles per hour to con-serve fuel. The lower speed limits really affected those 18-wheel long-haul truck drivers. Truck drivers responded bybuying CBs to communicate with each other.
The truck drivers would travel in caravans and truckers
ahead of the caravan would signal if there was a “Smokey” (po-lice ofﬁcer) in the area. Soon CBs became so popular that the av-erage motorist started buying them and a whole new fademerged in the United States—a fad so big that songs, moviesand a variety of products were created to capitalize on it. The CBunits themselves were in such demand that you couldn’t even getone without a wait, and thieves were stealing them out of carsand turning a very hefty proﬁt reselling them.
As a ham radio operator, I knew of the fun in radio commu-
nications and the advantages of having a unit in my car. This wasmy general knowledge. So I wanted to experience the fad and Idecided to get a CB radio. I then became somewhat of an experton it. There was a lot less to master with CB than there was withham radio, where I had to learn the Morse code at 13 words perminute and a great deal of technical information before passingmy operator’s test.
During the early stages of the fad, I was attending the Con-
sumer Electronics Show in Chicago when I bumped into MikeWeschler, a salesman, who showed me a new product. “Joe, hereis a miniature walkie-talkie.”
The Product Was Not Unusual
I looked at the small sliver of a product he handed me and real-
ized that a small walkie-talkie was no big deal. You could getthem at any RadioShack store. But Mike then pointed out thatthe unit had an integrated circuit—it was one of the few units us-ing this new type of technology and it indeed was smaller thanany of the other products on the market.
The product seemed a little more interesting after Mike 
20UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
======================================== [Página 45] ========================================

explained its features. It was so small that it could easily slip into
a shirt pocket. “What frequencies can you broadcast on and whatis the power?” I asked, calling on my knowledge of ham radio.
“The unit has two frequencies. One takes a crystal for any
of a number of frequencies and the other would be permanentlyset to a frequency around 27 megahertz.”
I looked up at Mike as he was demonstrating the unit and
asked him, “Mike, isn’t 27 megahertz near one of the CB fre-quencies?”
“Right. It’s channel 12 but don’t worry, there is not that
much radio trafﬁc on channel 12. It’s normally reserved forwalkie-talkies,” Mike assured me rather sheepishly as if I haddiscovered a fault with the unit.
“No, Mike, I think that will turn out to be an advantage.”
And indeed it was. I took the unit, called it a Pocket CB and soldover 250,000 of them at $39.95. It was a huge success and fullyattributable to my general knowledge combined with the speciﬁcknowledge of the unit and the discovery of that unique featurethat might have been overlooked by somebody else. 
Realize how important it is to know your product and
know your customer. It is this speciﬁc knowledge that willmake a dramatic difference in your ability to communicate yourthoughts in copy.
21SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE
======================================== [Página 46] ========================================


======================================== [Página 47] ========================================

One of the ﬁrst things I would ask my seminar students to think
about was the deﬁnition of good copywriting. Is it the skill of be-ing able to accurately put words on paper? Can it be taught?What sort of background do you need to be a good copywriter?
We would then talk about both general knowledge and spe-
ciﬁc knowledge. But I explained that there was more to the art ofcopywriting.
Copywriting is simply a written form of communicating
facts and emotions. It is a mental process. Some copywriters willtell you that many of their greatest works were well thought outin their minds even before they put them on paper.
Joe Karbo wrote one of the most successful income opportu-
nity ads ever written for his book, The Lazy Man’s Way to Riches,
in one draft and without corrections. It just poured out of his mindonto a sheet of paper. And it was one of the few ads he ever wrote.
Some copywriters will tell you that they just sit down and
start writing. Some ﬁnd that sitting in front of a computer doesthe trick and others need something like a pen and a pad of paper.
My greatest ads were written during a variety of circum-
stances. Many were well thought out before I put the ﬁrst wordto paper and they ﬂowed out with hardly a correction. Othertimes they would ﬂow but you wouldn’t recognize the ﬁrst draftfrom the last because of the number of corrections I made.Sometimes I would sit in an airplane and just write from takeoffto landing and come up with great copy. And other times, I usedmy computer with great success.
It’s All a Mental Process
The bottom line for all these approaches is that copywriting is
primarily the mental process of ﬁrst getting your thoughts orga-nized in your mind and then eventually transferring them ontopaper. There is no best method—just what works for you.
23Practice, Practice, Practice Chapter 3
======================================== [Página 48] ========================================

But the best place to start, without question, is to start.
That’s right. Pick up a piece of paper and a pen, and start. Doenough of it over a long enough period of time and I guaranteeyou, you’ll improve each year. Write articles for a local newspa-per. I started writing for my high school paper. It gave me expe-rience and conﬁdence. Write letters, write postcards—just plainwrite every opportunity you can.
I look over my very ﬁrst JS&A direct response ads and
can’t believe I wrote them. They were horrible. But I maturedand I learned with each ad I wrote. In my ﬁrst ads, I usedclichés—“It’s the product the world has been waiting for.” Andmy sentences weren’t ﬂowing as they do now. Sheer volume andexperience will do wonders. As they say to anybody wanting tomake it to Carnegie Hall,  “Practice, practice, practice.”
Don’t Worry about the First Draft
Another fact to realize about writing copy is that the ﬁrst draft of
an ad is often terrible and the real skill in copywriting is takingthat rough draft and polishing it. You might add words, deleteentire sentences, change the order of sentences or even para-graphs. It’s all part of the copywriting process. I often pointedout to my students that if everybody in the class were given theassignment of writing a draft of an ad for a product, the ﬁrst draftof my ad would quite likely be terrible compared to everybodyelse’s. It is what I do with the copy after my ﬁrst draft that reallymakes the difference.
In that ﬁrst draft the goal is to put something—anything—
on paper, the emotional outpouring of everything you are tryingto convey about your product or service. Don’t worry about howit reads. Just get it down onto something you can work with likea computer screen or a piece of paper and then go from there.
To deﬁne exactly what copywriting is, I often presented the
following axiom:
Copywriting is a mental process the successful execution of
which reﬂects the sum total of all your experiences, your spe-ciﬁc knowledge and your ability to mentally process that infor-mation and transfer it onto a sheet of paper for the purpose ofselling a product or service.

And in this book you will learn some of the valuable tech-
niques to use to expand your knowledge of the copywritingprocess so you can write copy that motivates people to take anaction—speciﬁcally to take their hard-earned money and ex-change it for your product or service.
Copywriting is the key to any successful direct marketing
venture. You can have the world’s best product or service, but ifyou can’t communicate your ideas, you have nothing. I will giveyou the skills and insights you need to successfully write copy.I’ve already personally taken the most expensive course ever. Ifyou would add up my failures and their cost to me, add the in-sights I received mostly from my failures, and then add the expe-riences I’ve had in copywriting and marketing, you would seethat it has indeed been an expensive education. And you’re aboutto share in it.

You are now ready to start to learn the techniques I use to write
copy. You already understand the importance of having a broadgeneral knowledge. This takes time and is a lifelong quest. Andyou understand the importance of obtaining speciﬁc knowledgeon a project you are working on. This I hope is quite clear fromChapter 2.
But what you are about to learn in this chapter and the chap-
ters that follow is the speciﬁc knowledge you will need to under-stand my copywriting approach and to become a top copywriter.
In these chapters, I present several axioms. Each one is in
bold type and each one is critical to your understanding of myphilosophy. The axiom presented in this chapter is very impor-tant and very difﬁcult to believe at ﬁrst. Understand this concept,believe in it and it will give you a good foundation for your fu-ture writing skills. Don’t believe in it and you’ll fall into the trapthat many copywriters typically fall into. 
To introduce the concept, let’s look at the CB radio ad on
the next page, which ran from 1975 through 1977. The ad has allthe elements you would expect any space ad to have. And to un-derstand this ﬁrst axiom, I would ask my students to deﬁne thepurpose of each of the 10 elements in an advertisement. The fol-lowing is what we ﬁnally decided:
1. Headline: To get your attention and draw you to the sub-
headline.
2. Subheadline: To give you more information and further ex-
plain the attention-getting headline.
3. Photo or Drawing: To get your attention and to illustrate the
product more fully.
4. Caption: To describe the photo or drawing. This is an im-
portant element and one that is often read.
27The Purpose of All the Graphic Elements of an Ad Chapter 4
======================================== [Página 52] ========================================

28UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS

======================================== [Página 53] ========================================

5. Copy: To convey the main selling message for your product
or service.
6. Paragraph Headings: To break up the copy into chunks,
thereby making the copy look less imposing.
7. Logo: To display the name of the company selling the prod-
uct.
8. Price: To let the reader know what the product or service
costs. The price could be in large type or could be buried in thecopy.
9. Response Device: To give the reader a way to respond to the
ad, by using the coupon, toll-free number or ordering infor-mation, usually near the end of the ad.
10. Overall Layout: To provide the overall appearance for the
ad, by using effective graphic design for the other elements.
After they clearly understood each of the elements that
comprise a direct response ad, I then told the class that there is asingular purpose for all the elements in an ad—a purpose so im-portant that it constitutes one of the essential concepts in my ap-proach to copy.
When you were ﬁrst attracted to the ad you might have
looked at the photo at the top of the page or the other photos.You might have then read the headline, read the subheadline andthen glanced down to the name of the company selling the prod-uct. You may have read the captions to both the pictures and thesketches and you may have noticed the toll-free number indicat-ing that you could order the product on the phone.
When you looked at the ad overall, you may have noticed
the layout, the paragraph headings scattered about the layout andthe attractive graphic and typographic presentation.
There are plenty of elements that can draw your attention
before you start reading the copy. But one of the most importantaxioms you will learn for becoming a great copywriter is my second axiom. Here it is:
All the elements in an advertisement are primarily designed to
do one thing and one thing only: get you to read the ﬁrst sen-tence of the copy.

======================================== [Página 54] ========================================

At this point, there was usually a confused look on the faces
of my students. They thought that each of these elements had its
own reason for existence. But I wassaying, “No, they are there strictly forthe sole purpose of getting you to readthe ﬁrst sentence.”
I know what you’re thinking.
“What about the headline? Isn’t it sup-posed to have a beneﬁt, be 16 wordslong and what abou t . . .” Stop. Just
accept my word at this point that each element has a single pur-pose and that is to get you to read the ﬁrst sentence. Don’t ques-tion me. Don’t jump to any conclusions. Just remember thisaxiom.
This means if somebody asks you, “With the Sugarman ap-
proach to copywriting, what is the purpose of the subheadline inthe ad?” don’t answer, “A subheadline is designed to give youmore information and to further explain the attention-gettingheadline.”
Neither of the above reasons is as important as the fact that
the subheadline is designed to get the reader to read the copy.
If somebody asked you for the main purpose of the logo in
an advertisement, you could answer, “To establish the corporateidentity of the company selling the product,” or you could an-swer, “To provide a degree of continuity.” But the real answer isto get you to read the copy. Really.
If you don’t believe it, have patience and I will prove it to
you. But if you’ll open your mind and just accept what I tell you,you will eventually realize that what I am saying is correct. Mostimportantly, though, when you realize this and start writing withthis in the back of your mind, you’ll be amazed at the change inyour results—whether your copy is in a print ad or on a web site.But like I said, just take my word for it now and let me prove itto you later in this book.
30UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
Each element
should lead you tothe ﬁrst sentence.
======================================== [Página 55] ========================================

If the purpose of all the elements in an ad is therefore to get you
to read the copy, then what we are really talking about is readingthe ﬁrst sentence, aren’t we? What does this tell you about theﬁrst sentence? Pretty important, isn’t it? And if the ﬁrst sentenceis pretty important, what do you hope the person who looks atyour ad does? Read it, of course. If the reader doesn’t read yourvery ﬁrst sentence, chances are that he or she won’t read yoursecond sentence.
Now if the ﬁrst sentence is so important, what can you do to
make it so compelling to read, so simple, and so interesting thatyour readers—every one of them—will read it in its entirety?The answer: Make it short.
If you look at many typical JS&A ads, you’ll notice that all
of my ﬁrst sentences are so short they almost aren’t sentences.Some typical ones might be:
Losing weight is not easy.
It’s you against a computer.It’s easy.It had to happen.Hats off to IBM.
Each sentence is so short and easy to read that your reader
starts to read your copy almost as if being sucked into it. Thinkabout the analogy of a locomotive. When the locomotive startsto chug from a standing start, it really works hard. The amountof commitment and energy that the train must exert is monumen-tal. But once the train starts to move, the next few feet becomeeasier and the next few even easier. So it is with copy.
Magazines Use This Technique
Many magazines use a variation of this technique in their arti-
cles. They start an article not with a very short sentence but
31The First Sentence Chapter 5
======================================== [Página 56] ========================================

maybe with very large type. Once they have you sucked into
reading the copy and you turn the page to read the rest of the arti-cle, you notice that the typeface has gotten smaller. But that’sokay. The purpose of the large type was to get you into the arti-cle and it worked. Now it’s up to the author to keep you readingand turning the pages.
In an advertisement, you’ve got a lot going against you un-
less the readers are genuinely interested in your product. And ifthey are, then you’ve got to really grab and keep them. So yourﬁrst sentence should be very compelling by virtue of its shortlength and ease of reading. No long multisyllabic words. Keep itshort, sweet and almost incomplete so that the reader has to readthe next sentence.
If all the elements are designed to get you to read the ﬁrst
sentence in an ad, then what is the purpose of the ﬁrst sentence?If you guessed that it is to “convey a beneﬁt or explain a fea-ture,” that would be impossible. How could a short ﬁrst sentencedo anything more than get you to read it? The correct answer is,of course, “The purpose of the ﬁrst sentence is to get you to readthe second sentence.” Nothing more, nothing less. You probablyﬁgured this one out already anyway.
The Purpose of the Next Sentence
Now if you’re starting to get a feel for my approach to copywrit-
ing and I asked you what the purpose of the second sentence isand you answered, “To get you to read the third sentence,” youwould be absolutely correct. And for those of you who missedthat last answer and I asked you what the purpose of the thirdsentence was and you answered, “To get you to read the fourthsentence,” congratulations. I think you’ve got it.
Was there any mention of beneﬁts? Or product descrip-
tion? Or unique features? Of course not. The only purpose ofthose ﬁrst few sentences in an advertisement is to get you toread the following sentences. True, you may at one point haveto start talking about product features or beneﬁts, but if you losesight of the fact that your sole purpose at the beginning of an adis to hold that reader’s attention at almost any cost, then you
32UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
======================================== [Página 57] ========================================

may lose your reader for lack of interest. Therefore we have the
third axiom:
The sole purpose of the ﬁrst sentence in an advertisement is to
get you to read the second sentence.
Just compare the situation in our ad example with a sales-
person selling somebody face-to-face. If the ﬁrst few minutes ofthe sales presentation put the prospective customer to sleep or ifthe customer stops hearing the presentation and walks away, thatsalesperson has lost everything. So in copywriting as in selling,if your reader is not riveted to every word you write in the ﬁrstfew sentences, then your chances of having that reader get to thereal sales pitch are very remote.
My most successful ads have followed this format, with
very few exceptions. What about making the sales pitch at thebeginning of an ad? This is certainly possible, of course, but thenit is often not very effective. I’ve tried putting the sales messageat the beginning of an ad. I’ve tried using every trick in the bookto prove my theory wrong and have failed at each attempt. Justremember that the sole purpose of all the elements of an ad is toget you to read the ﬁrst sentence. Make that ﬁrst sentence so easyto read that your reader is almost compelled to read it. If yougrasp this, you’ve got an awfully good start and a great under-standing of copywriting and the persuasive process.
33THE FIRST SENTENCE
Axiom 3
======================================== [Página 58] ========================================


======================================== [Página 59] ========================================

Besides holding the reader’s attention, there is another impor-
tant function we are trying to accomplish in the ﬁrst paragraphsof an advertisement and that is to create a buying environment.Let me cite an example.
Picture this. You’re a salesperson and you need to sell a
prospect. You’ve been given a choice of ﬁve environments inwhich to meet the prospect, and you must pick one.
The product you are selling is very expensive and you’ll
need at least one hour to explain and properly sell the product.The choices you have are:
1.At noon at a very fancy restaurant near the prospect’s ofﬁce.
2.After lunch in the boardroom at the ofﬁces of the prospect.
3.After work at the prospect’s health club while working out
with him.
4.In the evening with the prospect at his home while the
prospect babysits his three children.
5.Any of the four above might be an acceptable choice.
The correct answer is 5. Why? Because the correct answer
to the question “Which is the best location?” is simply “in thebest selling environment for what you have to sell.”
If the product is a piece of exercise equipment, the health
club might be perfect. If the product has something to do withparents and children, at home with the prospect and his childrenin the evening might be the perfect environment.
Now if the correct answer for the salesperson is “in the en-
vironment best suited for the selling activity,” is it true in printadvertising, too? Yes, but let me cite another example before wediscuss print advertising environments.

The Honolulu Experience
I was in Honolulu after a trip to the Far East. I usually stop at
Honolulu to recover after traveling so long and so far and overso many time zones. As I was walking down one of the mainstreets in Waikiki, I stopped to look into an art gallery and saw apainting of scenes from outer space.
Since JS&A was known for selling space-age products, I
thought that the painting would ﬁt very nicely in my ofﬁce. Iwalked into the gallery noticing how very elegant it looked andsaw the paintings neatly displayed on the wall. The gallerylooked like it sold expensive paintings. In short, I expected theprices to be high.
It didn’t take too long before a well-dressed saleswoman
noticed me, walked over and asked if I needed assistance.“Beautiful painting, isn’t it?” she asked.
“Very nice,” I nodded. “It really looks great.”At that point the lady said, “Please follow me,” as she lifted
the painting off the wall and walked toward the back of the largegallery. I followed.
We entered a large room, carpeted from ﬂoor to ceiling. In
the middle of the room were three very comfortable easy chairs allfacing the front of the room where the saleslady mounted thepainting on the wall. She then went back to the entrance of theroom, turned up the classical music being piped in through loud-speakers and dimmed the lights, leaving two spotlights focused onthe painting.
Painting Looked Incredible
I must admit that the painting looked incredible. The vibrant col-
ors, the quality of the art, and the nice feeling I experienced fromhearing the classical music put me in such a buying mood that Iwas ready to reach into my pocket and pull out my credit cardand buy the $2,000 painting.
That lady and that gallery had put me in such a focused
buying mood by creating the perfect environment for selling methat painting that I almost bought it right then and there. By theway, I eventually sponsored the artist, Mark Rickerson, and sold
36UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
======================================== [Página 61] ========================================

his paintings and prints through JS&A. I personally ended
up with 50 of his paintings. 
Once you realize the importance of setting up a buying
environment, you’ll know that it must be done in the earlystages of an advertisement. When you establish the readingmomentum at the start of an ad, you also want to start estab-lishing the buying environment as well. The saleslady ﬁrsthad to get me into the store and then slowly get me in thatroom to put me in the ideal buying mood. If this all sounds hard todo in print, it really isn’t. You’ll see examples later of how to estab-lish the buying environment as you establish the momentum.
Since you are creating your own environment in a print ad,
you have total control over its appearance. Common sense willdictate the rest.
For example, if I was selling products at a discount, I would
use big type for my prices and lots of busy graphic elements. Inshort, I would make the ad look like a typical discount ad. Andconversely, if I was selling something expensive, I would pre-sent myself in an environment that showed class and reﬁne-ment—that exuded conﬁdence and trust.
Unlike the salesperson who may or may not be able to cre-
ate the ideal selling environment, you can create your own. Andunlike the salesperson who sometimes can’t control the environ-ment, you can.
So for selling products through Battram Galleries, the col-
lectibles company I formed, my graphic and copy approach wasupscale and conservative—just what you’d expect from an expen-sive gallery. However, when I presented my Consumers Hero con-cept, a club that sold refurbished bargains, it had a totally differentenvironment—one that was clearly bargain-oriented.
The JS&A ads all had a uniform, well-organized format that
seemed to be the perfect environment for all my space-age elec-tronic products. I rarely deviated from it, but when I did, it was tocreate a better environment for a speciﬁc product I was selling.
You wouldn’t expect to buy an expensive painting from an
Army surplus store and you wouldn’t expect to ﬁnd much of abargain at Tiffany’s.
37CREATING THE PERFECT BUYING ENVIRONMENT
Your copy has 
to put the
prospect into a
relaxed buying
environment.
======================================== [Página 62] ========================================

You Control the Environment
As a writer of direct marketing, you have control over the envi-
ronment. The environment you choose is created in both thegraphic elements and the copy, but especially the copy—by theway you phrase your words, the choice of words and the level ofintegrity you convey.
Unlike a store where you spend thousands of dollars to
create an environment, you can do it all simply in the copy ofyour ad or the look of your web site.
The environment is critical in getting a prospective cus-
tomer into the buying mood. And to create that environment, youattract the customer’s attention (the headline, photos, logo, etc.)and then you’ve got to get the person to read the ﬁrst sentence bymaking it so simple and so compelling that the reader cannothelp but read it. And the next sentence and then the next.
And while the reader is reading, you are creating an envi-
ronment just as surely as that art gallery was drawing me intothat back room. So now we are ready for the fourth axiom.
Your ad layout and the ﬁrst few paragraphs of your ad must
create the buying environment most conducive to the sale ofyour product or service.
Creating the ideal buying environment comes from experi-
ence and the speciﬁc knowledge you get from studying yourproduct and potential customer. It comes from understanding thenature of your product or service. Greater understanding willcome as you read this book. But for now, realize how importantcreating the buying environment is to eventually selling yourproduct.
To understand how we get the reader not only to read, but to
feel comfortable and be in a buying mood in that environment,let’s take time out for a little lesson on personal sales ability ingeneral, in the next chapter.

Axiom 4
======================================== [Página 63] ========================================

When I was only 20 years old, my father sent me to New York
City to run the branch ofﬁce of his printing equipment company,Consolidated International. He was having ﬁnancial difﬁcultiesand I was happy to help him out after my ﬁrst two years in col-lege. I dropped out of college, and while in New York I took aninterest in salesmanship. I knew that he expected me to eventu-ally help him sell his equipment, so I set out to prepare myself.
I went to bookstores and bought everything I could on sell-
ing. I read every book available at the public library—all to be-come an expert in salesmanship. And during that year in NewYork I would stroll down Broadway and visit small auctionshops located right on Times Square.
Wonderful Sales Technique
These small auction shops would prey on unsuspecting ob-
servers by appealing to their greed. The shop’s proprietor wouldauction off what appeared to be terriﬁc bargains, hook one of theprospective bidders in the audience and create a buying frenzythat plenty of the onlookers would get sucked into. The biddersended up buying junk that wasn’t much of a bargain. The salestechniques were wonderful to watch and I spent hours just ob-serving them and human nature.
Then I would go back to my small apartment and read
more books on selling. It wasn’t easy for a young, inexperienced
20-year-old to sell expensive and complicated printing equip-ment. I thought that if I could become an expert on selling ingeneral and printing equipment in particular and then, throughexperience, pick up speciﬁc knowledge about selling the equip-ment, I could be an effective salesman for my dad.
Selling was something I was suited for. In the preference
tests I took in high school, my highest score was in a categorycalled “persuasion” and another high score was in “literary.” My
39Resonating with the Reader Chapter 7
======================================== [Página 64] ========================================

career in advertising could have been predicted even back in
high school, for when you think about it, print advertising isnothing more than “literary persuasion.”
Some of the signiﬁcant lessons I learned in New York were
the steps in selling a prospect, which also apply to selling in printadvertising. Let me review the procedure.
The ﬁrst thing you do in selling is to set up the selling envi-
ronment. Whether it be a private room in a gallery or a cardealer’s showroom, you conﬁgure the physical environment tobe your selling environment. 
Next, you have to get the attention of the prospect. That 
certainly makes sense and is related to the headline of a print ad.
Once you have the prospect’s attention, the next step is to
introduce yourself and say something that will keep the atten-tion of the prospect. This is similar to the subheadline and thephotos and captions. Then comes the sales pitch or the copy ina print ad.
During this activity, the seller has two thoughts in mind.
The ﬁrst is that the buyer must like and develop conﬁdence inthe seller. The buyer must believe that the seller knows the prod-uct. Second, the seller must somehow relate the product to thebuyer and the buyer’s needs. That’s clear. But the buyer and theseller must vibrate together. There must be a harmony struck be-tween the buyer and seller, or the persuasive sales messagewon’t come through.
There are many methods for creating this
harmony and two of the most important applyvery directly to space advertising. First, you’vegot to get the prospective reader to start sayingyes. Second, you’ve got to make statementsthat are both honest and believable. Let’s citean example. A car salesman says, “Nice day,Mr. Jones.” Mr. Jones then answers, “Yes.” (Itis a nice day, the statement is truthful and thecustomer answers in the afﬁrmative.) 
“I see, Mr. Jones, that you keep your car very clean.” “Yes, I
do.” (At this point, the salesman has Mr. Jones saying yes andnodding his head.) “I see, Mr. Jones, that since you now own a
40UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
Get the customer
to nod in theafﬁrmative andagree with you.
======================================== [Página 65] ========================================

Buick and we sell Buicks, you probably could use a
new one?” “Yes.” (The salesman asks a rather obvi-ous question and Mr. Jones, nodding, replies in theafﬁrmative.)
“May I show you one of our latest models
with improvements over the model you currentlyown?” “Yes.” (The salesman once again says the obvious to get a yes answer, and the harmonycontinues.)
In short, you try to get the customer to nod his or her head
in the afﬁrmative and agree with you, or at least you make truth-ful statements that the prospect knows are correct and wouldconcur with. Make sure that the prospect does not disagree withsomething you’re saying. If for example the salesman said,“Could you use a new Buick?” and the customer said “No,” thesale would have taken a bad turn right there and the harmonywould have been lost. In a print ad, the reader would havestopped reading and turned the page.
Harmony Is the Key
The moment you get the reader to say “No” or even “I really
don’t believe what he is saying” or “I don’t think that relates tome,” you’ve lost the reader. But as long as the reader keeps say-ing yes or believes what you are saying is correct and continuesto stay interested, you are going to be harmonizing with thereader and you and the reader will be walking down that path to-ward that beautiful room in the art gallery.
To show you a speciﬁc approach to this method, let’s take
an example from an ad I wrote for one of my seminar partici-pants. Entitled “Food Crunch,” it offered dehydrated survivalfood. On occasion, when one of my students wrote a good adthat did not succeed, I would help him or her by either sug-gesting minor copy changes or sometimes rewriting the entiread myself if I felt I had a better overall concept. The ﬁrst ad,by John Sauer, was written right after our major fuel crunch in1973, when there were lines of cars at gas pumps that had littleor no fuel to pump. The ad is shown on the next page with myad above it. John chose the concept of insurance as the bestapproach in his ad. I felt that insurance put people to sleep.
41RESONATING WITH THE READER
Get your reader to
say “Yes.”
======================================== [Página 66] ========================================

See if you agree with the copy statements in my ad as I
tie in the then-current feelings of helplessness duringthe fuel shortage with John’s product. 
We all take our food supply for granted. And for good
reason. Americans have always had plenty. But we maybe heading for one of the most serious periods in our his-tory. Let me explain. 
The ad then goes on to explain the writer’s ﬁrst-
hand experience of arriving at a supermarket right af-ter the news of the Kennedy assassination only todiscover that the shelves were bare and that people intime of distress or calamity think ﬁrst of their own survival.
Notice that the reader’s attention was riveted. The
headline, “Food Crunch,” and subheadline, “We’ve all
experienced the fuel shortage and most of us were unpre-pared. Will you be prepared for the food crunch?” causedus to read the ﬁrst sentence. The ﬁrst sentence was shortand the typical American who could afford this offerwould nod his or her head in the afﬁrmative. The sen-tences were both interesting and true and caused thereader to start nodding his or her head.
So now we have three things we are trying to do
at the beginning of an ad. First we want the reader toread the copy. Remember, that’s the objective of allcopy. Without the prospect reading the ad, you havenothing.
Then we create the type of environment through
copy that causes the prospect to feel comfortable in ex-changing his or her hard-earned money for your prod-uct or service. And ﬁnally, we want the prospect to
harmonize with us—to agree with us—by feeling that indeedwe are saying something that is truthful, interesting and infor-mative and that the prospect can agree with. In short, we wantagreement. We want that head to nod in the afﬁrmative. Wewant harmony.
42UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
Which ad would 
you read ﬁrst right after the fuel crunch?
======================================== [Página 67] ========================================

Look what Cycle magazine did to create the perfect
harmony with me when they tried to get me to buy mediain their magazine. They created a knockoff of my ad for-mat and sent it to me with a copy style that resembledmine. Of course it could have backﬁred if I was upset thatthey were copying me, but they also knew that I wouldquickly recognize the format and the effort they weremaking to land me as a customer and that I would respecttheir creativity. Indeed I harmonized with their effort andbought some space in their magazine.
Another illustration of this concept is in the ad I
wrote trying to appeal to bargain hunters for a companycalled Consumers Hero. After a few sentences the copyread as follows:
Consumers are being robbed. Inﬂation is stealing our
purchasing power. Our dollars are shrinking in value.The poor average consumer is plundered, robbed andstepped on.
If you were a consumer looking for bargains when inﬂation
was skyrocketing during the years when I wrote this, you wouldvery likely be in harmony after that brief paragraph. I usedwords that the consumer could relate to. I spoke in the con-sumer’s language.
A top-producing salesman once said to me, “Joe, I really
admire you. I can sell anybody on a one-to-one basis. Put me upagainst the toughest customers and I’ll melt them down and sellthem. But you have the ability to do that on a scale that dwarfsmine. When you sell, you manage to duplicate yourself and sellmillions of people all at the same time.”
And that’s what is so incredible about selling in print. You
can duplicate yourself on billions of pages. You’ve got to be ableto reproduce a selling job in print that will harmonize with theconsumer, and then you’ve got the essence of a powerful toolthat will bring you rewards for the rest of your life in all forms ofcommunication whether they be in print or on TV or in any ofthe new electronic media of the future.
43RESONATING WITH THE READER
This is the ad that
Cycle magazine
created as a sales
tool to harmonize
with JS&A and
convince us to buy.
======================================== [Página 68] ========================================

So our ﬁfth axiom is simply:
Get the reader to say yes and harmonize with your accurate
and truthful statements while reading your copy.
Now you have the basis for another very important princi-
ple in writing effective copy.
44UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
Axiom 5
======================================== [Página 69] ========================================

By now you have learned several very important points about
copywriting. First, you learned that you have, in your life, expe-rienced general knowledge through your actions, circumstancesand personality. You have also been given the tools to obtainspeciﬁc knowledge, such as the ability to inquire, read and re-search. Then you learned that practice is a great teacher—thatthe more you write, the better you get. And ﬁnally you learnedthat copywriting is the mental process of transferring what is inyour head onto a sheet of paper.
Then we got into the pure Sugarman stuff. We learned
what most people think elements like the headline and captionsdo for a typical ad. And then we learned what I believe theirprimary purpose is: to get the reader to read the ﬁrstsentence.
And if you remember, we said that the sole pur-
pose of the ﬁrst sentence is to get prospects to readthe second sentence and that the sole purpose of thesecond sentence is to get them to read the third and then thefourth—all while you are building a selling environment forthe sale of your product.
We also compared the selling process in print to what a live
and in-person salesperson does. You learned that ideally, as yourreader starts reading your copy, you get the reader to start nod-ding in agreement with everything you say.
So now the reader is reading your ﬁrst few sentences, is
feeling comfortable in the environment you have created and isnodding in agreement. Now comes the critical part called the“slippery slide.”
Picture a steep slide at a playground. Now picture some-
body putting baby oil or grease along the entire length of theslide including the side rails. Picture yourself now climbing up
45The Slippery Slide Chapter 8
Every element
must be so 
compelling that

falling down a
slippery slide
unable to stop
until you reach
the end.

======================================== [Página 70] ========================================

the ladder, sitting at the top of the slide and then letting gravity
force you down the slide.
As you start to slide down and build momentum, you try
holding on to the sides to stop, but you can’t stop. You continueto slide down the slide despite all your efforts to prevent yourdescent. This is the way your copy must ﬂow.
Every element in an advertisement must cause that slippery
slide effect. The headline must be so powerful and compellingthat you must read the subheadline, and the subheadline must beso powerful that you are compelled to read the ﬁrst sentence, andthe ﬁrst sentence must be so easy to read and so compelling thatyou must read the next sentence and so on, straight through theentire copy to the end.
The Force of “Reading Gravity”
I once received a letter from a reader of Scientiﬁc American
magazine in response to one of our ads on thermostats. Thelady who sent me the typewritten letter told me that she had noneed for a thermostat, was not interested in the subject, rarelyreads advertisements and when she does, she just scans throughthem. But, she went on, “I am a busy scientist. When I startedreading your ad, I wasted ﬁve minutes of my valuable timereading the entire thing and I was so upset at the completewaste of my time, that I wanted to write you and complain.” Asa copywriter, I couldn’t have gotten a more complimentarycomplaint letter.
If you can get the majority of the people who scan a maga-
zine to read your ad, maybe you won’t sell every one of them butyou will sell a good percentage. Creating the slippery slide willcause people to “trafﬁc” your ad—to go through the entire textof your ad and then decide if they want to buy.
Trafﬁc is a good word in retail selling. Any shopping center
that can draw increased trafﬁc will have increased sales for itsstores. But the trafﬁc generated by these stores can only be com-pared to the people who actually read your copy. That’s whysome of the greatest magazines with the largest circulations donot guarantee the success of your advertisement. Trafﬁc is strictlythe number of people who get into your copy. When I say “get
46UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
======================================== [Página 71] ========================================

into,” I mean falling down the slippery slide all the way through
to the end of your copy.
Creating the slippery slide effect is not that difﬁcult once
the reader is well into your copy. In fact, it’s been proven that if areader reads more than 25 percent of your ad, there is a greatprobability that he or she will read the entire ad. So once you’vegrabbed your reader at the start of your ad with your perfect en-vironment and once they’re reading your compelling ﬁrst sen-tence, you’ve got them started down the slippery slide.
Slippery Slide Examples
Let’s look at a few examples of the use of the slippery slide in
some of the advertising I’ve written through the years. I referredto the thermostat ad earlier, so let’s start with that. The copystarts out with the following headline, subheadline and ﬁrst twoparagraphs:
Headline: Magic Baloney
Subheadline: You’ll love the way we hated the Magic Stat ther-
mostat until an amazing thing happened.
Picture Caption: It had no digital readout, an ugly case and a
stupid name. It almost made us sick.
Copy: You’re probably expecting our typical sales pitch, but get
ready for a shock. For instead of trying to tell you what a greatproduct the Magic Stat thermostat is, we’re going to tear it apart.Unmercifully.
When we ﬁrst saw the Magic Stat, we took one look at the name
and went, “Yuck.” We took one look at the plastic case and said,“How cheap looking.” And when we looked for the digital read-out, it had none. So before the salesman even showed us how itworked, we were totally turned off.
Now if you’re reading the above ad, you’re starting down
the slippery slide unable to stop. You might ﬁnd yourself readingthe copy even though you have no intention of buying a thermo-stat by mail. You’re curious. What’s the gimmick?
The environment was set by the very clean layout. The tone
of the ad was one of a ﬂip, sarcastic and skeptical company ex-ploring the possibility of selling a product that we were not veryimpressed with.
47THE SLIPPERY SLIDE
======================================== [Página 72] ========================================

Of course the rest of the ad told of how we discovered a few
nice points and then a few more and then some really great fea-tures and ﬁnally decided that this was one great product. At theend of the ad, we ﬁnished with:
Beauty is only skin deep and a name doesn’t really mean that
much. But we sure wish those guys at Magic Stat would havenamed their unit something more impressive. Maybe somethinglike Twinkle Temp.
That single ad ran more than three years and not only gen-
erated large volume for us but propelled the Magic Stat people to become one of the major thermostat contenders nationwide. 
Another example of the slippery slide theory is in my ad for
a company I started that sold bargains, called Consumers Hero.
Picture yourself scanning through a magazine and coming
across the following copy:
Headline: HOT
Subheadline: A new consumer concept lets you buy stolen mer-
chandise if you’re willing to take a risk.
Highlighted Copy Block: Impossible-to-trace Guarantee—We
guarantee that our stolen products will look like brand-newmerchandise without any trace of previous brand identiﬁcation or ownership.
Well, if you’re like most readers, you had to start reading
the copy. How could you help but read it?
Copy: We developed an exciting new consumer marketing con-
cept. It’s called “stealing.” That’s right, stealing!
Now if that sounds bad, look at the facts. Consumers are being
robbed. Inﬂation is stealing our purchasing power. Our dollarsare shrinking in value. The poor average consumer is plundered,robbed and stepped on.
So the poor consumer tries to strike back. First, he forms con-
sumer groups. He lobbies in Washington. He ﬁghts price in-creases. He looks for value.
So we developed our new concept around value. Our idea was
to steal from the rich companies and give to the poor con-sumer, save our environment and maybe, if we’re lucky, makea buck.

I then went into the concept, which was our plan to take de-
fective merchandise, repair it and then make it available to theconsumers through a club that cost $5 to join. Newsletters weresent to members offering the products. One of the paragraphsnear the end of the ad summed it up beautifully:
So that’s our concept. We recycle “lousy rotten” garbage into su-
per new products with ﬁve-year warranties. We steal from therich manufacturers and give to the poor consumer. We work hardand make a glorious proﬁt.
The Magic Stat and Consumers Hero ad examples are but
two of the many I’ve written through the years that illustrate theslippery slide theory. Once you start reading the headline, whichforces you eventually down to the ﬁrst sentence, you are in myslide. And then I take you all the way to the bottom of that slideso before you know it you’ve read the entire ad. You’ve been inmy store; you entered and didn’t get out until you fully exam-ined the merchandise I offered you. I took you into my privateroom and gave you a demonstration of my product in an envi-ronment that was so compelling, you couldn’t help but buy. AndI did it with integrity and honesty while getting you to nod yourhead as I sold you.
That’s what the slippery slide is all about: getting your reader
to read all of the copy. So a major axiom of mine is simply:
Your readers should be so compelled to read your copy that
they cannot stop reading until they read all of it as if slidingdown a slippery slide.
As we explained earlier, one of the most important ele-
ments in creating the slippery slide is the start of your ad copy. Ioften will start my copy with a story or even pick up a piece ofnews from a magazine that I feel would be of interest to myreaders. The story is often offbeat, always interesting and a greatshort story.
A good example of this technique is the story about a
trusted accountant who was caught embezzling money from hiscompany. Here’s the copy I wrote based on that article and thevery unusual connection I made to the product I was selling:
49THE SLIPPERY SLIDE
Axiom 6
======================================== [Página 74] ========================================

Headline: Last Wish
Subheadline: He was a prisoner conﬁned to a cell block. “Give
him one last wish,” pleaded his wife.
Copy: George Johnson is in a state penitentiary for a white-col-
lar crime. His seven-year sentence gives him plenty of time toexercise.
Johnson, 36 years old, always took care of himself. He exercised
regularly, ate good food and took vitamins. But he got greedy. Asa company accountant he kept issuing bogus checks to “CashinElectric Company” for electrical contracting work.
One day his boss noticed the large payments being made to the
Cashin Electric Company and discovered that the outﬁt didn’texist. Johnson was actually typing out checks to “Cash,” cashingthem himself and then after the checks cleared the bank and werereturned to his company, he carefully typed on the checks “inElectric Company” after the word “Cash.” Since he was a trustedaccountant, who would suspect?
WIFE MORE SYMPATHETIC
His wife was more sympathetic than was the judge. She wantedto help her husband and suggested he pick an exercise productfor his cell—something that was easy to store and could give hima complete workout. And the prison agreed. Johnson chose a Pre-cor precision rower. Here’s why.
I then described the Precor rower and how beneﬁcial it
was for your entire body, how it stored easily out of the wayand why George selected the product for his primary exer-cise device.
Later in the ad I admitted the liberty I had taken with the
story out of frustration. The copy ended with the following:
Before I tell you which rower Johnson selected, I have a confes-
sion to make. I love the Precor line of rowers so much that Iprobably committed a crime too. The story about Cashin ElectricCompany is true. Some trusted accountant was sent to prison.But his name wasn’t Johnson and his wife never called JS&A toorder a thing, let alone a rower.
But one night, while I was trying my hardest to ﬁgure out a new
way to share my enthusiasm for the Precor rowers, I started get-ting a little silly and concocted this dumb story about Johnsonand his interest in the rower. Copywriting is not easy and some-times you go a little bonkers.
50UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
======================================== [Página 75] ========================================

I then ﬁnished the ad with a selection of rowers and my
usual close. In this case the offbeat article about Cashin ElectricCompany had nothing to do with the product I was offering butit created a very strong beginning for my slippery slide.
The news item could have nothing to do with your product
or it could tie in perfectly. For example, I was reading Forbes
magazine, and in the “Informer” section there was an article en-titled “Growth Market.” The copy read as follows:
It looks like U.S. underwear manufacturers have overlooked a
potential growth market. According to a survey of 1,000 adultBrits conducted by London-based Survey Research Associates,one in ten British men wears the same underpants two or threedays running. One in a hundred wears the same pair all week.Half the women polled said they kept wearing underwear after itwent gray with age.
I would cut out articles just like this one and keep a collec-
tion of them. And then when appropriate, I would use one ofthem to begin an ad that somewhat related to the news item. 
For example, I was in England appearing on QVC, the TV
home shopping network. QVC has a branch ofﬁce in Englandand I often appeared on TV selling my products there. While inthe lounge waiting to go on the air, I met a man who showed mea new product he was presenting called Scrub Balls. They weresimply nine golfball-sized spheres that you put in your washingmachine with your laundry. They sloshed around scrubbing theclothes to bring out more dirt and make the clothes cleaner andwhiter. They also saved on detergent and made your clothescleaner while using less water. If I were marketing that productin print, I might pull out that Forbes article and start my ad with
something like the following:
Headline: British Men Have Underwear Problem
Subheadline: New survey shows that many British men do not
change their underwear for up to three days, and some even aslong as a week.
Copy: Holy Odor Eaters! Has Britain got a problem. It seems
that the men in Britain don’t change their underwear often andthe survey mentioned above shows that many men change theirunderwear just once a week. But there’s an important questionI’d like to ask you.
51THE SLIPPERY SLIDE
======================================== [Página 76] ========================================

How often do you change yours? If you’re like most Americans,
you change it every day. And as an American, you probably usemore detergent than most Britons. But there is one more surprisethat you may not realize, either. Americans have a serious wasteproblem. Let me explain.
I would then go on to explain how we waste our resources
by not efﬁciently washing our clothes and that there was thisproduct I discovered in England called Scrub Balls and howefﬁciently it cleaned your clothes with less water and laundrydetergent.
I could also use the same article to sell an electronic product
simply by saying: 
Now you probably wonder what dirty British underwear
has to do with this new pocket-sized computer. I’m gladyou asked. It has nothing to do with it except for one impor-tant fact that I will reveal shortly. But ﬁrst let me explain anunimportant fact.
I would then go into the computer features, play-
ing off British men, and I would use odor or smell torelate to some of the computer features. I would thencome up with a computer feature at the end of the adthat would tie into the story.
Save Those Articles
I realize that it may seem a little far-fetched to sell a
rower tied into an embezzlement story or a computer
using that Forbes article on British underwear habits. But the
point I am making is simply this: The use of an interesting articleor bit of information, when tied into your product or service, of-ten makes for a good start to the slippery slide. And whenblended nicely with your product, it can work to cause a readerto read every bit of your copy. So save those offbeat articles youcome across that tweak your interest and might interest yourreaders—regardless of how ridiculous or offbeat they may be.
Some magazines create the slippery slide by simply starting
out their stories with larger type to get you into the copy. Largertype is easier to read and so you tend to start reading the copy,

Quest/80 maga-
zine startedtheir featurestory on the cover to hook thereaders and getthem interested.

which may seem less imposing. Quest/80 magazine (no longer
around) started the copy of an article on the front cover and thencontinued it inside the magazine to get you into their slipperyslide. Many articles written for magazines use similar graphicelements to get you into their stories. Of course, the key is tomake the copy so compelling that once you start reading it, youcan’t put it down. And there are even more techniques to createthe slippery slide that I will cover later in this book.
You’re now in store for some fun. For in the next few chap-
ters, I’m going to stretch your imagination and then continue tobuild the foundation we’ve been building in Section One of thisbook. So stay with me as we cover the timely topic of assumedconstraints.
53THE SLIPPERY SLIDE
======================================== [Página 78] ========================================

Have you ever looked at a circus elephant anchored to the
ground? If you have, you might notice that the elephant has ametal collar around its leg to which is attached a small chain.And the chain is attached to a wooden peg driven into theground. Pretty good protection?
Pretty lousy, if you ask me. That 12,000-pound elephant
could very easily pick up its foot and with one fell swoop yankthe peg out of the ground and walk away. But the elephantdoesn’t. Why? I’ll explain.
When that elephant was still a baby, that same collar and
chain and peg were used to hold the elephant in place. The re-straint was sufﬁcient to hold the baby elephant in place even if itwanted to break away. And break away is indeed what the babyelephant tried to do.
So every day while the baby was chained up, it would pull
at the chain and pull and pull until ﬁnally a cut appeared on itsleg exposing the sore sensitive layers of deep skin tissue. It hurtto pull like that and soon the baby elephant, realizing the effortwas both futile and painful, stopped trying to escape.
Elephants Never Forget
As the baby elephant grew older, it never forgot that bad experi-
ence with the chain and the peg. And so whenever it was an-chored down in a spot, it would think, “Hey, it’s impossible tobreak away and besides, it hurts.” 
The adult elephant had what I call an “assumed constraint.”
And all of us have the same problem to one degree or another.We all have the power to be great copywriters. But at one point inour lives, we may have written something and gotten a bad gradein English. Or we may have attempted to communicate some-thing in writing to somebody else and had a bad experience as aresult. As we’ve grown older, those hurt feelings, the feelings of
55Assumed Constraints Chapter 9
======================================== [Página 80] ========================================

inadequacy and the wrong guidance we may have received from
teachers or friends are still in our subconscious, and whether wewant to admit it or not, they really do affect us.
If you understand the hurt and you understand some of the
constraints we put upon ourselves, then you are better able tocope with breaking out of those assumed constraints and becom-ing anything you want to be and accomplishing anything youwant to accomplish. Let me cite some examples.
One of the best is the following nine-point puzzle. I gave
this puzzle to my students as an example of an assumed con-straint. The rules to solve this puzzle are very simple. You mustdraw four straight lines and connect all the points without takingyour pen off the page. In short, all the lines have to be connected.Please do the puzzle before reading on.
Most people who try to solve the puzzle
make one fatal error and it is simply that theydon’t realize the constraint they subconsciouslyput upon themselves. The solution is in Appen-dix A on page 317. Turn to it now for the answer.
As you can see, you were constrained by
the box surrounding the points and did not goout of the box in order to ﬁnd the solution. Of-ten, to solve that very important problem,you’ve got to go out of the problem area itselfto ﬁnd the answer.
A good example of assumed constraints
was my choice of mailing lists for my ﬁrst directmailing when I sold the ﬁrst pocket calculator by
mail. I had to select 10 mailing lists for my 50,000-piece mailingand I picked eight good lists that made a lot of sense to me.
I selected engineers, accountants and surveyors, for example.
I selected wealthy people at their home addresses. I chose the mailorder buyers from a certain catalog that sold similar products. Butwhen it came to the last two lists, my list broker suggested thepresidents of corporations with $20 million in sales or more.
I thought the idea really didn’t make sense. I thought that the
presidents of these companies would be so busy that more thanlikely they wouldn’t even open their own mail and that some secre-

connect the dots in this puzzle withfour straight lineswithout taking your pen off the paper.
======================================== [Página 81] ========================================

tary would throw my mailing in the garbage. But I went along with
the list broker and to my surprise, those lists he suggested turnedout to be the best ones, while the others really pulled poorly.
I can point to hundreds of assumed constraint examples that
I personally experienced. Here are ﬁve of them:
1.“You can’t sell your airplane for over $190,000.” I sold it for
$240,000 in 10 days.
2.“You can’t sell a $600 pinball game through the mail.” We
sold more than 3,000 of them.
3.“Consumers will rip you off if you let them buy using their
credit cards over a toll-free line without having them sign any-thing.” We launched toll-free order taking in the United Statesand were very successful with very few problems beforeeverybody else caught on.
4.“This calculator isn’t selling at all at retail. It’s the biggest
bomb in calculator history. How are you going to sell it viamail order?” We sold over 30,000 of them at $59.95.
5.“Who would buy sunglasses through the mail? People need to
try them on ﬁrst, and besides, people buy different styles.” Wesold more than 10 million pairs of the same style.
Or how about the following three business examples of
other historical assumed constraints:
1.“There is no reason anyone would want a computer in their
home.” This was said by Ken Olsen, president, chairman andfounder of Digital Equipment Corporation, in 1977.
2.“Computers in the future may weigh no more than 1.5 tons.”
This was quoted by Popular Mechanics magazine forecasting
the relentless march of science in 1949.
3.“The concept is interesting and well-formed, but in order to
earn better than a ‘C,’ the idea must be feasible.” This wassaid by a Yale University management professor in responseto Fred Smith’s paper proposing reliable overnight deliveryservice. Smith then went on to found FedEx.
If you’d like to read more examples of assumed constraints,
look in Appendix A, which lists other historical quotes.
57ASSUMED CONSTRAINTS
======================================== [Página 82] ========================================

You Never Really Know
I can give you dozens of examples from history and from our
company or from friends, but my point is simple. You never re-ally know what will work or what won’t. If you believe in youridea, do it. Step out of those assumed constraints.
This concept also applies to coming up with marketing so-
lutions. When thinking about a problem or looking for a solu-tion, don’t rule anything out. Sometimes that big idea will cometo you if you step out of the traps that we very often fall into. Re-member Edward de Bono’s concept of lateral thinking, which issomewhat the opposite of assumed constraints. Step away fromthe problem, think of some possible situations that have nothingto do with the problem and guess what? You’ll be amazed at howoften you ﬁnd a solution.
As you proceed in this book, remember the baby elephant
and the nine-point puzzle and break out of those assumed con-straints.
When trying to solve problems, don’t assume constraints that
aren’t really there.

Axiom 7
======================================== [Página 83] ========================================

We have already learned that trafﬁc is a key word to any re-
tailer. A shopping center that increases trafﬁc will generally seean increase in sales for its stores. And since the trafﬁc generatedby these stores can only be compared to getting a prospect intoyour copy, you increase trafﬁc by increasing readership. 
One way to increase readership is by applying a theory I call
“seeds of curiosity.” It goes like this. At the end of a paragraph, Iwill often put a very short sentence that offers some reason forthe reader to read the next paragraph. I use sentences such as:
But there’s more.
So read on.But I didn’t stop there.Let me explain.Now here comes the good part.
These seeds of curiosity cause you to subconsciously con-
tinue reading even though you might be at a point in the copywhere the copy slows down. This concept is used a lot on TV be-fore the show host goes to a commercial. She may say, “Whenwe come back, we’ll see something that you’ve never seen onTV before. Stay tuned.” Well, it should be done in print, too. Andhere’s why. (Notice how I just used it.)
In print, the ideal situation is to create such interesting and
compelling copy that you don’t need the seeds of curiosity, butoften that is very difﬁcult. And using these seeds of curiosity en-hances most copy. But like every good thing, don’t overdo it.Later in this book I will be showing examples of seeds of curios-ity at work in many of my ads. Use them; they are very effective.But there’s another example.
Seeds of curiosity can be used at the beginning of an ad
where you mention some beneﬁt or payoff that you are going toreveal somewhere in your copy. In short, the reader has to readthe entire ad to ﬁnd it. A good example of this technique was in
59Seeds of Curiosity Chapter 10
======================================== [Página 84] ========================================

our Consumers Hero ad mentioned in Chapter 8 and reproduced
in Chapter 34. In that ad, you had to read the entire copy beforeyou got to the punch line.
A great example of both seeds of curiosity and trafﬁc is what
happened to me at my ofﬁce. It’s something that I’ve quite franklynever experienced again but it is very relevant to this subject.
A Very Unusual Call
I received a call one day from a very sensuous-sounding young
woman who called herself Ginger. She started the conversationwith: “Mr. Sugarman, I love you.”
I was a little taken aback and at ﬁrst thought that this was a
practical joke. “Thank you,” I responded. “I love you, too.”
“No, I’m serious,” continued the woman. “I’ve been reading
your advertisements for the past ﬁve years and I love your mind, Ilove your thought process and I love your creative personality. Ireally believe that I can tell a great deal about you from what youwrite and I really believe in you and truly love you.”
I was surprised and then ﬂattered. Even before I received her
call, I had gotten comments from people who claimed that mypersonality really came through in my copy. And I believed it.
If you are dishonest, it is sensed by the reader. If you are
hiding something about a product you are describing, it comesthrough. If you’re very creative, it, too, is picked up. And it is thecombination of all of these impressions that creates the buyingenvironment that we referred to in Chapter 6. 
If you study the copy of others, you can sense what they are
like from their copy. You’ll be amazed at how the copy reﬂectsthe personality of the person writing it. Any copywriter workingfor a CEO of a company will try to reﬂect the personality of theCEO and not him- or herself. Since I’m the guy who writes allthe copy, you can pretty well tell a lot about my personality. Butback to Ginger.
An Invitation I Couldn’t Refuse
Was Ginger just ﬂattering me or did she have an emotional at-
tachment to me personally without having met me—strictlyfrom reading my copy? She continued.
“Mr. Sugarman, you are the only one who could help me. I
60UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
======================================== [Página 85] ========================================

need your help. Please, may I have an appointment to see you,
privately? I promise you that you’ll be very glad to see me.”
When she arrived at my ofﬁce I could see what she meant
when she said that I’d be glad to see her. She was a beautifulblonde with long legs and a miniskirt so short I was embarrassedto have her sit down. “Mr. Sugarman, may I call you Joe?”
“Sure,” I replied, looking away as she adjusted her skirt.“Joe, I want to be very frank with you. I have admired your
copywriting for years. I’m not even into electronics and gadgetsbut I enjoy so much what you do in print that quite frankly I havea real emotional attachment to you. I know this sounds silly butwhen I got in trouble, I couldn’t think of anybody else who couldhelp me but you. I really need you.”
She paused for a moment as if to hold back tears. She then
continued.
“I run a beauty shop in a shopping center. I know that when
the shopping center is full, I get a percentage of that trafﬁc and theybuy my cosmetics. I also know that when the shopping center isempty, I get a smaller number of people who come to my store. It’salmost directly proportional to the trafﬁc in the shopping center.
“So Joe, when I decided to offer my cosmetics in a direct
mailing, I thought that if I sent out 50,000 mailing pieces, I wouldget a certain percentage of response and I would make a proﬁt. AllI needed was half a percent return rate to make a nice proﬁt.
“I then invested all the money I had to get this 50,000-piece
mailing out. I borrowed from my friends. When I launched themailing, the results were so bad I couldn’t believe it. I ended upwith one-tenth of what I needed to break even. I need you to lookover my mailing piece and just tell me what went wrong with it.And Joe, if you could help me get it to work, I’d be extremelygrateful.”
What Was Her Angle?
Was I being propositioned in return for my help? Was this all a
ploy or a guilt trip to get me to write her next mailing piece? Iwas a happily married man with two children and quite busyrunning my own business. And quite frankly, I didn’t like theidea of somebody trying to use guilt or sex or anything else to
61SEEDS OF CURIOSITY
======================================== [Página 86] ========================================

entice me to write copy or do a mailing piece. Still somewhat re-
served, I said, “Show me the mailing piece.”
Ginger reached for her purse, which was on the ﬂoor, and as
she reached, she exposed even more of her legs. I was convincedshe was in my ofﬁce to seduce me. No question about it now. Iwas convinced that she was determined to entice me into writingcopy for her. But I wondered how far she would go. I was soonto ﬁnd out.
She pulled out her mailing piece and handed it to me. I ex-
amined it for a few minutes, read the copy and studied the entirepackage. I also asked her which mailing list she used. “From theentire local area served by the beauty shop,” she said. 
I looked at the mailing again and saw many problems. She
was using a mail-in offer yet her mailing list was not oriented to-ward mail order buyers—just the retail community—so it wasno wonder her mailing didn’t work. Even the copy in the letterwas very poorly written. It was a horrible presentation. It wasn’tthat it looked bad, but it violated many of the principles I discussin this book and some that apply to direct mail. I told her the pre-sentation was not very good and that I wasn’t surprised that thepiece did so badly.
You already know the principles on trafﬁc. You already
know from previous examples that unless the recipients read allof her copy, the mailing most likely won’t work. Of course, shealso used the wrong mailing list and that didn’t help, either.
I Explained the Problems
After I explained to Ginger the problems with her mailing piece
and mailing list, I brought out another very important fact aboutdirect response advertising. “You can’t spend that kind of moneywithout testing. That’s one of your problems, too. You just mailedto too big a list. You could have picked just 5,000 names and not50,000 names for your mailing. And then you would have knownif the mailing was successful without risking too much money.”
I ﬁnished talking and there was a short pause. As she looked
straight into my eyes, she said, “Can you help me? I mean reallyhelp me? Like write the copy for the mailing piece, help me pickthe proper list and guide me as my mentor?”
62UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
======================================== [Página 87] ========================================

Since I was a little turned off by Ginger’s use of sex and guilt
to get me to do her piece, I responded, “Ginger, I really don’t havethe time. Plus, I have established a seminar in the north woods ofWisconsin where I take 20 people and teach them as a group. I justdon’t have the time to help you on an individual basis.”
A Shock I Never Expected
What Ginger whispered to me next took me totally by surprise.
In fact, there have been very few times in my life when I havebeen at a complete loss for words. But wait. This is a book oncopywriting and not about the secret goings-on behind the doorsof successful direct marketing executives who are perceived bybeautiful cosmetic executives as the answer to their dreams. “Awshucks,” you’re probably saying. “Why doesn’t he ﬁnish thedamn story and tell us what happened?”
Okay, I will. But not here. I want you to continue uninter-
rupted with my thought process on copywriting, so I have de-voted Appendix B on page 319 to the rest of the story—anepisode that actually took place in my ofﬁce and that could bepart of a very steamy novel.
Once you understand the concept of trafﬁc in retailing and
how it relates to direct marketing, then you should realize howimportant the slippery slide concept is in getting the reader toread the entire text of your ad. And one of the most powerfultechniques to keep your slippery slide greased is the use of seedsof curiosity. Your readers must get into your copy. They mustread your headline and be so compelled to read further that theyread your subheadline. Then they must be so moved that theyread your ﬁrst sentence. And the rest of the copy must be so com-pelling that by the time your prospects read 50 percent of your ad,they are helplessly caught in a slippery slide and can’t escape.
Once you understand the slippery slide and the seeds of cu-
riosity, you will have two of the most powerful copywriting toolsyou can use.
Keep the copy interesting and the reader interested through
the power of curiosity.
63SEEDS OF CURIOSITY
Axiom 8
======================================== [Página 88] ========================================


======================================== [Página 89] ========================================

Up to now we have covered some general principles of copy-
writing. You learned that all the elements of an advertisement aredesigned to get prospects to read the ﬁrst sentence, and weshowed you how to get them to start reading your copy by creating a very simple ﬁrst sentence. And then we told you howimportant it is to get the second sentence read and the third andso forth. We mentioned nothing about beneﬁts or features of aproduct because the sole purpose of the copy was to ﬁrst get people to read the copy. The beneﬁts come later.
And then we covered the environment you create at the be-
ginning of your copy. We explained the importance of resonatingwith your reader by getting the reader to say yes, believe you oragree with your assumptions.
We expressed the importance of the reader slipping through
your copy as if on a slippery slide—reading the copy so they cantrafﬁc your ad—and we gave the example of Ginger and herfailed mailing. And we just showed you how seeds of curiositywork to keep the slippery slide fully greased.
You’ve Learned Most of My Concept
Armed with the above principles, you have a major portion of
the overall philosophy of my copywriting concept. There areonly a few more points to learn to have the complete foundationupon which you can build your skills and write great copy.
I can still remember the ﬁrst seminar when I taught these
same philosophies. At the end of the course, a Texas farmernamed Frank Schultz, inspired by the seminar, shut himself in aroom at the nearby Holiday Inn motel and wrote his ﬁrst ad forthe grapefruit he wanted to sell nationally in a print campaign inmajor magazines.
His very ﬁrst space ad was so powerful that it sold more fruit
than he could pick and ship. He received letters from other promi-nent copywriters congratulating him on his simple yet beautiful

ad. We’ll study that ad in Chapter 24, but if knowledge of the
principles I teach can make a Texas farmer a great copywriter, itcan do the same for you.
Emotion in Advertising 
This chapter is about emotion in advertising. And there are just
three points to remember about the subject.
Emotion Principle 1: Every word has an emotion associated
with it and tells a story.
Emotion Principle 2: Every good ad is an emotional outpour-
ing of words, feelings and impressions. 
Emotion Principle 3: You sell on emotion, but you justify a
purchase with logic.
Let’s take the last point ﬁrst. Why do you think people buy
the Mercedes-Benz automobile in the United States? Is it becauseof the rack and pinion steering or the antilock braking system orthe safety features? Other cars have the same features, so whyspend a fortune to buy one when, for a fraction of the cost of aMercedes, you can get an American or Japanese car or even aV olvo that has many of the exact same features?
The answer: We buy on emotion and justify with logic. I
know that when I ﬁrst bought a Mercedes and my friends saw it,I told them that the reason I bought it was because of a series oftechnical features that I found very impressive. The real reason Ibought the car was not for the technical features at all. I wantedto own a prestigious car and belong to the crowd that drove aMercedes. But when I had to explain the reason for my purchase,I ended up using logic—something that I really believed was correct when I used it.
Mercedes Advertising
Look at a Mercedes ad. Since the Mercedes advertising agency
knows the real motivation behind the purchase of their cars, theyfocus on the reasons people use to justify their purchase. All theirads talk about the terriﬁc drive you get or the technical featuresthat make the car a breed apart. In reality, feature by feature, thereis nothing so revolutionary that it can’t be duplicated in a less ex-
66UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
======================================== [Página 91] ========================================

pensive car. The car is sold by virtue of its emotional appeal and
then justiﬁed in its advertising by an appeal to logic.
Look at the emotion of a message conveyed in the form of a
song. The music is like the vibration or that special harmony thatyou work at creating in an advertising message. If the music ap-peals to the audience and their soul, they are really set up to re-ceive the sales message—or in the case of a song, the words,which incidentally also have an attached emotion. A song is simi-lar to an advertisement.
Take a song and say the words without the music and it may
sound rather funny. Steve Allen back in the 1950s on The
Tonight Show would recite the words of a number one hit song
and get lots of laughs reciting, “Ooh pappa doo pappa doo pappawoo. I love you. Ooh pappa doo da ditty.” Without the music, thewords sounded absolutely ridiculous.
Logic Often Doesn’t Work
In writing copy for an advertisement, often you get your reader in
an emotional frame of mind as a result of the environment youhave created, and logic becomes less important. For example, I’vealways used the phrase near the end of my ads, “If you aren’t ab-solutely satisﬁed, return your product within 30 days for a prompt
and courteous refund. ” Who ever heard of a refund being courte-
ous? It doesn’t matter. The emotion or the feel of that phrase reallysays that we are a very respectful and understanding company thatwill return your money very promptly. With very few words, I con-veyed the feeling of being a concerned company that actspromptly. And even though the phrase makes no logical sense, ithas been picked up by several direct marketers and used in theircatalogs and print ads.
Often, a phrase or sentence or even a premise does not
have to be correct logically. As long as it conveys the messageemotionally, it not only does the job, but does it more effec-tively than the logical message.
A good example of this was an ad I wrote for a device that
had a breakthrough digital calculator display. The new displayshowed both alphabetical and numeric characters. And because ithad such a large memory, you could use it to hold the phone num-bers of your friends along with their names.
67COPY AS EMOTION
======================================== [Página 92] ========================================

At the time I had two competitors who got hold of the product
ﬁrst and came out with advertisements—both of which failed.There were several reasons they failed, but one of the main reasonswas the way they pitched the product—on a logical level. Theytried to explain what the term alphanumeric meant in a display and
how much memory the unit had. The ad was ﬁlled with facts andlogic, and because it was such a new breakthrough product youwould think it would sell just based on logic. It didn’t.
On a lark, I decided to sell a similar product myself in my
catalog. Canon Corporation had approached me and told me thatif I took their product, they would give me an exclusive for sev-eral months as long as I advertised it nationally.
I ﬁrst tested the ad in my catalog and came up with the
headline “Pocket Yellow Pages” with the subheadline being “Letyour ﬁngers do the data entry with America’s ﬁrst computerizedpocket telephone directory.” Now listen to the emotional versionof the copy.
You’re stuck. You’re at a phone booth trying to ﬁnd a phone
number, and people are waiting. You feel the pressure.
To the startled eyes of those around you, you pull out your calcu-
lator, press a few buttons, and presto—the phone number appearson the display of your calculator. A dream? Absolutely not.
The Emotional Approach
The ad was a terriﬁc success. We eventually placed the ad in
dozens of magazines and while the other competitors droppedout, we succeeded handsomely. But look at the emotional ap-proach I used. There is nothing about the product’s technical ad-vantages, nothing about the powerful memory of the unit. I justknew the nature of the product and the person buying this prod-uct. Each product has an inherent nature, and understanding thatinherent nature will help you sell it. (I explained this partiallywhen I talked about the Midex burglar alarm and the insurancesalesman in Chapter 2, “Speciﬁc Knowledge,” and will explainit in more detail later.) I realized that the product would appeal tothe gadget-motivated person who would want to show it off tohis or her friends. The ad copy reﬂects this speciﬁc knowledge.
Later on in the ad I justiﬁed the purchase with the facts and
68UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
======================================== [Página 93] ========================================

the technology but not too deeply. The real motivation for people to
buy this product was the emotional appeal of the sales message.
I was invited once to speak at New York University to a class
on direct marketing. As I addressed all the students on copywrit-ing, I told them that if I was handed a product, showed it to theclass and told the class to write an ad on the product, I wouldventure to say that everyone in the class would write a better adthan I would. I said, “Your grammar would be correct, yourspelling would be perfect and mine would be just horrible.”
What Comes after the First Draft Is What Counts
But it is what I do after that ﬁrst draft that makes my copy success-
ful compared to the rest of the class. I then went on to explain theediting process and its importance. But the reason, I explained, formy ad appearing so poorly written in my ﬁrst draft is because it issimply an emotional outpouring of my thoughts on the product andhow I feel it should be sold. It is a free release of my emotions.
And as you write copy, keep this in mind. It makes absolutely
no difference what your ﬁrst draft looks like. If you can get all yourfeelings and emotions about the subject out on paper and workfrom there, you will have mastered a very important technique.
The ﬁnal point on the emotion of copy relates to words
themselves. If you realize that each word has an emotion at-tached to it—almost like a short story unto itself—then you willalso have a very good understanding of what emotion means inthe copywriting process.
Look at a dictionary not as a collection of words but as a
collection of short stories. Webster once was quoted as sayingthat if you took every one of his possessions away and left himwith just his words, he’d get all his possessions back. The powerof words is enormous.
Words Have Strong Emotions Attached
What emotions do you feel when I mention the following words:
Cleveland, rip-off, consumer, farmer, lawyer, Soviet? Clevelandmay have evoked a little laughter as a place you might not con-sider moving to unless you live in Cleveland, and if you do livethere, please accept my apologies. Cleveland is a very nice city.But every country has a famous city that everybody makes fun
69COPY AS EMOTION
======================================== [Página 94] ========================================

of. The Russian comedian Yakov Smirnoff once said that in Rus-
sia they also have one city that the Russian comedians make funof. He says it too is Cleveland.
And then what do words like consumer and rip-off make you
feel? The word farmer may not only remind you of what a farmer
does for a living but also bring to mind words like honesty , in-
tegrity , earthy , hardworking . Think of all the feelings the word
farmer conjures up, not only from your experience but from what
you feel emotionally. The word Soviet sounds more sinister to me
than Russian . What thoughts come to mind with the word lawyer ?
When you analyze these words and see how you can use
them to create a message that has emotional impact, then youhave mastered an important lesson in writing copy.
Here’s some copy I wrote that points out the emotional
differences in copy. Which sounds better?
Example 1: The old woman in the motel.
Example 2: The little old lady in the cottage.
I was writing an ad on some rubbing oil I had discovered in
Hawaii and describing how I had discovered it. Example 1 wasin my ﬁrst draft but example 2 sounded much better.
I’m not suggesting that you materially change the facts of a
situation to suit an emotional feeling. In this case, the motel ofﬁcewas in a small cottage, and the word cottage gave the copy a better
emotional feel. What do you think? Do you “feel” the difference?
Sometimes changing a single word will increase response
in an ad. John Caples, the legendary direct marketer, changedthe word repair to the word ﬁxand saw a 20 percent increase in
response.
Don’t feel that you have to have a total command of the
emotional impact of words to be a great copywriter. It takes test-ing and common sense more than anything else. And knowingthe emotional feel of words is like your general knowledge—itcomes with time. It is enough for now that you realize the impor-tance of the emotional values in every word. As time goes on, you will feel this inﬂuence play a bigger and bigger role in yoursuccessful copywriting.
70UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
======================================== [Página 95] ========================================

Let’s discuss one of the most important and basic copywriting
principles I teach. In fact, if you can understand and learn thissingle point, you will have mastered a major lesson in writinggood advertising copy.
Never sell a product or service. Always sell a concept.
What do I mean by “concept”? There are many words that
mean the same thing. One day, for example, the hot buzzword inadvertising might be positioning . A product is positioned or
placed in such a way as to appeal to the consumer.
Other terms commonly used are Big Idea , or USP (unique
selling proposition), maybe even gimmick . Whatever it’s called,
it means basically the same thing. You sell the sizzle and not thesteak—the concept and not the product.
The only exception to this rule is when the product is so
unique or new that the product itself becomes the concept. Takethe digital watch for example. When the watches ﬁrst came out, Icould hardly keep them in stock. When I ﬁrst announced them,my main thrust was to explain the various features, which wereall new, and then just take orders.
But as the digital watches became plentiful and everybody
understood what they did and how they worked, each ad had todifferentiate the features of the watch through a unique concept.For example, the world’s thinnest digital watch or one with abuilt-in alarm or one with the most expensive band, or the onewith the ﬁnest quality, or even one that required a laser beam inits manufacturing process—all were different concepts. Con-cepts started selling watches; the product was no longer theconcept.
Another example is the Pocket CB. It had its concept right
there in the headline. There were walkie-talkies and there were
71Selling the Concept, Not the Product Chapter 12
Axiom 9
======================================== [Página 96] ========================================

mobile CB units, but we had the ﬁrst Pocket CB. And it was the
name itself that expressed the concept.
Or take the example of the Pocket Yellow Pages I referred
to in the previous chapter. Doesn’t that name express everythingyou really need to know about the product in a simple concept?In that ad I didn’t sell the product, but rather the concept ofstanding in a phone booth and pulling out an electronic directoryto the surprise and delight of those around you.
Another example was a smoke detector I was selling. In-
stead of selling it as a smoke detector, the headline screamed,“Nose”—a product that just sat on your ceiling and sniffed theair. It sold quite well.
Combining Products into Concepts
Sometimes the concept naturally comes from the product and
other times the concept can be created. I remember once runningseveral products in my catalog without much copy and discover-ing two that sold quite well. Rather than run them as separateproducts in full-page ads, I decided to run them together in onefull-page ad as a concept.
The two products were a miniature travel alarm and a chess
computer. But rather than develop a concept for each, I wrote theheadline “Winners” and told how both products were the top-selling products in our recent catalog. The headline put bothproducts under a single concept and made them both winnerswhile drawing attention to our catalog.
Sales continued briskly with the chess computer in 1978
when I received a call from the company in Hong Kong fromwhom we were importing the product. “Joe,” said my friend Pe-ter Auge, the man in Hong Kong supplying me with the com-puter, “I think I can get Anatoli Karpov, the Soviet chesschampion, to endorse our chess computer. I’m friends with himthrough a contact in Russia and it might make the chess com-puter sell better.”
Indeed it would, I thought, but let’s come up with a concept
using Karpov—not as a person who will endorse the product butas somebody whom we can challenge to play our unit. And in-
72UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
======================================== [Página 97] ========================================

deed, that’s what we did. Our ﬁrst major ad with Karpov’s name
appeared with the headline “Soviet Challenge.”
Subheadline: Can an American chess computer beat the Soviet
chess champion? A confrontation between American space-agetechnology and a Soviet psychological weapon.
Copy: The Soviet Union regards chess as a psychological
weapon, not just a game. It is a symbol of Communism’s culturalstruggle with the West.
So when Russian Anatoli Karpov competed against the Russian de-
fector Victor Korchnoi, he had the entire Soviet Union’s resourcesat his disposal, including a hypnotist and neuropsychologist.
Karpov won. And with it the world’s undisputed chess champi-
onship. Karpov, however, has never confronted American space-age technology and in particular JS&A’s new chess computer.
Of course the copy continued to talk about the challenge we
were making against Karpov. That was the concept. We weren’tselling chess computers. We were selling the challenge againstthe Russian champion and as a consequence selling chess com-puters. It was taking a very staid product and giving the entirepromotion a more emotional appeal.
Then the ad went on to explain how the unit worked, its
features and ended with the challenge to Karpov.
The ad had some pretty effective copy. And I’ve reproduced
it in Appendix E at the end of the book. Read it. It’s a lot of fun.
Soviet Intrigue
I was sitting in my ofﬁce as the ad was breaking throughout the
United States when I received an urgent telegram from overseas.Opening it up, I saw right away it was from Karpov. “I am goingto sue you for using me in your advertising without permission.”Signed: Anatoli Karpov.
I was told that I had permission to use his name by my
friend Peter, who said, in fact, that he would be sending me theendorsement contract and that I should go ahead and run the ad.So I did, thinking all was okay.
What to do? Simple. I could just see my next headline: “So-
viet Union Sues JS&A” or maybe “Little JS&A Attacked bySoviets.” What a great concept. But before I could sit down and
73SELLING THE CONCEPT, NOT THE PRODUCT
======================================== [Página 98] ========================================

write it, my friend Peter called and advised me that he had gotten
a copy of the telegram, too, and that everything had been workedout with Karpov’s agent and there was nothing to worry about.Karpov would endorse the chess computer and I could continuemy ad campaign.
I then sat down and wrote the third ad in the series, entitled
“Karpov Accepts,” which talked about the challenge made toKarpov and how he then decided that for whatever reason, hedidn’t want to play the chess computer as part of the challenge.Instead he could just endorse it and hope that many Americanswould learn to improve their chess game on it.
Concept Selling Does Well
All three ads did very well and more than 20,000 chess comput-
ers were sold. And all three had different concepts associatedwith them. Meanwhile, my competition was out there in forcetrying to sell their chess computers but not succeeding becausethey were selling chess computers and not Soviet Challengesand Karpov Accepts—concept advertising.
If your advertising just sells the product, be careful. You
need a concept. If you’ve come up with a unique concept, fantas-tic. You’ll do much better.
Price Can Also Affect Concept
Sometimes simply changing the price of a product can dramati-
cally alter its concept. For example, when we were offering ourPocket CB at $39.95 it came across as a serious electronic prod-uct similar to a full-sized CB radio. When we dropped the priceto $29.95 it became more of a sophisticated walkie-talkie. Andﬁnally when we dropped the price to $19.95, the product wasperceived as a toy—all this despite the fact that the copy in thead was pretty much the same.
Finding the concept is often not easy. It takes all the skills
of a conceptual thinker to come up with the right idea and theright position. One of my favorite advertisements that reallycaptured the essence of this chapter was an ad I once readfrom the Leo Burnett ad agency. It was a full-page ad that ap-peared in Advertising Age magazine and is reproduced on the
next page.
74UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
======================================== [Página 99] ========================================

It’s so true. Every product has that unique selling proposi-
tion that makes it stand out from the rest. And it is indeed up toyou, the copywriter, to realize this fact and discover each prod-uct’s uniqueness. If you do, the simple positioning of a productand the developing of a concept can be so powerful that it canmake the difference between a huge success and a loser. 
In the next chapter, you’ll discover how to come up with
that great idea as we study the incubation process.
75SELLING THE CONCEPT, NOT THE PRODUCT
Tcudorp
The ﬁrst job of an ad agency is to look at your
product in every imaginable way: frontwards, back-wards, sideways, upside down, inside out. Becausesomewhere, right there in the product itself, lies thedrama that will sell it to people who want it.
There may be 10,000 ways to bring that inher-
ent drama to the stage. And given a world in which“me-too” products multiply like mayﬂies, the dramamay seem that much harder to ﬁnd.
It is.But every good product has it.And every good agency ﬁnds it.

It’s ﬁne to read about the real secrets of copywriting, but let’s
get serious. One of these days you’re going to have to implementwhat you’ve learned and start writing copy. What are some ofthe mental steps required to write copy in general and how doyou go about writing effective copy?
Let’s establish a few things that you have learned already in
this book and then take everything a step further. As you recall, Ireferred to general knowledge—the knowledge youhave picked up simply by living—and speciﬁc knowl-edge—the knowledge you acquired while studyingthe speciﬁc product you want to write copy about.
Assume you are now an expert on a particular
product and you are ready to start writing. The ﬁrstthing I would do is go over all the material you haveon your subject and give a great deal of thought towhat you have just read and studied. Do plenty ofthinking about what you want to write. You may jotdown some headlines and some of the copy pointsyou would like to bring out. You might list thosepoints that best describe the nature of the productyou are selling and you might like to list some of thestrong reasons that your product would appeal toyour customers. Put all your thoughts down on paper. But keepin mind, you have not yet started to write the copy. This is justpreparation.
Or don’t put a thing on paper and just think through
everything you know about the challenge you have to solvethrough copy.
You might even visualize the end result of your work.
Maybe it’s imagining that a stack of mail has arrived showingwhat a great response you received. Maybe it’s your boss com-ing up to you and patting you on the back for a job well done.
77The Incubation Process Chapter 13
Take a break
from your
work and
do something
pleasurable
while your
brain
incubates.
======================================== [Página 102] ========================================

Once you’ve done all that, do something that may seem strange
to you at ﬁrst. Stop.
That’s right, stop. Do something else. Forget about the pro-
ject. Do something pleasurable—a stroll in the park, a walkdown the street or lunch with a good friend. Whatever you do,let it be a total diversion from what you are currently workingon, and please don’t even think of the copy project.
Whether you realize it or not, you are actually working on
the ad constantly even though you’ve put it out of your mind.Your subconscious mind is actually processing everythingyou’ve learned—all of that data that you have accumulated ingeneral and all of the information in particular. And your mind isthen taking all of that data and running it through everything youknow about copywriting and communications, mentally prepar-ing the ﬁrst version of your ad copy. 
It is taking this information and working through the millions
of permutations possible to come up with the best solution to yourmarketing problem. And you’re doing absolutely nothing about it.You’re just out having a good time while your brain is working likecrazy. And ironically, if you start thinking about your project again,you interrupt this process and the results won’t be as good. This en-tire subconscious activity is called the incubation process, and thetime you are giving to it is called the incubation period.
Your subconscious is processing millions of bits of data like
a computer in your brain running a very important program in thebackground. Then, while you’re taking a walk or standing in ashower or even daydreaming, suddenly that big idea will ﬂashacross your mind. Eureka! Then go to your desk and start writingdown some of that good stuff your subconscious mind has createdand organized for you.
Your Mind Is Always Working
Sure, you might think you can eliminate the incubation period.
You never do. Even when the pressure of deadlines prevents mefrom taking the luxury of time to incubate, I’m still incubatingbut at a much more rapid speed. The results may not be as good,however. The time pressure only increases the incubation processand speeds up the assimilation of data in your brain. If you have
78UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
======================================== [Página 103] ========================================

the luxury, your copywriting and what you produce will improve
if you balance the pressure of deadlines with time away from theproject. This could also mean working on one project, then goingto another and subsequently coming back to the ﬁrst one. This isanother way of allowing you the luxury of having your subcon-scious mind work on a project while you do something else.
The incubation process actually works best with pressure of
some kind. If you have no pressure, your brain will not work asfast or as efﬁciently. So it is a balance of various pressures thatproduces the optimum results.
What causes pressure? We already know that time causes
pressure but there are other factors as well. Ego for example. Ifyou have a big ego, it creates a certain amount of pressure. Thispressure can be very positive in the incubation process. For ex-ample, your boss expects you to produce some knockout copyand your ego won’t let you disappoint her. You’ve added to theincubation pressure. Your creative orientation plays a role, too.For example, if you are naturally creative, you have a big advan-tage over someone who is not. And ﬁnally, the environmentplays a role. If you are in a creative environment that encouragesthose incubation activities required in the creative process, it willhelp the incubation process along.
Just Allow It to Happen
Now don’t show this chapter to your boss and say, “See, Joe Sugar-
man tells me to take a pleasurable walk in the park on companytime and enjoy myself while my brain incubates.” That’s nonsenseand not the purpose of this chapter. In this chapter, I just want youto realize that there is a constant process going on in the back-ground of your brain. And with the proper balance, you can createblockbuster copy by allowing the incubation process to function.
The biggest mistake a manager can make in a mail order
company is to have the creative department in the same buildingas any other department in the company. Imagine the operationspeople walking in to see the creative people incubating—staringinto space or taking a long break with one of their peers. “Thoseprivileged bastards in creative really get away with murder”would be a typical comment. But the creative department needsthat atmosphere in order to function to its optimum.
79THE INCUBATION PROCESS
======================================== [Página 104] ========================================

If management imposed the same rules on the creative
department as on the rest of the staff who have to function ona conscious level during their jobs, the end result would be a
sure drop in good creative work. It’s important to keep the cre-ative staff separate from the rest of a company because the copy-writer needs a little more freedom to incubate and create.
When it comes time to sit down and knock out that copy,
discipline comes into play. You’ve got to let that copy come pour-ing out of your brain, forgetting about spelling and grammar. Re-member, your mind takes the data you’ve accumulated and runs itthrough everything you know about copywriting, communica-tions and life in general. Well, hold back the stuff on spelling andgrammar just long enough to let the copy ﬂow out freely.
Left Brain versus Right Brain
If you’re knowledgeable about writing and creative thinking, you
know that there has been much said about the different hemi-spheres of our brains controlling different types of thinking. Theright brain does the intuitive or emotional thinking and the leftbrain does the logical. Which side of the brain should write thecopy? The right brain of course. Let the copy ﬂow out of that rightbrain and let it pour out unencumbered by any left-brain restraints.
The pouring out of that copy or idea is the culmination of
the incubation process. It is the end result of all the mental activ-ity that has been running in the background. And so, the axiomthat I suggest you remember is:
The incubation process is the power of your subconscious mind
to use all your knowledge and experiences to solve a speciﬁcproblem, and its efﬁciency is dictated by time, creative orienta-tion, environment and ego. 
If you’ve gone through the incubation process and then put
your thoughts on paper, you’ve accomplished half the challengeof writing good copy. (Next comes the fun part—the editingprocess. We’ll have to wait for that process in later chapters ofthis book.) Now that you are mentally prepared to tackle thecopywriting process, it’s time to decide how much copy youshould actually write.
80UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
Axiom 10
======================================== [Página 105] ========================================

Incubate, slippery slide, seeds of curiosity—all may be neat
concepts, but often at my seminars the question would come up:Do people read all the copy in your ads? Students of direct mar-keting learn that there is no such thing as copy that is too long.And there is some truth to this.
The key is simply this: Copy is never too long if the reader
takes the action you request. Therefore, it can’t be dull, it mustbe compelling, it must relate to the reader and, ﬁnally, it’s got tobe about something the reader is interested in.
What we’re talking about here is the slippery slide concept.
The copy must be so compelling that it will be read from the be-ginning to the end. Everything else is secondary. If you don’twrite compelling copy, you’ll never get the reader to read thepart of the copy that sells your product.
Will people read long copy? Let me answer the question in
a different way by having you go through a little experiment. Onthe following lines I want you to ﬁll in the blanks for an articleas I direct you.
Headline: _______________ (Your Last Name) Family Chosen
as Heirs of Multimillion-Dollar Fortune
Subheadline: Family who lives on ____________ (Your Street)
in ___________ _ (Your City) was willed millions of dollars by
an anonymous person.
If you saw that headline and subheadline in your local
newspaper, would you read the ﬁrst sentence? Of course youwould. Let’s say the copy read as follows:
Wow, what a score! How would you like to inherit millions of
dollars from somebody you don’t even know?
Well, that’s what happened to __________ (Your Full Name), who
has yet to be found but who might have fallen into one of the great-est fortunes ever received from somebody who remains unknown.
81How Much Copy Should You Write? Chapter 14
======================================== [Página 106] ========================================

Of course you would read the entire 3,000-word article. Af-
ter all, the article is talking about you. You are involved, you re-late to what is being written in a very intense way and it’s bothinformative and interesting, to you in particular.
And that’s my point about long copy. If the copy does all
the things I’ve just described, the reader will be intensely inter-ested in it and will read it all—maybe not with the intensity ofsomebody who just won millions of dollars, but with an intensitythat could come very close if your copy is effective.
Intense Interest
I’m writing this book on a Macintosh computer. A short time ago
while I was mastering my word processing program and had anintense interest in this computer, I would read anything on theMacintosh. And I would read an entire article or advertisement ifit was on the subject I was interested in. Later, after I masteredwhat I had to learn, the information was not as interesting to meand I did not seek it out with the same intensity.
This is also true about products.
When digital watches ﬁrst appeared, mycustomers were very intense about buy-ing them. And they bought them indroves. They read every word of mycopy. It was informative and helpful, itinvolved them and they read the ads withinterest. When the market for digitalwatches deteriorated and the fad was
over, my customers were not as intense about the product categoryand went on to other things. Therefore readership dropped.
Copy will be read if it is interesting to the reader. I can re-
member when I would visit the car showrooms in the 1950slooking at new cars with their huge tail ﬁns and sleek new de-signs. Ads would talk about rack and pinion steering and I of-ten wondered what that meant. All that the copy would do isgo into the feel of driving the car, which is good emotionalcopy but didn’t really tell me enough. And when somethingdoesn’t tell you enough, it will cause you to go to the show-room and ask questions, which is maybe what the car compa-nies want you to do.
82UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
If the copy is
interesting,the reader willread it all.
======================================== [Página 107] ========================================

But often the salesmen didn’t know much, either. Rack and
pinion steering was foreign even to them.
I learned a lesson from those visits to car showrooms. You
can’t tell the prospect enough about a subject he or she is trulyinterested in. And so it is with copywriting. People will read witha high degree of intensity if you are talking about somethingthey are genuinely or passionately interested in.
Long Enough but Short Enough
Back in the days when copywriters were mostly men, there was
an old adage about copy length: “Copy is like a woman’s skirt. Itshould be long enough to cover the essentials but short enoughto make it interesting.”
Let’s use the same example of the salesperson visiting a
prospect that we used earlier in this book on page 35. But this time,the salesperson appears for the appointment and the prospect ex-plains that he can’t meet for 45 minutes because he is in the middleof a budget session. Could the salesperson make the presentation in15 minutes? What would you do?
A good salesperson would make a new appointment. If the
sales presentation takes an hour, then it should be an hour long—not more and not 15 minutes. And so it is with copy. Depending onhow long your sales pitch is, the copy should cover the amount oftime you need to create the selling environment, develop interest inthe product, relate to the prospect’s needs and make the sale.
The copy has to be long enough to tell the entire story or make
the entire sales pitch—no longer and no shorter. Of course there arecertain practical limits, but even these can be broken. When GaryHalbert, one of the great mail order copywriters, was looking for agirlfriend, he ran a full-page 3,000-word personal ad in a local LosAngeles newspaper. He was deluged with potential dates.
And when Richard DelGaudio wanted a personal assistant
to help him run his fund-raising company, he ran a 4,000-wordwant ad that pulled in more qualiﬁed respondents than he wasable to interview.
The Long-Copy Approach
There really is no limit to how long copy should be if you get re-
sults. For example, if a good salesperson made his or her pitch in
83HOW MUCH COPY SHOULD YOU WRITE?
======================================== [Página 108] ========================================

10 minutes and sold a prospect on purchasing a $19.95 house-
hold gadget and another salesperson selling a million-dollarhigh-speed printing press took several months to consummate a sale, then who would be the better salesperson? There is, ofcourse, no answer. Both could be great or both could be lousy.Why then should there be such controversy over copy length? If,as I hope you believe by now, selling in print is very similar toselling in person, then shouldn’t the same rules apply?
So let’s take a moment and look at two factors that increase
the need for a lot of copy.
Price Point: The higher the price point, the more copy re-
quired to justify the price or create the need. This is a generalrule unless the price point is perceived to be a tremendous value(then less copy may be required) or the lower price point appearsto lack credibility (then more copy is required). More copy willallow you to increase the value of a product and add many moredollars to your retail price. In short, by educating the consumeryou can demand more money for your product.
Unusual Item: The more unusual the product, the more
you need to relate that product to the user and the more you’vegot to focus on creating the buying environment and explainingthe product’s new features. At retail, generally, this type of itemwill not sell. Mail order is the perfect method to use when youhave the right amount of copy.
In conclusion, there are two basic reasons for using the
long-copy approach. The ﬁrst is to allow you to create an envi-ronment that will place your prospect in the proper buyingmood, and the second is to give you the time necessary to tell thefull story of your product.
Short Copy Works, Too
Robert Scott of Scottcade Ltd., an English mail order company,
came to my seminar and told me that his approach broke all ofmy rules. His catalog copy was very short, yet he still sold a lotof merchandise.
But his catalog really appeared to follow my rules. First, he
created his environment through photography. The productswere placed in elegant settings using ﬁne photography. Second,
84UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
======================================== [Página 109] ========================================

his prices were very low compared to those of other companies or
retailers. Since he was offering his products at such low prices andsince his environment was so effective in placing the customer ina buying mood, a lot of what normally would have been done incopy was being done visually and through the price points of hisproducts. Then too, his medium was a catalog, and in catalogslong copy is often not required. The catalog creates the environ-ment, thus saving you the time of creating it with copy.
I am not trying to sell you on using long copy. I use short
copy at times and sometimes very short copy indeed. But theshort copy I use is usually all that is required and the price pointsare low enough that the short copy does the job. In fact, I am notfor long or short. I’m for causing the prospect to exchange his or her hard-earned money for your product or service, and quitefrankly, copy length has always been just one of several consider-ations in producing an advertisement.
So the axiom to remember from this chapter is simply:
Copy should be long enough to cause the reader to take the ac-
tion you request.
Do people read all that copy? Some do. And there are
enough of them who do to have earned me and several othercopywriters a nice living.
85HOW MUCH COPY SHOULD YOU WRITE?
Axiom 11
======================================== [Página 110] ========================================


======================================== [Página 111] ========================================

If you have read the chapters of this book in sequence, you are
building a good foundation to understand and learn copywriting.
This chapter builds upon the knowledge that took me sev-
eral years of copywriting to really understand and learn. Learn-ing it wasn’t difﬁcult, but understanding why it was so importanttook a little longer.
One of the things that ads should do is harmonize with the
reader or viewer. Advertising is the ultimate form of communi-cation in that its purpose is to cause an action to be taken by con-sumers—usually to exchange their hard-earned money for aproduct or service. But for some reason, many advertisers aremissing an important key in this form of communication—namely, it should be personal.
As a good example of personal communications, let’s ﬁrst
cover direct mail. In direct mail, personal communi-cation is easy to understand. After all, you are writinga letter to a single individual.
But in creating the letter that goes with a mailing,
too many copywriters write their letters as if they werehiding behind a podium, speaking through a micro-phone and addressing a large audience. For example:
We at ABC Company wish to invite all of you to visit
our exhibit again at the upcoming trade show. Ourstaff will be there to meet you and demonstrate ournew and novel button machine.
The personal way of saying it might be:
Hi. You might remember me from the last trade show. Well, I’dlike to invite you to the next one where I will be looking forwardto meeting you again to demonstrate our new and novel buttonmachine.
You see the difference? The second version is more per-
sonal and direct. It is me talking to you—not me talking to a

ment should be a
personal message
from the adver-
tiser to the
prospect.
======================================== [Página 112] ========================================

large crowd. It is as if I, as an individual, were writing that letter
to another individual.
Now, in direct mail this makes sense. Why not make your
letters more personal and direct—more like one person talkingto another in a direct and eyeball-to-eyeball sort of folksy way?Of course, folksy might not be the best way in certain circum-stances. That’s okay. As long as you use words like I, youand
me, you create the feel of a personal form of communication.
Emotional Process in Communication
Remember I said earlier that copywriting is an emotional out-
pouring of an idea onto paper. And I said that copywriting is verymuch an emotional process. Look at the following two lettersfrom the same company and see how much more emotional onesounds than the other.
Dear Customer: We here at Consolidated International would
like to thank you for your recent order. We realize that you couldhave given your business to many of the other companies in ourindustry, but the fact that you chose Consolidated International isreally appreciated by our entire staff. Thank you very much. Sin-cerely, Mr. John Smith.
Now compare it to the following:
Dear Mr. Jones: I just wanted to thank you personally for your re-cent order, which I’ve just received. I took your order and evenshowed it to the president of our company. I realize that you hada number of other choices, but I really appreciate the fact thatyou chose my company. Sincerely, John Lee.
Both letters would have served the same purpose. But the
second letter was warmer, more personal and you felt that Mr.Lee was talking to you directly. Indeed, he was happy to get yourorder—so happy that he went to his president and showed it tohim. It was a genuine expression of thanks and a direct mes-sage—all with genuine emotion.
On the other hand, the letter from Mr. Smith could have
been a form letter that the company sends to all its customers,thereby losing the personal feeling that Mr. Lee’s letter had. Itlacked the warmth and personal touch. The difference should beobvious. Read both letters again, and this time feel the differ-ence. Put yourself in the place of Mr. Jones and imagine how hewould have felt if he had received both letters.

Letters Should Be Personal
Good examples of a personal letter were the letters I used to
send out to a membership program in my Consumers Hero club.They may have been totally off the wall, but they served mypurposes well.
The membership program was created in response to our
advertisement for our discount club in which we refurbishednew but defective products and then sold them, at discountprices, through a club we established.
Part of the club program was our regular monthly bulletin.
It listed all the buys for that month, and along with it came avery folksy letter talking about the club.
The image I conveyed was not that of a very large, imper-
sonal corporation ﬁlling the needs of its membership but that of a bunch of hardworking people, of all ethnic backgrounds,working together in harmony to make the company a success.
The company had to be portrayed as being small. That was
essential for the concept. After all, that was part of the image—alittle consumer-oriented company ﬁghting the big U.S. corpora-tions and the effects of inﬂation.
And one of the techniques we used to keep the image of a
small company was to use old envelopes from companies thathad gone out of business. We simply explained that the en-velopes were no longer good and it was our way of savingmoney as well as the environment and passing the savings on tothe consumer.
So in one month, members might get an envelope from Ski
Lift International, a defunct company, and the next month theymight get a letter from CMT Machine Tool Company, anotherdefunct company, but the contents of the envelope were alwaysfrom Consumers Hero.
As membership cards, we sent out Batman credit cards.
(There is a whole story on that card, but that’s for some otherbook I plan to write.) And one of the qualities we tried to conveywas absolute total honesty. We were so honest that the readerwould actually be embarrassed for us. The typical letter is on thefollowing page.
89THE ART OF PERSONAL COMMUNICATION
======================================== [Página 114] ========================================

Even though the letters were from the staff as opposed to an
individual, they still conveyed a personal feel to the reader. Andweren’t they fun to read? We often got comments that the lettersalone were worth the price of the membership.
In print ads, the need to be personal becomes less apparent.
After all, you are talking to the masses, aren’t you? But the factremains that you are indeed talking to a single individual—that

The very down-to-
earth and personalletter sent toConsumers Heromembers.
======================================== [Página 115] ========================================

person reading your ad. And he or she is listening to a single in-
dividual—the person who wrote the ad. So it is essential that youwrite your copy as if you are writing to that single individual.Your copy should be very personal. From me to you. Period.
Use of a Byline
An effective way to do this in print is to use a byline. Use your
name or the name of somebody in your organization such as thepresident—like the news organizations do in a magazine ornewspaper article. This allows you to use words like Iand me
and weand you. Let’s look at the example of the ad I ﬁrst ran for
BluBlocker sunglasses that launched a multimillion-dollar com-pany.
Headline: Vision Breakthrough
Subheadline: When I put on the pair of glasses what I saw I
could not believe. Nor will you.
Byline: By Joseph Sugarman
Copy: I am about to tell you a true story. If you believe me, you
will be well rewarded. If you don’t believe me, I will make itworth your while to change your mind. Let me explain.
Read that personal copy. It’s as if I were talking to that per-
son directly. I used the words Iand youand me—all very per-
sonal words used in a one-to-one conversation. Let’s examinethe ﬁrst paragraph of copy from a few other ads that were writtenin this personal tone.
This may surprise you. In fact, if my hunches are correct simply
reading this article may change your idea of aging for the rest ofyour life. Here’s why.
Or how about the following:
If I were to buy a ticket in the Illinois State Lottery, my chances ofwinning would be a million to one. But if I were to bet that you, asa reader of this publication, have high blood pressure and don’teven know it, my chances of being correct would be eight to one.
The above paragraphs show how very personal you can get
in copy and still convey a very powerful thought or develop theenvironment and slippery slide you need to cause your reader tocontinue reading and then respond.
91THE ART OF PERSONAL COMMUNICATION
======================================== [Página 116] ========================================

When I started writing, I kept a low proﬁle and never used
my name in any advertising communications. But as I becamemore proﬁcient and saw the effect a personal message could cre-ate in direct mail, I started using my byline in print on a regularbasis. In my catalog, I could speak in the ﬁrst person about allthe products because on the ﬁrst page of the catalog I introducedmyself in a letter to my customers.
Even Magazines Have Personalities
I remember reading a story about the image conveyed by 
the magazine itself. Forbes magazine has a strong personality.
Steve Forbes now runs the publication and his editorials appearin every issue. A reader feels more personally involved with thepublication. In contrast, BusinessWeek appears more like a cor-
porate publication even though it has many bylines. A business-woman once commented that she could put her arms aroundForbes and hug the magazine but would only feel comfortable
shaking BusinessWeek ’s hand. So it is with copywriting.
You want to create a very personal image so that people
will emotionally respond to you, feel close and feel very com-fortable parting with their hard-earned money and buying yourproduct or service.
Every communication should be a personal one, from the
writer to the recipient, regardless of the medium used.
So as you start to write copy to reach and motivate an indi-
vidual, think in terms of writing in the ﬁrst person with a per-sonal message.
You are now ready to write that ﬁrst ad. Everything you’ve
read has prepared you for this moment, and everything that youare going to learn later in this book will only polish what you al-ready know. True, you’re also going to get a whole bunch of newinsights, too. But right now you’re ready for the big plunge. Inthe next chapter, we discuss writing your ﬁrst ad using my tech-niques and thought processes.
92UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
Axiom 12
======================================== [Página 117] ========================================

You are now really ready to write that ﬁrst successful ad. You 
already know how important it is to know your subject. You al-ready know the purpose of all the elements in an advertise-ment—to get the prospect to read the ﬁrst sentence. And youknow all the axioms to get the reader to read beyond the ﬁrstsentence and all the way to your last word.
Copy must also ﬂow. And its ﬂow must make sense. It must
be in an understandable order where each thought ﬂows logi-cally to the next.
Many people have told me that when a question comes into
their minds as they read my ads, I answer it in the next sentence.They often claim that it’s almost uncanny. But that’s the skill thatmakes the good direct response copywriter the envy of any one-on-one salesperson.
Leading the Reader
Since we copywriters do not have the beneﬁt of having the
prospect in front of us to ask the questions, we must craft our adsin such a manner that they literally lead our prospect (by the ﬂowof the copy) to ask the question we want to answer. Sounds hard,doesn’t it? It really isn’t.
Start by writing the headline. Will it grab the reader? Then
write the subheadline. Will it compel the reader to read further?Then write the caption to go under an imaginary picture. Is allthis strong enough to get people to read the ﬁrst sentence? Andthen write the ﬁrst sentence.
Once you start using my thought process, you’ll ﬁnd a dis-
cipline and a direction that you might not have experienced inwriting copy before.
You might even write a paragraph in the copy to stand out
in boldface type similar to the Consumers Hero ad that reads:

IMPOSSIBLE-TO-TRACE GUARANTEE
We guarantee that our stolen products will look like brand
new merchandise without any trace of previous brand identi-ﬁcation or ownership.
At my seminar, I would call on various students and ask them
to read their headlines. The class would then critique each headlineto determine if it would get us all to read the subheadline. It was agood process with 20 students from all walks of life coming upwith some of the most creative approaches on a variety of subjects.
One day, my eight-year-old daughter April was sitting in
one of the chairs in the class. She was taking notes, listening in-tently and, in short, acting exactly like one of the students. Iwould always allow my children free access to the entire semi-nar process and they had never been a nuisance. In fact, the stu-dents liked this family touch.
April Becomes a Real Nuisance
After I had assigned an ad-writing exercise and asked for volun-
teers to read their ads, April started waving her hand wildly. Icalled on a man from New Zealand—Archie Mason—who was inthe wool business. Later, when I asked for another volunteer, April once again waved her hand wildly but I called on anotherstudent—Fred Simon, president of Omaha Steaks. Finally, Aprilcame up to me in front of the class and whispered, “Dad, let meread my ad. It’s a good one. It follows your principles.”
I was annoyed. “Later, April. Can’t you see I’m trying to
teach the class?”
Finally, at break time, April came up to me and handed me
her ad. I read it. It indeed was a good example of anticipatingwhat a consumer would ask and then answering it. It was verysimple—after all, an eight-year-old had written it—but it con-tained a question-and-answer format that was very logical andcovered a topic of interest that her eight-year-old peers wouldenjoy reading. Her product was a guinea pig. The ad read:
Headline: The Best Pet
Subheadline: Do you want a pet that doesn’t shed?
Copy: Think about it. You can get a pet that doesn’t shed, doesn’t
run around the house, and is easy to take care of.
94UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
======================================== [Página 119] ========================================

You have probably guessed it’s a rabbit, bird, ﬁsh or a turtle.
Well, you’re wrong. It’s a guinea pig.
You probably want to know how do you take care of the guinea
pig? Where should I keep it? What does it eat?
It’s all simple. If you don’t have a guinea pig cage, then get a box
high enough so it won’t get out and large enough so it can runaround. 
Feed it guinea pig pellets and feed it a couple fresh greens. Put
plastic at the bottom and newspaper on top then at least an inchhigh of shavings. Put a bowl in for food and a water bottle forwater.
That’s all you need to know. To order, call [phone number] and
order today.
April’s ad made an important point, which I have reminded
each class of since. Good copy can be written at any age and byanybody. Simply understanding the principles and applyingthem to something you intuitively know is all it takes.
Logical Progression of Flowchart
In class I would ask my students to write a headline and a sub-
headline. I would then ask for the ﬁrst sentence, then the nextsentence and then the next until each student had composed acomplete ad. 
The ads had to ﬂow on paper and then, once they were on
paper, the editing process was of paramount importance. One ofthe tips I gave during this process was to create a block diagramof a logical way the copy should ﬂow and the questions thatmight logically be asked.
In order to develop a sense for this, you break your ad into
small abbreviated copy blocks similar to those in a corporateﬂowchart. But this ﬂowchart goes in one direction only—down.
I made a block diagram of the ad I did for an electronic pin-
ball game from Bally manufacturing. I showed that at the start ofthe ad, I wanted to get my reader into the copy and then I wantedto set the environment for the product. So, I started the ad with thefun times that this product represented. The ad started like this:
It’s you against a computer. And the action and excitement from
Fireball, your own computerized pinball machine, is nothingshort of spectacular.
95THE COPY SEQUENCE
======================================== [Página 120] ========================================

Fireball’s computer replaces many of the mechanical, scoring,
conventional electronics and sensing devices of a standard pin-ball machine. It’s a dramatic change in pinball devices and thestart of a new consumer electronics revolution.
With the ﬁrst paragraph I create interest and excitement
for this product. With the second paragraph I start to weave thedrama of the product and the differences between Fireball and
conventional pinball games.
Then I go into the next block of copy and explain why and
how the game is different, how to play it and some of the unique
features made possible by the computerized electronics.
Logically, a reader who had read this far would want to
know a little more about how the game was constructed, thequality of the product and the many new features. Therefore, thenext block of copy has this information.
Okay, you are really interested in purchasing this game. But
you say to yourself, “How can I justify it? I’d love to get thisFireball game. Emotionally I’m hooked, but how can I justifypurchasing it?” 
So the next block should justify the purchase. I used cost
comparisons with what you pay for a TV set, pool table or yourstereo system. I plant the seed about its practicality when guestspop in and how Fireball will be the hit of any party or familygathering. It’s here that I’m giving the prospects the logic theyneed to make that emotional purchase. I even suggest that a busi-ness might purchase one as a way to entertain employees at workand claim it as an investment tax credit and depreciation ex-pense—all tax-saving measures. I knew I had to provide all thelogic possible for this $650 purchase.
By now the customer is saying to himself, “Okay, I want to
get the unit and I can justify the purchase, but what if I use it, gettired of it and it sits in the corner like that exercise device that’sgathering dust?”
So I go into the fact that it has lasting play value. And I de-
scribe several reasons why people won’t get tired of it.
The customer is now thinking to himself, “Hmm. I like the
product, I can justify it and I can see that it will have lasting play

The ﬂowchart for

======================================== [Página 121] ========================================

value, but what if I buy this big pinball game and suddenly the
computer poops out?” I then raise the service question in the ad
copy and answer it. The point of each of these blocks of copy isthat they are logically placed as if to anticipate the next questiona prospect is going to ask—all in an environment that you havecreated and all ﬂowing logically to the last part of the ad whenyou ask for the order.
Flowing in a Logical Sequence
When you work with copy long enough, the ﬂow is automatic. You
don’t need to do ﬂowcharts, as you can instinctively sense the nextquestion and answer it. And that is the special skill that a good di-rect response copywriter has over a one-on-one salesperson. Wesense the questions, answer them—and we do it on a mass scale.
You still might ﬁnd it helpful to create a block diagram of
your ad after you’ve written it to see if it ﬂows properly andraises the right question at the right time. How do you want tosequence your questions in your copy? What kind of environ-ment do you want to weave through the early part of the text?What are some of the questions you would surely be asked aboutthe product if you were a salesperson and you were selling theproduct face-to-face?
It’s really all common sense. Looking at your copy as it ﬂows
out onto a computer screen or onto a piece of paper is the mechan-ical part of this process but not the important part. It’s the commonsense you use to anticipate the sequence of what will be askednext and how your copy should ﬂow that really counts at this stageof the copywriting process. This brings up my next axiom.
The ideas presented in your copy should ﬂow in a logical fash-
ion, anticipating your prospect’s questions and answeringthem as if the questions were asked face-to-face.
By now you understand the basic concepts of good direct-
marketing copywriting. You understand the importance of be-coming an expert on the product you are going to write about.You know that the more you learn about a product or service, thegreater the chances you’ll come up with that unique copy angleor product position or big idea.
97THE COPY SEQUENCE
Axiom 13
======================================== [Página 122] ========================================

But there are some other tips I can give you that will help
generate that concept you want to develop. First, state the prob-lem. It might be as simple as “I want to sell this pinball game.”Then, once you have stated the problem, restate it in a differentway: “I would like to introduce my prospect to the unique as-pects of this pinball game.” Then restate it again: “I want tomake the pinball machine easy to buy and seem like fun.”
It’s that last restatement that makes the pinball game seem
to come alive and is closer to the copy approach I’ve actuallyused. During problem restatements (and you could list dozens ofthem), all the knowledge that you’ve gained about the productseems to come together to give a new perspective.
Prepare That Big Idea
Once you’ve restated your problem and you have the statement
that you like best, sit down and list your big ideas or concepts.List several concepts. Then pick the one or two that make themost sense.
Visualize your concept and see how it might be incorpo-
rated into the ad. Think again about your problem restatementand whether your concept seems to be consistent with it. Thenstop. It’s time to incubate.
After you’ve slept on it for a while, start writing. First write
your headline—an attention-getting blockbuster of a headline shortenough to grab the reader’s attention. Then write the subheadline—so compelling and curiosity-building that your prospect must readthe ﬁrst sentence. And ﬁnally, write the ﬁrst sentence of thecopy—short, to the point and strong enough to carry you into thenext sentence—and then it’s down the slippery slide.
Block-diagram your ad. What do the ﬁrst few paragraphs
do for the ad? What is the emotional appeal? Are you anticipat-ing those questions and answering them to the satisfaction ofyour prospect? Are you frank and honest in those answers?
Try Patterning Your Ad
Another approach is called “patterning.” Simply pick an ad writ-
ten by somebody you admire and whose product or service issimilar to yours and use their ad as a pattern or style from whichto write. If they use a long headline, make your headline long. If
98UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
======================================== [Página 123] ========================================

they use a lot of captions, then you create a number of captions.
Capture the feel of the ad, but be careful. Do not copy the per-son’s layout too closely so that people reading the ad might thinkat ﬁrst glance it was from the company you were copying. Thisexercise is only to give you a format or guide from which towrite. If you copy the layout too closely, you are violating therights of the person who wrote the ad.
The main points in this chapter are the basic steps and the
thought processes you go through as you construct your ad. Thekey point is that you don’t have the prospect in front of you, so you have to anticipate the questions the prospect will ask inalmost the same order the prospect will ask them.
This ﬂow is important. But there is also a critical part of the
copywriting process that really separates the best copywritersfrom the rest. It’s called the editing process and we cover it in thenext chapter.
99THE COPY SEQUENCE
======================================== [Página 124] ========================================


======================================== [Página 125] ========================================

This chapter holds one of the most valuable secrets to effective
and persuasive copy, for it is in the editing process that you turnthat raw emotional outpouring of thoughts and ideas into a pol-ished, harmonious, resonant tuning fork that will vibrate per-fectly with your prospect.
It’s like the story of a diamond. When a diamond is found it
looks like a piece of coal or carbon. Take that black, ugly stone andpolish it and it soon becomes the world’s most beautiful gemstone.
Remember that lecture I referred to earlier in Chapter 11
that I gave at New York University? I mentioned to the studentsthat if everybody in the class completed a writing assignment,my ﬁrst draft would probably be the worst in the class. Poorgrammar, atrocious spelling and disjointed sentence structuremight be the way an English teacher would describe it.
But it is what I do after that ﬁrst draft that makes the differ-
ence. It’s the difference between just plain copy and a polishedadvertising message—from copy that doesn’t move prospects tocopy that moves prospects so strongly that they reach into theircollective pockets and exchange their hard-earned money foryour product or service. It’s the difference between earning asalary as a copywriter and earning millions of dollars as an effec-tive copywriter/entrepreneur.
The Secret to Editing
Is there a secret to editing? Once again, it is a mental process that
almost parallels that of the copywriting act itself. It requires lotsof practice, although you will ﬁnd it easier to do than writing thecopy itself. In fact, it is a lot more fun. Look at the act of writingthe ﬁrst draft as giving birth. It may be a painful, long process orit can go quite quickly with little pain. Then compare the editingprocess to raising the child—the caring and nurturing required toensure a healthy, happy child.
101The Editing Process Chapter 17
======================================== [Página 126] ========================================

You wouldn’t want your child to go out into the world in
funny clothes, unable to communicate or relate with others,would you? You therefore have to mold and nurture that child asyou prepare to present him or her to the rest of the world.
Editing is a nurturing process. And just as there is no perfect
way to nurture your child, there are many different approaches toediting copy that are certainly acceptable. I strive for one resultwhen I edit, and this can be summed up in the following axiom:
In the editing process, you reﬁne your copy to express exactly
what you want to express with the fewest words.
Now this sounds rather simple, doesn’t it? But it is the true
essence of the editing process. You want to maintain the sameemotional feel, the same thought process, the same vibration thatyou had in mind when you wrote the copy. It’s just that you wantto do it in the fewest words.
This may mean that you rearrange the words you wrote to
make the thought more direct. Or it may mean cutting out wordsthat have little contribution to the overall feel of the ad. It maymean substituting new words that express your thoughts better.And it may even mean adding words to clarify a thought. But thegoal in writing ad copy is to express the thoughts you want toconvey in the most powerful way but with the fewest words.
I remember the feeling I had writing my book Success
Forces in 1980. Since it was a book format and I was not under
the same constraints as when I wrote my advertising copy, it wasan easy process. In fact, it is a lot easier writing anything otherthan direct response advertising copy. You have the freedom touse as many words as you wish to express a thought or feeling.And you have no space restrictions.
Copy Has Space Restrictions
But with advertising copy you do have space restrictions. Your
copy has a very focused purpose—to motivate your prospects toexchange their hard-earned money for your product or service.And everything you do or write must lead to this one goal.
Let me give you one example from an ad that I wrote. We’ll
look at my ﬁrst draft of the initial two paragraphs, which con-
102UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
Axiom 14
======================================== [Página 127] ========================================

tained 66 words, and then the ﬁnal draft, which contained 43
words. We’ll then study the two versions and certain lessons willemerge. The ad was for a bathroom scale, and here’s the ﬁrst draft:
Losing weight is not easy. Ask anyone.
And, if you’ve tried it, you know that part of a good weight re-
duction program is your bathroom scale. A bathroom scale is likea report card. It’s a feedback mechanism that tells you how wellyou’ve done. In fact, one of the few pleasures of losing weight isstepping on your bathroom scale and seeing the positive results.
Now let’s take the same ad and condense it to reduce the
word count while still maintaining the same meaning and emo-tional feel.
Losing weight is not easy. Ask anyone.
One of the few pleasures of losing weight is stepping on your
bathroom scale and seeing positive results. Your bathroom scaleis like a report card—a feedback mechanism that tells you howwell you’ve done.
In the second paragraph there is a reduction from 59 words
to 36. With nearly 40 percent fewer words, the meaning andemotional appeal of the second version is exactly the same as theﬁrst or even better.
Apply this percentage to a full-page ad with 1,000 words
and you can see the difference the editing process can make. Infact, at this point, let’s look at the advantages.
Advantages of Fewer Words
With less copy, your ad will look less imposing to the prospect
and he or she will be more likely to read it. The second advantageis that you are making the slippery slide even more slippery bymaking it shorter. Your prospect will get to the bottom of the slidemuch faster, yet still get the full impact of your sales message.
The preceding example was given to my seminar class and
they spent about 20 minutes coming up with their own edited ver-sions of the ad. Many of them were excellent and some were evenshorter than my version. Of course, the copy was taken out ofcontext; they didn’t have the rest of the ad and couldn’t see farenough into the ad to see what my environment, goal and emo-tional appeal for the product were, so this might not be the perfect

example. But it brought out many of the principles of good edit-
ing. The following are ﬁve of the principles they learned:
Some Principles of Editing
1. Look for any “that” words. For example, in my ﬁrst draft I
used the words, “And, if you’ve tried it, you know that .... ”
The words up to and including “that” can very often be elimi-nated. In this example, I could eliminate eight words.
2. Edit for rhythm. Make sure that you vary the length of sen-
tences so they don’t sound monotonous. I discuss rhythm laterin this book, in Chapter 18.
3. Consider combining sentences. Note that in the edited ver-
sion, I combined the two sentences that read, “A bathroomscale is like a report card. It’s a feedback mechanism that tellsyou how well you’ve done.” I condensed it into “Your bath-room scale is like a report card—a feedback mechanism thattells you how well you’ve done.” I saved only one word bydoing this, but it made sense to combine the sentences andeliminating even one word is a good move.
4. Eliminate unnecessary words. Look at the word “the” in the
phrase “and seeing the positive results.” The word “the” caneasily be eliminated without changing the meaning so that theﬁnal sentence will read, “and seeing positive results.”
5. Rearrange thoughts so they ﬂow better. Note that in the ﬁrst
draft, the ﬂow of the copy pointed out that the scale was a re-port card and the second thought was that part of the pleasureof a weight loss program was stepping on a scale and seeingthe positive results. By reversing these two thoughts, I madethe ad more emotional by focusing on the pleasure of using ascale when losing weight and then I explained why. Thissounds a lot better and more logical from a ﬂow standpointthan the ﬁrst draft.
Take as Long as You Need
Sometimes editing is like raising and nurturing your child and
you need to take a lot of time. You may end up doing 10 draftsbefore you get to the ﬁnal draft. Other times it may ﬂow right outof your mind with hardly a correction.
When Frank Schultz, the grapefruit marketer, attended my
104UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
======================================== [Página 129] ========================================

seminar and wrote his famous grapefruit ad, it was so close to
perfect that it didn’t need much editing at all. When Joe Karbo,who wrote The Lazy Man’s Way to Riches, attended my seminar,
he told the class that after his ad was written, other than twowords that needed correction, the ad was perfect. In contrast,other seminar participants who had a great deal of copywritingexperience spent many hours editing their ads.
And the same holds true for me. I’ve written ad copy that
ﬂowed right out of my brain through my pen, or later my com-puter, and never had to be edited much. Most of the time,though, I would have to go through several drafts before I wassatisﬁed. And then there is the experience factor. The more youwrite, the less editing you have to do. The easier the ﬂow out ofyour brain, the better you are at expressing the emotional feel ofcopy and the excitement that each word represents.
The novice copywriter will usually need the editing process
to craft and polish an ad, whereas the experienced copywriterhas many of the editing mechanisms programmed in his or herbrain. The copy seems to ﬂow out through a ﬁlter that comesonly from experience.
However, the need for editing is sometimes unpredictable
regardless of your experience. You could produce copy thatneeds plenty of editing or you could end up with excellent copythat never needs much at all.
Read the Periodicals
I’m always amazed at the lack of editing I see in many of the pe-
riodicals I read. Phrases like “Finally, it is important to note that. . .” can be totally eliminated and not affect the ﬂow or under-standing of what follows. Another example: “Fortunately or un-fortunately as the case may be . . .” is not really required to makethe information that follows clearer. Many of the articles writtenin periodicals contain these unnecessary preliminaries that ﬁll upspace but mean very little. In writing effective copy you can’t af-ford to be too wordy.
If you’d like a little practice, take a look at the examples
that follow and edit them yourself, or read any periodical andedit the copy by seeing how many extraneous words can beeliminated. Or write a draft and practice this critical skill.

words and still

Example 1:
About the only redeeming feature of this product is that we don’t
have huge quantities to sell. The importer is afraid to order toomany for fear that nobody in their right mind would buy it letalone sell it. So we only have a few hundred to sell as part of thistest program.
Example 2:
I was sitting in an ofﬁce in New York City talking to a very suc-
cessful friend and businessman whom we’ll call Stuart. I toldStuart that I had to make a very critical decision in my business. Ineeded some guidance and advice.
When I started writing a great deal of copy in the 1970s, I
would use a legal pad and ballpoint pen and write my draft inlonghand. I would then give it to my secretary, who would typeit out for me in rough draft form, usually double-spaced.
I would then make my editing corrections and hand it back to
my secretary for her to retype. And this process would continuefor several drafts until it was in a ﬁnal form for the typesetter.
Computers Are a Great Help
When computers with word processing programs ﬁrst came on
the scene, I resisted using them. I was used to writing the copy inlonghand and to switch to a computer and keyboard seemed dif-ﬁcult. But I made the transition sometime in the early 1980s onan Apple II computer and I haven’t looked back since.
Writing copy on a computer makes the editing process very
easy. Word processing allows you to pick words or entire sen-tences and drag them to another place in the copy. Sophisticatedspell-checkers whiz through copy and correct your spelling evenas you type. Thesauruses, grammar-checkers and all sorts ofediting aids are built into every decent word processing program.Today, I never have to give a draft to a secretary. I type it in draftform ﬁrst on the computer and then do all my editing, often be-fore I even print my copy. The computer has done more for mycopywriting and editing than any other single factor, and it ismaking a difference for copywriters everywhere.
Another technique that will help you in the editing process
is time. If you can put aside your copy after you edit it and lookat it the next day or even in a few days, you will often discover
106UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS
======================================== [Página 131] ========================================

things that you never saw before. If time is critical, put the copy
down for a short while and then get back to it. The key is to al-low time for your subconscious mind to digest what you’ve doneand pick out the areas that need work.
Many other rules for editing can be found in English text-
books and style books. There are also other books on writingthat cover this subject very nicely. In fact, it was a book I readin college that really opened my mind to the importance of edit-ing in the copywriting process.
Finally, after you think you have that perfect ﬁnal draft—a
draft so well edited that you can’t possibly make one more correc-tion—ask somebody who is a professional editor or an English ma-jor to correct the English and grammar that you missed. This doesnot mean that you have to accept all of the changes. Sure, you wantto correct the spelling and the dangling modiﬁers and any other in-stances of terrible grammar that may negatively impress yourprospects. But then simply weigh each one of the changes and ifyou feel that any interfere with the style of your writing and youroriginal version does not violate grammar or spelling rules, then ig-nore them. The point is, don’t be intimidated if you don’t feel com-fortable with somebody else’s suggestions to change your writing.
The Use of Commas
A good example is the use of commas. There are two schools of
thought—one that uses a lot of commas and the other that doesnot. I do not believe in too many commas as they take up space.And as a copywriter you don’t have much space to work with.So I use commas where the rules of grammar are clear that theyare needed for clariﬁcation. I don’t use commas in places whereI am not violating any grammatical rules or where they are con-sidered optional. For example, when three items are grouped to-gether, such as “apples, oranges and tomatoes,” I don’t use aserial comma after “oranges.”
I would have both my sister Judy, who is a high school
teacher, and Mary Stanke, my associate at JS&A, proof all mycopy. I didn’t accept all their changes but I certainly paid a lot ofattention to them.
It is important that you do make your copy as free from er-
ror as possible. If you don’t, it reﬂects badly on the integrity of
107THE EDITING PROCESS
======================================== [Página 132] ========================================

your offer. It raises doubts in the minds of your readers. They
may think, “If this guy can’t get his grammar straight, how do Iknow he runs his business right?”
A good example of how a prospect thinks is reﬂected in a
letter I received from an irate reader of one of the airline maga-zines in which we ran the ad for our Consumers Hero club. Wereceived the following:
Dear Sir: Despite the intended conversational tone of the at-
tached advertisement, no license within consumer-oriented adwriting permits the type of glaring poor grammar usage circled inparagraph ﬁve of your copy. “We better not” may occur insloppy, colloquial speech, but it is not acceptable in writing. Thephrase should read, “we’d better not,” of course.
I cannot believe that your ad agency would permit such poor
prooﬁng in an ad which ﬁnds its way into the hands of a sharp con-sumer such as the type which pays the kind of money required topurchase an airline ticket today, and thus is inﬂicted with this badgrammar in a captive audience magazine like the attached.
The above individual took the time to write us about a simple
grammar error. How many others saw it and didn’t respond? Andwhenever we do make a mistake, our readers do usually ﬁnd it.
One editing error was actually quite funny. In copy describ-
ing a blood pressure unit, I wrote, “blood pressure can be verydangerous” instead of “high blood pressure can be very danger-ous.” Nobody picked it up. Sometimes I’m amazed at what thepublic misses and what they complain about, but the fact re-mains that in the editing process you really do want to be as thor-ough as possible.
What I have conveyed in this chapter is simply how impor-
tant the editing process is, the value of editing in terms of the ﬁ-nal copy, and some of the logic I use in the editing process.
Now you’re ready for some interesting, subtle and sophisti-
cated insights into copywriting. By now you understand the en-tire copywriting process, can write an ad and edit it. In SectionTwo, I give you some of the signiﬁcant insights I’ve gainedduring years of experience.

Now comes the fun part. In the following chapters you’ll ﬁnd
not only insights and tips on how to write copy but also revelations of what has worked exceptionally well during my 30-year career as a copywriter.
This section contains only ﬁve chapters. But packed into
these chapters is the heart of this book—the basis for the copy Iwrite and many of my copywriting secrets. It’s an education thatcost me millions to learn and you’re going to learn it for the simple price of this book.
In my seminar promotional outline, I listed several topics
that would be presented, one of which was “The 64 Points EveryAd Should Cover.” And very often, my seminar participants, inanticipation of coming to the seminar, would sit down and in advance list some points to see if they could guess what I taughtin the course.
Typically, they knew maybe six or seven of the points. And
typically, they were amazed at what they didn’t know. You’ve already learned the ﬁrst 10 of these points, the graphic elementsof an ad, in Chapter 4. You’re now about to discover the rest—23 copy elements and 31 psychological triggers to buying. Andfrom the other chapters in this section you will further build thebase you need in order to write incredibly effective copy.
So study this section completely and continue to build your
solid copywriting foundation.

======================================== [Página 137] ========================================

Remember our discussion about graphic elements in Chapter 4?
We explained that each of these elements was designed to getprospects to do only one thing—read the ﬁrst sentence. And weexplained how important the ﬁrst sentence was in your copy.
And if we know that all those graphic elements are de-
signed to get you to read the ﬁrst sentence and eventually all ofthe copy, then the next thing we should address is the nature ofthe copy elements in an advertisement.
In this chapter, I will cover all the copy elements and their
relationship to the advertisement—23 concepts that you shouldreview for each ad you write.
1. Typeface: This element is really important. If you’re a
graphic designer, you know that each typeface has its own person-ality, emotion and legibility. And that’s the point of this subject.You’ve got to determine the combination of personality and legi-bility that will make your ad easy to read and inviting. Since weare talking about copy here, we are talking about only one style oftype, called “serif” type. Serif type has short protruding lineswhereas the other style of type, called “sans serif,” doesn’t. Thetype used for the text of this book is serif type. Why? Because inlegibility tests, serif type produced greater comprehension thansans serif type and by a 5 to 1 margin. I didn’t discover this untilwell into my writing career, but now all my ads are printed in seriftype. This was one test I wish I had known about earlier.
Another important factor is the legibility of all your type-
faces in other parts of your ad such as the headline, subheadlineand various headings. Fancy type might look elegant to the typedesigner, but if it can’t be read it has no value. It’s like talking toa foreigner and ﬁnding the words difﬁcult to understand. Themost important role a typeface has is to allow the greatest com-prehension possible, and the second role, less important by far, isto convey the image of a company. 
113Powerful Copy Elements Explained Chapter 18
======================================== [Página 138] ========================================

2. First Sentence: This we discussed in Chapter 4 as the
purpose of all the graphic elements of an ad—to get the prospectto read that all-important ﬁrst sentence. Keep your ﬁrst sentenceshort, easy to read and compelling enough to cause the reader toread the next sentence.
3. Second Sentence: This sentence is almost as important
as the ﬁrst. You’ve got to maintain interest, so you must also cre-ate another sentence with a compelling reason to cause yourreader to want to continue. You must continue this momentumthroughout the ﬁrst and second paragraphs. Put aside any facts,beneﬁts or product features. Your only goal is to get the momen-tum going and create that buying environment.
4. Paragraph Headings: In Chapter 4, paragraph headings
are mentioned as one of the graphic elements in a print ad. Theyare supposed to make the copy look less intimidating, and thusencourage the reader to read all the copy. But paragraph head-ings are also a copy element that needs to be addressed in thischapter as well. 
Paragraph headings could introduce material in the para-
graph that follows or they could have absolutely nothing to dowith the copy underneath or the copy in the entire ad for thatmatter. Remember, they are designed to break up the copy andmake it look less intimidating. They have little to do with sellingor presenting your product. They simply make the copy lookmore inviting so your reader will start the reading process.
When a reader looks at copy that appears like one continu-
ous paragraph, subconsciously it looks a lot more difﬁcult toread than copy that is broken up into neat little chunks headed byvarious paragraph headings.
Use paragraph headings to break up copy in the middle of
columns but not at the very end or beginning. Avoid placing para-graph headings right next to each other in two adjoining columns.
As I just mentioned, your paragraph headings could say
anything. I once ran an ad for a radar speed indicator, and as atest I used the most outrageous paragraph headings you couldthink of. They included “Scrambled Eggs,” “Working and Play-ing” and “Success and Good Things.” Even though the headings
114UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 139] ========================================

had absolutely nothing to do with the ad copy, they drew ab-
solutely no attention. Nobody ever asked me what the headingsmeant or commented that they were not consistent with the copy.But had I misspelled a word in the body of the ad, I would haveheard plenty about it.
The primary purpose of paragraph headings is to get the
reader to read the copy by making the copy look less intimidating.
A secondary purpose might be to arouse curiosity. Maybe my
“Scrambled Eggs” paragraph heading did just that—created cu-riosity and caused somebody to start reading the copy to ﬁnd outwhat scrambled eggs had to do with the product I was offering. Al-though I’ve never tested to see if this was the case, my experiencewith paragraph headings tells me that curiosity does play a minorrole but the main purpose of these headings is to make the copyless intimidating.
5. Product Explanation: Sounds simple. Sounds basic.
But you’ll be amazed at how many ads leave out the simple stepof explaining what the product does. A rule of thumb here is toexplain a complicated product in a very simple way and explaina simple product in a very complex way.
For example, I once sold a smoke detector. At the time it
was a very common household product whose function wasclearly understood by the consumer. In short, the product wassimple. In the ad I wrote for an expensive brand, I told a storyabout the inside workings of my smoke detector. I described thegold contacts (which every other smoke detector had) and evenexplained how the comparator circuit functioned to determine ifthere was smoke in the room. Even though this smoke detectorcost $10 more than the average market price, it was a big suc-cess. The ad illustrates a way to present a simple product in acomplicated way. You should sell a simple product that is clearlyunderstood by the consumer in a more complicated way and amore complicated product in a very simple way.
When I ﬁrst explained the computer to my customers, it
was always a very simple explanation of what it could do forthem. My ad was not about the technology inside (althoughsome reference was made to the inside) but focused on the sim-plicity of the product and its use. At this time, consumers were
115POWERFUL COPY ELEMENTS EXPLAINED
======================================== [Página 140] ========================================

just getting into computers. They were new, seemed complicated
to use and indeed many were. By explaining computers in verysimple and basic terms without getting too complicated, I wasable to ease them into a purchase.
Later, as consumers understood more and the products be-
came a commodity, explaining them in greater detail proved moreeffective.
In addition to the concept of simple versus complex, you
should always check your copy to make sure you have explainedall of the features. Ask yourself, “Did I explain the product sufﬁ-ciently to my prospect?” You might ask a number of people toread your copy to see if they understand the product and its fea-tures. Look at the questions they raise and see if you’ve ad-dressed them fully in your copy.
6. New Features: Highlight those features that make your
product or service new, unique or novel. This might appear to bethe same as the copy element “Product Explanation” that we’vejust discussed, but it is different. Here you are revealing not justthe features of the product, but the features that distinguish itfrom anything else on the market.
7. Technical Explanation: Regardless of the product or
service, each ad can be enhanced with a technical explanation.
We all like to buy something from an expert—somebody we
like, respect and trust. Buying is indeed a process of trust.
The buyer’s thought process might be, “I trust that you re-
ally know your subject and fully understand the product
category and have described your product to me prop-
erly and will give me something of value that I want
in return for my hard-earned money.” 
Trust is always enhanced when the seller has become an
expert at what he or she is selling. Let’s say the seller says, “Ihave studied everything I could on competitive products andknow everything there is about the product I am selling, so Iknow that what I am offering you is the best product at the bestvalue.” You would naturally have a great deal of conﬁdence thatthis seller’s product is indeed good.
You might also be impressed if the seller, in describing the
116UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
A technical
explanation willbuild conﬁdencein the prospect.
======================================== [Página 141] ========================================

product, used words that you didn’t understand. Why? Because
it would appear that the seller really was an expert about theproduct. This is not deception. A seller must become an experton the product in order to talk about it in technical language.
In a mail order ad, technical explanations can add a great
deal of credibility, but before you write them, make sure you in-deed become an expert. If not, the consumer will see rightthrough the ploy.
A good example of this technique is expressed in the follow-
ing caption I wrote for a picture of the integrated circuit in a watch:
A pin points to the new decoder/driver integrated circuit which
takes the input from the oscillator countdown integrated circuitand computes the time while driving the display. This singlespace-age device replaces thousands of solid-state circuits andprovides the utmost reliability—all unique to Sensor.
Very few people would be able to understand the technical
commentary. In fact, when I sent the ad to the manufacturer forapproval, he called my attention to the caption under the pictureand said, “What you wrote there is correct but who is going tounderstand it? Why did you even use it?”
Providing a technical explanation that the reader may not
understand shows that we really did our research and if we sayit’s good, it must be good. It builds conﬁdence in the buyer thathe or she is indeed dealing with an expert. Incidentally, thewatch was one of our best-selling products.
Another example of a technical explanation appeared in the
outline of a seminar. Jimmy Calano of CareerTrack came up tome after I explained the reasons for a technical explanation andsaid, “Joe, do you realize that the outline of one of my seminarsis, in fact, a technical explanation? By using technical terms thatnot too many people understand until they come to the seminar,they sense that we know what we are talking about.”
Yet another example is an ad written by Frank Schultz after
attending my seminar. His product was grapefruit and he was ex-plaining how he graded them:
Even after picking there are other careful inspections each fruit
must pass before I’ll accept it. I size the fruit. And I grade it forbeauty. Sometimes the fruit will be wind scarred. I won’t accept
117POWERFUL COPY ELEMENTS EXPLAINED
======================================== [Página 142] ========================================

it. Or sometimes it will have a bulge on the stem that we call
“sheep nose.” I won’t accept it. You can see I really mean it whenI say I accept only perfect Royal Ruby Reds.
In many of my ads, catalogs, direct mailings and infomercials
I convey thorough knowledge not only of what I am selling but ofthe entire universe of products available. I convey the thoughtprocess I went through in picking the product I chose and why it isbetter than anything similar at a particular price point. And the con-sumer appreciates the effort I took, feels more conﬁdent in the pur-chase and consequently is motivated to reach into his or her pocketand exchange hard-earned money for my product or service.
8. Anticipate Objections: This is a very important element
to consider when writing copy. If you feel that your prospectmight raise some objection when you are describing a product,then raise the objection yourself. Remember, you’re not in frontof the consumer and you have to sense what the next questionmight be. If you sense that there might be an objection and youignore it, it’s like ignoring that consumer. You won’t get awaywith it. The consumer is too sharp and will not buy.
A good example of anticipating objections is in that ad we
saw earlier in Chapter 16 for that expensive electronic pinballgame from Bally Manufacturing. The average consumer wouldraise the question about service. We resolved it in our ad.
Another example of raising an objection is in my ad offer-
ing a thermostat for the home. If you remember from Chapter 8,I looked at the product and saw that it was really ugly. It didn’thave a good design at all. In fact, it would turn me off if I were aconsumer. So I raised the objection at the very beginning of thead, calling it the worst-looking product I’d ever seen. I later jus-tiﬁed the product by calling attention to its spectacular features,but only after I had raised the design objection myself.
Often products that require installation concern consumers.
It is then that you have to raise the question about installationyourself and not hide from the facts.
9. Resolve Objections: Just as you have to recognize ob-
jections, it is your opportunity and duty to resolve the objections,too. You must be honest and provide alternative solutions or dis-
118UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 143] ========================================

pel the objections completely. With the pinball game, we talked
about the modular circuit boards that you simply snap out and ex-change if service is required. More on this later in copy element14, “Service.” In 2006 Gillette introduced its new ﬁve-bladed vi-brating Fusion razor, which uses a small AAA battery located inthe handle of the razor. A consumer might be wondering, “Howlong will the battery last?” But Gillette’s excellent approach wasto both raise the question and answer it with the statement, “Forbest performance, change the battery every six months.”
10. Gender: Who is the consumer? Male, female or both
genders? Are they female golf players, lady pilots or profes-sional women? Make sure there are no sexual or sexist com-ments that would offend any group, and know your targetaudience so that you can communicate in their terms.
I once ran an ad for gold chains in my catalog. It was in the
form of a story about a salesman named Bob Ross who tried toconvince me to sell gold chains. I resisted until he showed me apicture of his cousin who could model the chains in the ad. Iquickly accepted the product after seeing a picture of Bob’scousin. The ad copy was considered by many to be one of mymost creative approaches to selling a product. The chains hadnothing to do with the core products we had been selling—elec-tronic gadgets. However, I did get a few letters as a result. Awoman in Egg Harbor City, New Jersey, wrote:
Dear Sir: Your friend, Mr. Bob Ross, may regard himself as a
successful salesman, but unfortunately he comes across in yourad as a consummate asshole. 
The letter then went on to point out the achievements of women
in many technical ﬁelds, the military, air trafﬁc control, sportsand leisure, racing and several other professions in whichwomen now play a very active role. She ﬁnally concluded:
Perhaps a long, hard look at the person or department responsible
for the ad on page 37 is in order. Apparently he has to “come along way, baby” to catch up to the Twentieth Century. Cordiallywishing you immediate bankruptcy, I remain, 
And with that she signed her name. It was a two-page
single-spaced letter that included a copy of our mailing label.
119POWERFUL COPY ELEMENTS EXPLAINED
======================================== [Página 144] ========================================

Was I really insensitive to women? Did I demean them in my 
ad copy? I’ve reproduced the ad in Chapter 33 and it is called“Gold Space Chains.” See if you agree.
It is also important that you recognize the differences be-
tween men and women in terms of what is important to them.Women are generally into color, fashion, family, home and rela-tionships. Men are more likely into sports, military combat, ma-chines, earning money and supporting their family. Sure, theirroles overlap tremendously today. Women are assuming the rolesthat men once had exclusively and men are doing things todaythat years earlier would have been considered feminine. Beingaware of the differences (and sometimes the lack of differences)is the most important point here. And this awareness can help youharmonize with your target audience by understanding how tocommunicate with them and knowing what might offend them.
11. Clarity: Your copy should be clear, simple, short and to
the point. Avoid big words that confuse those who don’t knowthem and which often establish the writer as a pompous snob—unless, of course, you’re trying to appeal to pompous snobs. Keepit simple. The clearer the copy and the more concise, the easier itwill be for people to read and get on the slippery slide and staythere. The only exception to this rule is when you give a technicalexplanation, as described earlier in copy element 7 in this chapter.
12. Clichés: Avoid the obvious ones: “Here’s the product
the world has been waiting for,” or “It’s too good to be true.” Ifyou feel inclined to use a cliché, don’t. Clichés seem to be usedwhen you have nothing really signiﬁcant or good to say and mustﬁll up space. How do you know if you are writing a cliché? If itsounds like you’re writing typical advertising copy some agencymay have written 20 years ago, that’s one clue.
Have I used them? You bet. My ﬁrst several ads were replete
with them. Back when I wrote them, I didn’t know any better.
For example, in my 1972 ad for a desktop calculator, I stated,
“It’s the breakthrough the world has been waiting for!” Bad, isn’tit? I wrote it then but would never write anything as trite today.The lead sentence for the ﬁrst pocket calculator I introduced in theUnited States in 1971 read, “It’s the most exciting new break-
120UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 145] ========================================

through in electronics since the transistor radio!” Ironically, at the
time it may have actually been more truth than cliché.
13. Rhythm: Just as a song has a rhythm, so does copy. Hu-
mor writers know this well. If you can write good humor, you’vealready got the rhythm thing down pat. In fact, the most difﬁcultcopy to write is humor. Why humor? Because you have to knowhow to build up to a punch line and then deliver it. You have toknow how not to be too obvious in your delivery and you’ve gotto understand the art of timing. So what does this rhythm soundor feel like in advertising copy?
It has no distinct pattern: a short sentence, then a long sen-
tence followed by a medium sentence followed by a short sen-tence and then another short sentence and then one really longsentence. Got it? In short, a mixture of sentence lengths that,when read together, gives a sense of variety and rhythm.
Think about how copy would sound if all the sentences
were very short or very long or all had a distinct predictable pat-tern. Pretty boring. And that’s the point of copy rhythm. Varyyour sentences; vary their length to give your copy a rhythm.
Another rhythm technique is the use of what is called a
“triad.” Very often when I list examples or attributes of something,I use just three of them. For example, take the sentence, “I wentshopping for a hammer, a screwdriver and a pair of pliers.” Incopy you list three items in a series with the last item preceded bythe word and, and you create a nice rhythm within that sentence.
In fact, when you read some of the ads in Section Three of thisbook, you will see how many of them have triads throughout.
14. Service: If you are selling an expensive product or one
that is not easily returned for service, you must address the ques-tion of service and convey the ease of that service to the con-sumer. Often the mention of a brand name manufacturer is allthat is needed to establish ease of service. But if there is a remotepossibility that the consumer would still ask about service, thenyou must address this issue in your ad.
In selling our Bally pinball game by mail, we knew that a
buyer might have concerns about the matter of service. What if thepinball game broke and required repair? It was large and expensive
121POWERFUL COPY ELEMENTS EXPLAINED
======================================== [Página 146] ========================================

and the inconvenience of a broken game would be in the back of
our customers’ minds. We addressed that in the ad. The followingis the subheading and paragraph we used to alleviate any customerconcerns:

Check the instructionbooklet and simply remove the designated plug-in circuit board,light bulb or part and send it to the service department closest toyou for a brand new replacement. Even your TV or stereo isn’t thateasy to repair.
A full paragraph was used to cover the issue of service.
And we sold thousands of pinball machines to people who ordi-narily might not have purchased a unit because of their concernabout service.
Another good example of how important service is to help
sell a product took place during the height of the digital watchboom in the mid-1970s. The industry was expanding veryrapidly but there were problems with the reliability of thesespace-age timepieces. Unlike mechanical watches, these newelectronic timepieces had batteries, used sophisticated chips andcircuitry and had a high defective rate.
I recognized this as a problem that had to be addressed in
our copy. And since I look at problems as opportunities, I won-dered, “Where is the opportunity in this serious and rapidlygrowing problem?” I then came up with the following copy to es-tablish the quality of the product we were offering and our com-mitment to back it.
The Sensor 770 has an unprecedented ﬁve-year parts and labor
unconditional warranty. Each watch goes through weeks of ag-ing, testing and quality control before assembly and ﬁnal inspec-tion. Service should never be required, but if it should anytimeduring the ﬁve-year warranty period, we will pick up your Sensorat your door and send you a loaner watch while yours is being re-paired—all at our expense.
122UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 147] ========================================

Then later in a summary of the offer, we again played up
the part on service.
We have selected the Sensor as the most advanced American-
made, solid-state timepiece ever produced. And we put our com-pany and its full resources behind that selection. JS&A willunconditionally guarantee the Sensor—even the battery—forﬁve years. We’ll even send you a loaner watch to use while yourwatch is being repaired should it ever require repair.
We alleviated any concern about service in the copy of the
ad. If the issue of service was raised in the minds of ourprospects, it was now resolved. By showing such a strong com-mitment to service, we had overcome a major objection that werealized, in advance, could be a problem, and turned it into anopportunity.
Indeed when a customer’s watch did not work, the cus-
tomer would call us on our toll-free number and we would im-mediately send out a package containing a UPS call tag thatallowed UPS to pick up the defective watch free of charge, aloaner watch and a postage-free envelope for the consumer to re-turn the loaner after receiving the repaired watch.
This gave our company the opportunity to prove to our cus-
tomers how consumer-oriented we were. Our customers wereliterally amazed at the way we followed up with our service pro-gram. And after they received their repaired watch, they even gota call from us to make sure everything was okay.
But that’s not the point of this example. If service is a con-
sideration in the subconscious mind of the consumer and you ad-dress it up front, you will melt any resistance to buying yourproduct. The Sensor watch was one of our best-selling watchesand the mailing list of watch customers became one of ourstrongest mailing lists for future offers.
Service in the selling process has been a critical factor in the
success of a personal friend, Joe Girard, who is in The Guinness
Book of World Records for having sold more cars in a single year
than anybody in history. Joe’s books on salesmanship are worthreading for their many insights, but the one factor that made Joesuch an effective salesman (aside from the fact that he was a verypersonable guy) was the way he handled service. His customers’
123POWERFUL COPY ELEMENTS EXPLAINED
======================================== [Página 148] ========================================

service problems became his. And each time he sold a car, Joe be-
came that buyer’s personal service representative. And Joe per-formed. Then when buyers returned for another car, they wantedto buy only from Joe. It wasn’t price that made Joe’s success, al-though that was important; it was his attitude toward service.
15. Physical Facts: In copy you must mention all the phys-
ical facts about a product or you risk reducing your response.I’m talking about weight, dimensions, size, limits, speed, and thelike. Sometimes you might think that a certain dimension isn’t re-ally important or the weight may not be necessary. But it’s nottrue. Give readers any excuse not to buy and they won’t buy.
I remember running ads for products and then personally
taking the orders on our toll-free lines. I did this because it wason the phone lines that I got many of my insights into the buyingprocess. Here were my customers, motivated enough to reachinto their pockets and pull out their hard-earned money for aproduct they trusted me to sell them. What a wonderful oppor-tunity to peek into this process and hear the really subliminal re-actions people made when they responded.
It was during my time on the phone lines that I learned that
if you don’t give all the facts, it gives your customer the excusenot to order. It may be a weight or dimension that you thoughtwas irrelevant, but if you don’t mention it, people will call andask for it. And how many more customers didn’t bother to calland check on it? Of course, they didn’t order, either.
I remember an ad for a scale pictured on the ﬂoor. I didn’t
give the actual weight of the scale itself. “Who would care?” Ithought. But my prospects did care and frequently asked. Weeventually included the weight of the scale in the ad. I remembershowing an object that was being held in my hand. I gave the ex-act dimensions but failed to give the weight because the weightwas not really relevant. I got a lot of calls from people wantingto know the weight before deciding whether to buy.
The point: List the physical dimensions even in cases where
you think they are not that important.
16. Trial Period: With mail order items, you must offer a
trial period for any product that the consumer cannot touch or
124UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 149] ========================================

feel at the time of purchase. The only time you can make an ex-
ception to this rule is when the value is so strong and the productso familiar that the consumer is willing to take the risk. If I wereselling a box of 24 rolls of toilet paper at a bargain price deliv-ered to your home and it was a brand that you already used, thenyou wouldn’t need a trial period. 
Make sure your trial period is at least one month, or even
better, two months. Tests have proven that the longer the trial pe-riod, the less chance the product will be returned and the moreconﬁdence the consumer will have in dealing with you and pur-chasing the item.
Let’s say you receive a product that has a one-week trial pe-
riod. You’ve got one week to make up your mind. You feel thepressure, so you examine the product and try to make the deci-sion as quickly as possible. If you are unsure when the week isalmost up, what do you do? You say, “I’m not sure, so I’m notgoing to take the chance,” and you return it.
But let’s say you have two months to make up your mind.
No pressure there, right? You even have a pretty good feelingabout the company offering the product. The company must beconﬁdent that you’re going to like the product because it is giv-ing you a two-month trial period.
So you put the product aside. You use it freely, not worried
about having to make a decision, and then before you know it thetwo months are up and you’ve not even thought about returningit. Just knowing you could have returned it was enough to makeyou feel comfortable holding on to the purchase.
17. Price Comparison: Whenever possible, offering a
price comparison to another product establishes value in themind of the purchaser. This points out one of the really importantconsiderations that motivate consumers to buy—namely thatthey are getting real value.
An example of a price comparison was my ad for the Sen-
sor watch. I stated:
The $275 Pulsar uses the LED technology which requires press-
ing a button each time you want to review the time. Even the$500 solar-powered Synchronar watch, in our opinion, can’t
125POWERFUL COPY ELEMENTS EXPLAINED
======================================== [Página 150] ========================================

compare with the Sensor and its 5-year warranty. And no solid-
state watch can compare to Sensor’s quality, accuracy, rugged-ness and exceptional value.
If you are selling an expensive item or something that is a
good value when compared to another product, you should al-ways consider a price comparison as a means of establishing thevalue of your product. If your product is the most expensiveproduct being offered, then you want to suggest that it has moreor better features. If your product is less expensive, then youwant to focus on better value and use a price comparison.
But there’s a word of caution. Your comparison must be to-
tally accurate and be 100 percent fair or you could be sued by thecompany whose product you are comparing.
18. Testimonials: A testimonial is a good way to add credi-
bility if it is from a very credible person or organization. This ap-proach can be used not only in the copy but in the headline orphoto. See if your ad copy could use a celebrity for a testimonial,but make sure the testimonial makes sense for the product.
When I was selling a space-age Midex security system, it
made sense to ask Wally Schirra, the famous astronaut, to endorse my product. He did, and the product sold very well. IfI were selling basketball shoes, Michael Jordan would be anatural.
Make sure that the celebrity matches with the product and
adds credibility. The use of a celebrity who doesn’t make sensefor your product or doesn’t add credibility could backﬁre, havethe wrong effect and kill sales if the offer is not believable.
You can also use what I call a “reverse testimonial.” That is
where you don’t use a spokesperson but you refer to your com-petitor’s. For example, when I was selling the Olympus microrecorder, I stated the following:
Headline: Endorsement Battle
Subheadline: A famous golf star endorses the Lanier. Our unit is
endorsed by our president. You’ll save $100 as a result.
Copy: Judge for yourself. That new Olympus micro recorder
shown above sells for $150. Its closest competition is a $250recorder called the Lanier endorsed by a famous golf star.
126UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 151] ========================================

FANCY ENDORSEMENT
The famous golf star is a pilot who personally ﬂies his own Citation
jet. The Olympus recorder is endorsed by JS&A’s president who pi-lots a more cost-efﬁcient single engine Beechcraft Bonanza. Thegolf star does not endorse the Lanier unit for free. After all, a goodportion of his income is derived from endorsing products.
Our president, on the other hand, does not get paid for endorsing
products—just for selling them. And his Bonanza is not as ex-pensive to ﬂy as the golf star’s Citation. In fact, our presidentalso drives a V olkswagen Rabbit.
I then continued to show how inefﬁciently the Lanier was
sold (through a direct selling organization) and how efﬁcientlythe Olympus was sold (via direct marketing and through JS&A).The conclusion: savings of $100 for an even better product—allbecause we didn’t have our product endorsed by an expensivespokesperson.
Another form of testimonial is from the man on the street—
used primarily on TV . I’ve used them extensively in myBluBlocker infomercials. And ﬁnally, another one could comefrom those people who use your product and send you an unso-licited testimonial. Whatever testimonial you do use, make sure itis authentic and honest. The public will see right through a lie andthe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) won’t be far behind.
19. Price: Another important copy point to consider is the
price. Should the price be obvious? Should it be set in large type?Small? These are important considerations and must be examined.
If you’re selling a product or service at a very good price,
then set the price in larger type. After all, you want people to seethat beneﬁt very clearly. If the product is expensive and it’s notthe price that will sell it, you want to underplay it. Don’t hide it;just underplay it.
As I write my ad I have always anticipated the questions
my prospects will ask. There is one exception. I never knowwhen they are going to wonder about the price of the product. Ihave always felt that the point at which your reader will want toﬁnd out about the price could happen anytime during the readingprocess. It could happen before they read the ad. It could happenhalfway through or it could happen near the end. You must, as an
127POWERFUL COPY ELEMENTS EXPLAINED
======================================== [Página 152] ========================================

effective copywriter, answer the question when it is being raised
by the reader.
By putting the price in a logical position in the copy—
whether it be in the coupon, which is the ideal place, or in thecopy highlighted with a bold typeface—you are answering thequestion that the reader asks without knowing when the reader isready to ask the question. The reader simply scans the ad and ifthe price is in bold or in the coupon, the price will pop out andanswer the question.
20. Offer Summary: It’s a really good idea to summarize
what you are offering the consumer somewhere near the end ofyour ad. “So here’s my offer. Order two pots with Teﬂon coatingand you’ll receive the two pots plus our handy cookbook andvideo for the price of only $19.95.” You’ll be surprised at howmany ads miss this important point.
21. Avoid Saying Too Much: This is probably the biggest
mistake my students make. They say too much. There are reallytwo issues here. The ﬁrst issue is one of editing. It is normal tosay as much as you can about a subject and then reﬁne the copyto a point where it ﬂows smoothly. This usually means editingand reducing the copy length until it has rhythm and it ﬂows.This could take time and involves a few steps.
First, say to yourself as you go through the editing process,
“Is there a simpler way of saying this?” Very often you can cutyour copy down 50 to even 80 percent and still say the samething. It’s the difference between a salesperson who talks toomuch and one who is to the point and succinct. Wouldn’t yourather be sold by the one who is to the point?
There is another issue involved with not saying too much,
and later in this book in the “Mental Enagement” section ofChapter 19 I explain how not saying too much will actually en-hance and even stimulate the selling process. Chapter 17 on edit-ing also has ideas that will help you reduce your copy.
22. Ease of Ordering: Make it easy to order. Use a toll-free
number, a coupon, a tear-off reply card or any vehicle that iseasy to understand and use. My recommendation: Use a coupon
128UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 153] ========================================

with dotted lines. In tests, it usually generates more response be-
cause the dotted lines clearly convey at a glance that you can or-der the product from the ad.
23. Ask for the Order: Always ask for the order near 
the end of your ad. This is often forgotten by many copywrit-ers. At the end of an ad, I state the following or somethingsimilar: “I urge you to buy this at no obligation, today.” Haveyou ever met a salesperson who has already sold you and youare waiting for the salesperson to ask you for the order but heor she never does? It’s happened to me. And it is one of theproblems with a lot of inexperienced salespeople. You’ve gotto ask for the order, and if you’re doing it right, it should be atthe very end of the ad where you’ve ﬁnished selling yourprospect, you’ve summarized the offer and your prospect isready to buy.
These 23 copy elements are points you want to consider
when you are writing copy. Use this chapter as a checklist whenyou get started. Consider all of these points when you write anad. Can some of them be eliminated? Possibly. But simply by us-ing them as a checklist, you might discover a few deﬁciencies inyour ad copy that can be corrected with my suggestions andmight result in enhancing your response.
One of the other beneﬁts of the list is to give you an in-
sight into the relative importance of the various copy elements.Some, like the paragraph headings, have little purpose otherthan to make the copy less imposing. Others, like resolving ob-jections, can make a dramatic difference in the credibility ofyour copy.
Use the convenient copy elements checklist located 
in Appendix C in the back of this book and make a copy to keep right next to your computer or desk when you are writ-ing an ad.
But the really interesting part of my checklist is in the next
chapter where you’ll learn about the psychological triggers thatneed to be considered when you write an ad. You ﬁrst learnedabout the 10 graphic elements and their purpose (to get you toread the ﬁrst sentence of the copy) in Chapter 4. You have just
129POWERFUL COPY ELEMENTS EXPLAINED
======================================== [Página 154] ========================================

learned 23 copy concepts and how they are to be used. Now
learn the 31 psychological triggers—the underlying motiva-tional messages that good direct response copy should convey,often in subtle but very effective ways. When I was teaching myseminar course, this was the part my students enjoyed the most.So read on.
130UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 155] ========================================

The 31 psychological triggers are probably going to be the most
interesting of the 64 points you want to consider when writing adirect response print ad or any kind of selling message.
The ﬁrst part of the 64-point checklist involves the 10
graphic elements of an ad—those elements designed to get youto read the ﬁrst sentence. The previous chapter covered 23 pointsto consider when writing the actual copy. But now get ready forthe psychology that should be considered when writing your ad-vertising message—concepts that took me years of failure, expe-rience and gradual insight to understand and implement.
You may understand and relate to some of these concepts
right away. Some you may not fully understand without experi-encing them yourself. And ﬁnally, some will require a fairly de-tailed explanation.
If you’ve found this book informative so far, you will ﬁnd
this chapter fascinating. So let’s start.
1. Feeling of Involvement or Ownership
I was once told this story by a master salesman who worked at aTV and appliance store. He was the most successful salesman thisstore ever had. He consistently beat out all the other salesmen. Hehad some very good sales techniques, but that wasn’t what im-pressed me. It was the way he decided in advance who his bestprospects might be.
What he would do was stand in an aisle watching cus-
tomers walk into the store. He would observe them. If theywalked up to a TV set and started turning the knobs, he knewthat he had a 50 percent chance of selling them. If they didn’tturn the knobs, he had a 10 percent chance of selling them.This was before remote controls.
131The Psychological Triggers Chapter 19
======================================== [Página 156] ========================================

Direct response advertising doesn’t give you the opportuni-
ties of observing your prospects. You are not there to see anyknobs being turned. But you can get them to turn the knobs bygiving them a feeling of involvement with or ownership of theproduct you are selling.
In all my ads I try to make the prospects imagine they are
holding or using my product. For example, in one of my earliercalculator ads, I might have said, “Hold the Litronix 2000 inyour hand. See how easily the keys snap to the touch. See howsmall and how light the unit is.” I create through imagination thereader’s experience of turning the knobs.
In short, I take the mind on a mental journey to capture the
involvement of the reader. I make the reader believe that he orshe could indeed be holding the calculator and experiencing thevery same things that I’ve described. It’s mental energy creatinga picture for the prospect, whose mind is like a vacuum waitingto be ﬁlled.
In your copywriting, let your readers take a stroll down a
path with you or let them smell the fragrance through your noseor let them experience some of the emotions you are feeling byforming a mental picture from your description.
If I were writing an advertisement for the Corvette sports
car, I might say, “Take a ride in the new Corvette. Feel the breezeblowing through your hair as you drive through the warmevening. Watch heads turn. Punch the accelerator to the ﬂoor andfeel the burst of power that pins you into the back of your con-tour seat. Look at the beautiful display of electronic technologyright on your dashboard. Feel the power and excitement ofAmerica’s super sports car.”
I would still explain all the special features of the car—the
logic upon which to justify its purchase—but I would really playup that feeling of involvement and ownership.
This technique is used in many different ways. In direct re-
sponse, it is often referred to as an involvement device—something that involves the consumer in the buying process.Sometimes it may seem silly. Have you ever received those so-licitations that say, “Put the ‘yes’ disk into the ‘yes’ slot and we will send you a trial subscription to our new magazine”? I often
132UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 157] ========================================

wonder who invented that seemingly simpleminded and juvenile
concept. Yet, as direct marketers will tell you, this type of in-volvement device often doubles and triples response rates. It’snot simpleminded at all but rather a very effective direct responseinvolvement technique.
The reader becomes involved in the solicitation. Similarly,
your reader is either taking action or imagining taking actionthrough the power of the words you write.
The Involvement of TV and the Internet
TV and the Internet are great examples of involvement. You see,hear and can almost touch the product. It is no wonder that TVand the Internet are among the most effective ways to sell.
My own daughter, when she was four years old, clearly
demonstrated how you can get involved in the sales message.There was a Peanuts Valentine’s Day TV special and my daugh-ter Jill was sitting and watching the show with her seven-year-old sister, April. My wife, who was watching as well, told methis fascinating story.
Charlie Brown was passing out Valentine cards in a classroom and
was reading off names of the recipients, “Sarah, Mary, Sally . . . Jill.Where’s Jill?” said Charlie Brown. My daughter immediatelyraised her hand and said, “Here.” She was so involved in watchingthe show that she felt like she was a part of it.
I use involvement devices quite often. An involvement de-
vice that ties in with what you are selling can be very effective.Let me give you a perfect example from an ad that I wrote. Theresults really surprised me.
The product I was offering was the Franklin Spelling Com-
puter—a device that helped correct your spelling. It was a nov-elty when it ﬁrst appeared and it sold quite well. Although Iwasn’t the ﬁrst to sell it, I had a model that was a little more so-phisticated than the ﬁrst version.
I examined the product and felt it was priced too high. But
the manufacturer would be pretty upset with me if I were to dropthe price. So I tried an involvement device as a method of lower-ing the price.
First, I wrote an ad that described the product but with an
133THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
======================================== [Página 158] ========================================

unusual premise. The ad that I wrote had several misspelled
words. If you found the misspelled words, circled them and sentthe ad with the misspelled words circled, you would get $2 off theprice of the computer for each misspelled word you circled. Myconcept was simple. If you didn’t ﬁnd all the misspelled words,you paid more for the computer, but then again, the computer wasworth more to you than to somebody who found all the mistakes.
I ran the ﬁrst ad in the Wall Street Journal and the responses
poured in. I also received a few phone calls from people I hadn’theard from in years. “Joe, I want you to know, I spent the lasthour and a half trying to ﬁnd all the words and I don’t even in-tend on buying your damn computer. I normally don’t read theentire Wall Street Journal for that length of time.”
I Even Made More Money
And the response was surprising. I anticipated that the readers
would ﬁnd all the misspelled words. In fact, even the wordmispelled was misspelled. When the response was ﬁnally tallied,
to my amazement, people only caught, on average, half of thewords and I earned a lot more money than I had expected fromthe ad. And, of course, those who really needed the computer gotreal value.
The feeling of ownership is a concept that is pretty close to
the feeling of involvement, but here you are making readers feelthat they already own the product and you’re letting them use theirimaginations as you take them through the steps of what it wouldbe like if they already owned it. An example might be, “When youreceive your exercise device, work out on it. Adjust the weights.See how easy it is to store under your bed. . . .” In short, you aremaking them feel that they have already bought the product.
Advertising copy that involves the reader can be quite effec-
tive—especially if the involvement device is part of the advertis-ing. Whenever you write an ad, keep this very important conceptin mind. It can make direct response copy far more effective.
2. Honesty
If I had to pick the single most important point of the 64 points, Iwould pick honesty. Your advertising must be honest. This doesn’t
134UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 159] ========================================

mean that if you are dishonest in your message you won’t
achieve a successful result. Give the consumer a price that’s toohard to believe or a product that doesn’t live up to its claims andyou might be able to get away with it once, maybe even twice,but not for the long haul.
But this section on honesty is not about whether you can get
away with being dishonest and for how long. It’s about honestyas a psychological selling tool. First, let’s start out with a veryimportant premise.
Consumers are very smart—smarter than you think and
smarter collectively than any single one of us. With all the ex-perience I have in marketing products and with all the productknowledge I’ve gained over the past 35 years, you can take myword for it, the consumer is quite sharp.
The consumer can also tell whether people are truthful in
what they are trying to communicate. And the more truthful youare in your advertising, the more effectively your message willbe accepted by your prospects.
Try to lie in your copy and you are only deceiving yourself.
Your copy will say what you think you wanted it to say, but itwill also say what you thought you covered up. Even a readerwho hurries over your copy can feel the difference.
When I wrote a JS&A ad, I would include many of the nega-
tive features of my products. I would point out the ﬂaws up front.And of course, I would explain why the ﬂaws really didn’t amountto much and why the consumer should still buy my product. Con-sumers were so impressed with this approach and had such trust inour message that they would eagerly buy what we offered.
And it seemed that the more truthful and frank my ads
were, the more the consumers responded. I soon realized thattruthfulness was one of the best advertising lessons I had everlearned.
Consumers really appreciate the truth. And since they are
smarter than you or I, you can’t fake the truth. They’ll pick out aphony statement every time.
I learned to make every communication to my customers
truthful, whether it be on national television or in my print ads.And the more truthful I am, the more responsive my customers.
135THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
======================================== [Página 160] ========================================

3. Integrity
Not too far from honesty is integrity. An advertisement is a per-
sonal message from an organization or an individual and is a di-rect reﬂection of the writer’s personality and integrity. You canconvey this integrity by the truthfulness of your message, thelook of your ad, the image that you convey and even the typefacesthat you use.
Integrity can be reﬂected by the choices you make in the
layout of your ad. Is it clean and neat? Or is it shouting out atyou with color bars running in different directions and headlinesscreaming and words underlined and pictures exaggerated? Youget the idea. The integrity of the person delivering the message isalways amazingly clear to the recipient. And this integrity is of-ten reﬂected by the appearance of the advertisement and thecopy you write. Show good integrity and your advertising mes-sage will be well received. Don’t show it and join the ranks ofthose who are rarely successful.
4. Credibility
If you convey honesty and integrity in your message, chancesare you’ve gone a long way toward establishing your credibility.However, credibility is not just honesty and integrity. Credibilityis being believable. In an ad for a product whose price is excep-tionally low, you’ve got to convey that the offer you are making,as great as it may seem, is indeed a valid offer. 
Let’s say you are offering something for $10 that everybody
else is selling for $40. Your job is establishing credibility foryour price. You might explain that you are buying a very largevolume from the Far East and that you were able to buy the re-maining stock from a major manufacturer for a very low price.In short, you’ve got to establish the credibility of your companyand your offer.
Credibility also means truthfulness. Does the consumer re-
ally believe you? Rash statements, clichés and some exaggera-tions will remove any credibility your offer may have had.
One of the most important factors that could affect credi-
136UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 161] ========================================

bility is not resolving all the objections that are raised in your
readers’ minds, such as hiding something or avoiding an obviousfault of the product or service. You need to raise all objectionsand resolve them.
Products that require installation or assembly are good ex-
amples. If it is obvious that a product doesn’t just pop out of thebox ready to use, you must explain that it does require assembly.You might say something like, “To make it easy, we provide youwith the tools. In our tests, it only took ﬁve minutes for some-body with very little mechanical skill to put it together.” Onceagain, it is the anticipation of objections and their resolution thatmeans so much to the credibility of an ad.
You are in essence sensing the next question the consumer
may ask and answering it in a straightforward, honest and cred-ible way. The integrity of your product, your offer and yourselfare all on the line, and unless you convey the highest credibilityin your ad, your prospects will not feel comfortable buyingfrom you.
When I appear on QVC—the TV home shopping channel—
it is easy to sell a difﬁcult product that normally would require alot of credibility. The reason: QVC already has a lot of credibilitywith their customers. If a product is being offered on QVC, it mustbe good. It must have the quality that customers have come to ex-pect, and chances are the product will be bought by somebodywho has bought products before from QVC and already feels thatthe company is a very credible concern. In short, I’ve piggybackedmy product onto QVC’s credibility, and the combination ofQVC’s credibility and my product’s credibility is pretty powerful.
The effect of credibility also extends to the magazines or
newspapers in which you advertise. If you advertise your prod-uct in the Wall Street Journal , you are piggybacking onto their
credibility and their constant vigilance, making sure their readersaren’t being taken advantage of. On the other hand, place thatsame ad in the National Enquirer and you then take on the lack
of credibility that this publication has established in the mind ofthe reader. Again, credibility is affected by the environment inwhich you place your advertisement.
You can enhance credibility through the use of a brand
137THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
======================================== [Página 162] ========================================

name product. For example, if I’m offering an electronic product
by the name of Yorx with the exact same features as one whosebrand name is Sony, which one has more credibility?  The Sonywould probably sell better if both were at the same price.
Adding an appropriate celebrity endorser is another effec-
tive way to enhance credibility. The name of a company can, too.For example, there was a company by the name of The ToolShack selling computers. This company’s name actually de-tracted from the credibility of the product it was selling. We onceran the same ad in the Wall Street Journal to test the effect of our
JS&A name against a lesser-known name—Consumers Hero. Inthe test, the JS&A ad far outpulled the other ad. Only the nameof the company was different. Sometimes a city or state can addcredibility. That’s why some companies located in smaller citieshave ofﬁces in London, Paris or New York. The various ways ofadding credibility should be an important consideration in craft-ing your advertising.
5. Value and Proof of Value
Even if you are a multimillionaire, you want to know that you arenot being taken advantage of, and even more importantly, thatyou are getting value for your ﬁnancial investment.
In an ad, the copywriter wants to convey, through examples
or by comparison, that what the customer is buying is a goodvalue. A typical example in one of my ads is where I comparemy prices to products with similar features and point out that I’mproviding a better value. 
By positioning your product and comparing it with others
or by proving the value of something even though the value maynot be apparent, you are providing the logic with which theprospect can justify the purchase. 
Simply educating the reader to the intrinsic value of your
product is equivalent to lowering its price. In short, there is a valueassociated with the education you are providing your reader.
The buying transaction is an emotional experience that uses
logic to justify the buying decision. You buy a Mercedes auto-mobile emotionally but you then justify its purchase logically
138UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 163] ========================================

with its technology, safety and resale value. So justifying its
value is something that the consumer wants to do before makingan emotional purchase.
And with such intense competition in the world, there is a
question in the mind of the consumer: “Am I buying the productat the best price?” Once again, you must resolve that question oryou are not communicating effectively with your prospect.
6. Justify the Purchase
One of the questions people may think about while reading an adis “Can I really justify this purchase?” Once again, it is a ques-tion that is raised and then must be resolved. If you don’t resolveit, then you won’t answer all the prospect’s questions and thiswill give the prospect the excuse to “think about it” and, ofcourse, never buy.
Somewhere in your ad, you should resolve any objection by
providing some justiﬁcation to the purchaser. Sometimes it’s justsaying, “You deserve it.” And other times you might have to jus-tify it in terms of savings (the price is a one-time-only value),health reasons (protects your eyes), recognition (the men in yourlife will love the way you look in it) or dozens of other reasonsbased on the wants and needs of your prospect.
People often tell me, “Joe, when I read your ads, I feel
guilty if I don’t buy the product.” That’s quite a compliment andprobably due to the way I justify a purchase in the mind of theconsumer.
The higher the price point, the more need there is to justify
the purchase. The lower the price point or the more value theprice represents, the less you have to justify the purchase. In fact,the lower the price, the more greed plays a role.
7. Greed
Greed in the form of attraction to bargains is a very strong mo-tivating factor. I don’t know how many times I’ve boughtthings even though I didn’t need them simply because theywere a bargain.
139THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
======================================== [Página 164] ========================================

Don’t hesitate to recognize greed as a very strong factor in
either low-priced merchandise or expensive products offered atlow prices. Too low a price may diminish your credibility unlessyou justify the low price. Many people are willing to risk deal-ing with an unknown vendor just to pay less and get more fortheir money. Providing the consumer with more than what isnormally received for the price is a way of appealing to the con-sumer’s greed.
In one of my earlier ads in the Wall Street Journal, I offered
a calculator for $49.95 and the manufacturer got really upsetwith me. “That product should have sold for $69.95 and now Ihave dealers all over the country calling me and complaining,”screamed the manufacturer.
“Don’t worry,” I said. “I’ll correct it.” So I ran a small ad in
theWall Street Journal announcing my error, raising the price from
$49.95 to $69.95 and giving consumers just a few days to respondat the old price. Even though the size of the ad was considerablysmaller, it outpulled the previous one as people rushed to buy thecalculator within those few days at the $49.95 bargain price.
Greed is not a technique that can be employed all the time.
But it should be recognized as an effective element that plays oneverybody’s weakness.
When you lower the price of a product, you usually end up
with more unit sales. Keep lowering the price, and you’ll con-tinue to generate more unit sales than before if the price drop isbig enough. Go too low and you’ll have to add a little justiﬁca-tion for the lower price as it will start raising credibility issueswith your prospects.
Greed is really not a very positive human trait. But it exists
and it is a force to consider when communicating with yourprospects.
8. Establish Authority
There’s always something that you can say about your companyto establish your authority, size, position or intention. The con-sumer loves to do business with experts in a particular area.
140UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 165] ========================================

That’s why the trend is away from department stores that sell
general merchandise to category stores that sell a speciﬁc line ofproducts. These stores have more expertise, knowledge and au-thority in a speciﬁc category.
For example, for years I would call JS&A “America’s
largest single source of space-age products.” What I was reallydoing was establishing the authority of JS&A as a major supplierof space-age products. The words “single source” really meantthat we shipped our products out of a single location. We may not have shipped more space-age products than Sears or Ra-dioShack, but we shipped more out of a single location and we specialized only in space-age products.
Establishing your authority is something that should be
done in each ad regardless of how big or how little you are.For example, “America’s largest supplier of specialized prod-ucts for the chimney sweep industry.” (One of my seminar par-ticipants was actually in the chimney sweep industry.) Or evenif you are the smallest, you can always say, “The hardest-working bunch of guys in the advertising business.” If you re-ally examine your company, you will ﬁnd something you cansay that establishes your authority and expertise in what youare selling.
Then, after you establish your authority, there is going to be
the temptation to stop using the phrase that established your au-thority. I know that when we had run our phrase for almost sixyears I wondered if we really needed it. But there were alwaysthose ﬁrst-time readers who caught the ad and needed that reas-surance that they were dealing with an authoritative company inthe ﬁeld in which they were contemplating a purchase. Thatphrase gave them the conﬁdence.
Sometimes it is easy to establish authority by virtue of the
name of the company. American Symbolic Corporation was acompany I set up once whose name sounded like it was a verybig operation. Jack and Ed’s Video doesn’t sound very big at all.Computer Discount Warehouse gives you a pretty good idea oftheir authority. It has name recognition, plus it tells you what thecompany is through its name.
141THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
======================================== [Página 166] ========================================

People Respect Authority
People naturally respect a knowledgeable authority. Let’s say you
want to buy a computer. You might ﬁrst check with the expert inyour neighborhood who is known as the neighborhood computergenius. Let’s call him Danny. He has established his authority andyou feel quite comfortable going to Danny to get advice. He’llthen tell you what he thinks you should buy and from whom. Andchances are, he’ll recommend some retail outlet that has estab-lished itself with some level of authority. It might be the cheapestcomputer company or maybe the company that provides the bestservice. You’ll seek out the type of authority you need.
Sometimes the authority does not even have to be stated but
can be felt by the copy, the layout or the message of an ad. Es-tablish your authority in the ﬁeld of the product or service youare selling and you’ll ﬁnd that it will make a big difference inyour copy’s effectiveness.
Let me give you a personal example of something that re-
ally illustrates the point. As I was about to walk into a local busi-ness supply store in Las Vegas, a young lady came running up tome and said, “Please, could you help me?”
I was a little surprised by the suddenness of her approach
and, in fact, ﬁrst thought that there was some kind of emergency.“Sure, what’s the problem?”
Almost with tears in her eyes, she answered, “I’m about to
buy a computer and I’ve picked out the one I like the most, but Ineed somebody to tell me if I’ve made the right choice. If youknow about computers, could you come in the store with me andgive me your opinion?”
I agreed and went into the store with her. The girl explained
that she was attending college at UNLV (the University of Nevadaat Las Vegas) and since this was her ﬁrst computer, she needed re-assurance from somebody who knew computers that this was agood and wise purchase. She told me how most of the people in thestore really didn’t know that much about computers. I looked overthe computer and, having pretty good knowledge about home com-puters, told her that she had indeed made a wise choice and that thecomputer was also a good value. I pointed out some of the techni-cal features that would help her in her schoolwork, and although
142UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 167] ========================================

she didn’t have any idea of what I was talking about, she felt that
she was making the right choice because I said so.
Nobody Wants to Make a Mistake
Relieved, she thanked me, and then was off to buy her new com-puter. As she was walking away, she looked over her shoulderand said, “I’ve worked hard for my money and I didn’t want tomake a stupid mistake.”
Before you bought a computer, you may have ﬁrst called
somebody who was a partial expert on computers to ask for anopinion. You, too, wanted reassurance and conﬁdence about thepurchase you were making—that the money you were about toexchange for a computer was going to be spent wisely. The sameholds true when you buy anything of value. You just want reas-surance. If, however, you can trust the sales organization as theexperts, then you won’t need any outside expert opinion as theyoung student needed in the preceding example.
Even after you buy something, you often seek conﬁrmation
that your purchase was a good one. The late direct marketingconsultant Paul Bringe once wrote: “One of the ﬁrst things wedo after making a sizable purchase is to seek assurance from oth-ers that our decision was a good one. We tell our family, ourneighbors, our friends and our business associates and wait fortheir approval.”
One of the surprises I had while taking orders on our phone
lines at JS&A was the number of customers who stated somethinglike, “I bet that’s one of your best-selling products.” In manycases, it wasn’t. But in every case, whenever I mentioned that theproduct they had just purchased was indeed a very popular prod-uct, there was always a comment like, “I just knew that it was.”People need reassurance that they have made the right purchase.
9. Satisfaction Conviction
When you saw this heading, you might have thought we wouldbe talking about the trial period. Indeed, a trial period could bedeﬁned as a form of satisfaction conviction. “If you aren’t totallysatisﬁed with my product within one month, you may send it
143THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
======================================== [Página 168] ========================================

back for a full refund.” But that isn’t what we mean here. Sure,
every direct response offer should have a trial period. After all,the consumer needs to touch and feel a product to make a deci-sion about whether to keep it. So the trial period provides thebuyer with a level of conﬁdence. The consumer can change hisor her mind if it is not exactly what he or she is looking for.
But a satisfaction conviction is more than a trial period. It
basically conveys a message from you to your prospect thatsays, “Hey, I’m so convinced you will like this product that I’mgoing to do something for your beneﬁt to prove how incrediblemy offer is.”
If your potential customer, after reading what you are going
to do, says something like, “They must really believe in theirproduct,” or “How can they do it?” or “Are they going to getripped off by customers who will take advantage of their generos-ity?” then you know you’ve got a great example of a satisfactionconviction.
Let me give you an example. When I ﬁrst offered BluBlocker
sunglasses, I said in my TV advertising, “If you’re unhappy withBluBlockers, I’ll let you return them anytime you want. There isno trial period.” A lot of people thought to themselves, “Thatmust be a good product or otherwise they wouldn’t make that of-fer.” Or they may have said, “Boy, are they going to get rippedoff.” In either case, I conveyed a conviction that my customerwas going to be so satisﬁed that I was willing to do somethingthat is rarely done.
In one ad, I stated, “If you aren’t happy with your purchase,
just call me up and I’ll personally arrange to have it picked up atmy expense and refund you every penny of your purchase priceincluding the time you took to return the product.”
Testing a Satisfaction Conviction
Once I was able to test the power of a satisfaction conviction. Inan ad I wrote for the company called Consumers Hero, I was of-fering subscriptions to a discount bulletin showing refurbishedproducts at very low prices. But rather than just mail the bulletinto prospects, I formed a club and offered a subscription to the bul-letin. I tested various elements in the 700-word ad. I changed the
144UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 169] ========================================

headline and tested it and improved response by 20 percent. I
changed the price and saw little change in total response. The lowerthe price, however, the more orders I received. But when I changedjust the satisfaction conviction, the response rate doubled.
In one ad, I said, “If you don’t buy anything during your
two-year subscription, I’ll refund the unused portion of yoursubscription.”
In the second ad I stated, “But what if you never buy from
us and your two-year membership expires? Fine. Send us justyour membership card and we’ll fully refund your ﬁve dollarsplus send you interest on your money.”
In the ﬁrst ad, you see a basic, simple trial-period type of-
fer. In the second version, however, you see an offer that goeswell beyond the trial period and can be classiﬁed as a satisfac-tion conviction.
In the test, the response doubled even though the satisfac-
tion conviction was at the very end of the ad. This meant thatpeople read the entire ad and then, at the very end when thatimportant buying decision had to be made, the satisfactionconviction removed any remaining resistance to buying intothe concept.
If you have gotten the reader into the slippery slide and all
the way to the end of an ad, it’s that last part of the ad whereyou’ve got an awful lot to do. Think about it. You’ve got to ex-plain the offer to the prospect, why it’s a good offer and why heor she should buy the product, and then you’ve got to do some-thing dramatic to push him or her over the edge—all within thevery last part of your sales message. It’s like a salesperson ask-ing for the order and then also saying, “And if you buy this fromme now, I will do something that few salespeople would do toensure your satisfaction.”
The right satisfaction conviction is important, too. The ideal
satisfaction conviction should raise an objection and resolve it, as I’ve indicated in the previous chapter, but in resolving it, gobeyond what people expect.
It was effective in my Consumers Hero ad because it tied
perfectly into resolving any last-minute resistance. First itraised the objection—“What if I don’t buy from your bulletin
145THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
======================================== [Página 170] ========================================

over a two-year period?” And then I resolved it with a satis-
faction conviction—something that went beyond what peopleexpected.
But be careful to use a satisfaction conviction that makes
sense for the offer. You wouldn’t want to raise an objection andthen satisfy it with the wrong resolution. Make sure any objec-tion is indeed satisﬁed by the correct resolution. In short, it’s gotto make sense.
The satisfaction conviction is a critical part of the sales
message and few realize its importance. Yet, if you can create apowerful satisfaction conviction, this simple device will do agreat deal for the success of your offers. 
10. Nature of Product
This is one of the really important keys in determining how tosell a product. First, you have to realize that every product has itsown unique personality, its own unique nature, and it’s up to youto ﬁgure it out.
How do you present the drama of that product? Every prod-
uct has one very powerful way of presenting itself that will ex-press the true advantages and emotion that the product has tooffer and motivate the largest number of people to buy it. 
Remember the Midex burglar alarm that I sold for many
years through full-page ads in national magazines? What was thenature of that product and how could I motivate people to buy it?I explained that in Chapter 2.
I used the security system as an example of the nature of
products. This was an unusual product because it had a uniquepersonality. The product category itself had its own proﬁle. Byrealizing the nature of every product and playing to its strengths,you will end up with a very powerful and emotionally dramaticpresentation.
Think about other examples. What is the nature of a toy?
It’s a fun game. So you bring out the enjoyment. What is the na-ture of a blood pressure unit? It’s a serious medical device thatyou use to check your blood pressure. Note the word serious .
What is the nature of a burglar alarm? It’s a serious product that
146UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 171] ========================================

should be easy to install, work when it is supposed to and provide
protection to concerned homeowners. Very often, common sense isall you need to understand and appreciate the nature of a product.
Realize that you must understand the nature of the product
you are selling or you won’t effectively sell it.
11. Prospect Nature
In selling, it is important to understand not only the nature of theproduct you are offering but the nature of your prospect as well.When I was in college and thinking about joining a fraternity, Ihad an experience that really points out the value of understand-ing this very important trigger.
Of all the fraternities I could have joined in college, I chose
the worst one. Why? After spending time visiting various frater-nities, I had ﬁgured out the nature of why guys join a fraternityin the ﬁrst place.
I reasoned that with this knowledge, I could single-handedly
take the worst fraternity on campus and turn it into the best one,simply by coming up with an effective marketing plan to dra-matically increase membership. My approach would take intoaccount the nature of my prospect (the student) and, using thisinformation, seduce that student into wanting to join my frater-nity at the exclusion of all others. I would thus, by building alarge membership, transform my fraternity into a top-rated orga-nization, regardless of how bad it had been when I joined. Thismay seem like a rather naive plan, but I was convinced that I per-sonally could make a difference.
After joining and going through the initiation period, I got
sworn in, went before my fraternity brothers, and laid out myplan—“Operation Survival” as I called it. I explained that guysjoin a fraternity for two psychological and motivating factors:One was as a vehicle to meet girls and the other was to experi-ence the camaraderie and brotherhood of a group of guys. Ishowed that an illusion could be created to capture this effect ofsocial interaction in a fraternity for the sake of acquiring newmembers or pledges. The goal was to have more guys wanting tojoin our fraternity than any other on campus. And we needed this
147THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
======================================== [Página 172] ========================================

big infusion of new faces or our fraternity would surely die—
that’s how bad this place was and how badly we were doing at-tracting new members. It truly was Operation Survival.
My plan was simple and consisted of two parts. The ﬁrst
part was to invite the most beautiful and sexy girls to act as host-esses for our get-acquainted events. I didn’t want the activebrothers’ girlfriends to act as hostesses as was usually the case.No, these gals had to be world-class—girls the guys would talkabout for days after our event.
The second was the way each brother had to introduce a fel-
low brother to a prospective member. I insisted that the brothershould say to a prospect something very loving and warm abouthis fellow fraternity brother. I said, “Put your arms around yourbrother and tell the prospect what a wonderful person your brotheris and how much you genuinely admire and love this guy.”
The plan was not as easy to execute as it might seem. First,
no world-class gal on campus wanted any part of my fraternity.Second, the guys hated each other, and expressing love about afellow brother whom you hated seemed a rather difﬁcult gesture,if not impossible. But I did a few things that made it work.
We hired four of the most beautiful strippers from the local
strip clubs. They were young, sexy, and welcomed the opportu-nity to assume roles as sexy university coeds and hostesses forour three planned get-acquainted parties. I then rehearsed theguys and made them put their arms around each other, express-ing this new brotherly love that was so foreign and repulsive tothem. They could barely stand it. But the charade worked.
Not only did we end up with the biggest pledge class in our
history, beating all the other fraternities, but some of the guys ac-tually got closer to their fellow brothers, and an entire new spiritspread throughout the fraternity. There was such a buzz aroundcampus about the girls who were acting as our hostesses that bythe time we held our third party, we didn’t have room for thecrowd that we attracted. In fact, the strippers enjoyed their expe-rience so much that they invited some of their beautiful girl-friends to join the fun. The guests were so impressed with thelove, brotherhood, and display of beautiful women that when itcame time to join, they were literally begging to sign up.
148UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 173] ========================================

I had understood the psychological trigger of my product
(the fraternity) and of my prospect (the young man looking for aplace to ﬁnd love and social interaction). The key in this casewas the power of knowing the nature of the prospect —those
emotional aspects of the prospect that would respond best to aplanned pitch. Operation Survival was a huge success and trans-formed my fraternity into one of the best on campus—all from asimple marketing plan and in a few short weeks.
Let me cite a few more examples to illustrate this very im-
portant principle. If I was selling a home, I would get to knowthe motivations of my prospects and what they are looking for ina home. I would ﬁnd out their history. I would ask them abouttheir other home-buying experiences and what their hobbies are.I would gather as much information about them as possible andthen I would develop a sense of what emotional needs theymight have.
Understanding their needs and the nature of the prospect in
general would give me enough information to craft a very effec-tive sales presentation that, ideally, would match the nature ofmy product with the nature of my prospect.
The prospect has basic emotional needs that your product
or service will solve, regardless of how sophisticated or simpleyour product offering is. Examine those emotional needs. It isfrom the perspective of emotion that you will reach the coreessence of your prospect’s motivation. And it is from thisessence that you will get all the clues you need to uncover theway to that prospect’s heart and soul and eventually to his or herpocketbook.
12. Current Fads
There are always a number of fads taking place at the same time.One might be a clothing fad, another might be an unusual ex-pression made popular by a TV show or commercial, or a fadmight be a popular trend.
There are also fads in direct response. On TV right now, the
hottest products are exercise devices. There was a time when realestate shows were popular. Be aware of the current fads so you
149THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
======================================== [Página 174] ========================================

can determine the hottest product categories and also the new lan-
guage of our time. You want to recognize them and harmonizewith them.
A good example of recognizing fads and knowing what to
do with them comes from an experience I had with Richard Guil-foyle, a direct marketer from Boston. He had a strong sense ofhistory and prided himself on creating replicas of historic Ameri-can objects—Paul Revere’s lantern, a statue of George Washing-ton at Valley Forge, a salt and pepper set from the time of theRevolutionary War. In 1975 his company was doing quite well.
And no wonder. The country was about to celebrate its bi-
centennial anniversary, and this class of merchandise was beingrecognized as a way of celebrating the birth of our nation 200years before. Sales were brisk. Richard was capitalizing on thiscurrent fad for American Revolutionary period products.
Then the bottom of his business fell out. Sales plummeted
and he couldn’t ﬁgure out why. And it all happened just prior toJuly 4th, 1976—the date of the bicentennial celebration.
When he attended my seminar, he was really quite disap-
pointed with his business. What happened? I suggested thatmaybe it was because people were associating his merchandisewith the anniversary of the United States. Since that date had al-ready passed, his sales reﬂected this perception. 
But Richard insisted that this wasn’t the case. “My products
have true historic signiﬁcance and have nothing to do with thebicentennial.” Could I simply look at his copy and help him im-prove it?
After looking over his copy, which was actually quite good,
I saw clearly what the problem was. He had not recognized thatconsumers perceived his products as part of the excitement ofthe bicentennial and not as a part of American history that theycould save and own.
He then showed me a few ads he had prepared as a result
of attending my seminar. One of them was for a necklace witha small replica of a Paul Revere lantern that had a diamond inthe center representing the light. It was a beautiful piece ofjewelry.
150UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 175] ========================================

I read the copy and said, “You have a winner here. This ad
will do well—not because of the historic nature of the necklacebut because of the beautiful piece of jewelry that it is. You’renow selling jewelry, Richard, not good old Americana.”
Sure enough, the ad was a huge success and he soon real-
ized how a powerful fad can grow and fade.
Fads Generate Publicity
I used fads as a way of generating publicity when I was doingpublic relations for a few of my clients. One owned a ski resortand was trying to increase the awareness of snowmobiles at hisresort. At the time, during the mid to late 1960s, the women’s libmovement was new, strong and vocal. I suggested that the resortowner ban women snowmobile drivers and issue a press releaseproudly announcing the fact. He did and the publicity went na-tional. He rescinded his ban and snowmobile sales grew dramat-ically from the national publicity and attention. 
At the same time, one of my accounts—Jerry Herman,
owner of the Spot pizza restaurant near Northwestern Universityin Evanston, Illinois—wanted national publicity, too. Womenwere in the middle of an unusual fad—throwing their bras awayand going braless. I suggested to Jerry that he design a bra-shaped pizza and he, too, got national publicity. While thesepublicity stunts might seem a bit silly in retrospect, back thenthey were effective because they tied into a fad of the times.
A fad can die just as quickly as it can grow. So you must
capture the moment early enough and get out right after the fadpeaks. The people who came out with radar detectors when theybecame a fad did exceptionally well. A few of them attended myseminar and wrote great ads and built their companies into verysuccessful entities. 
One of the companies selling radar detectors—Cincinnati
Microwave—sent three of their top people to my seminar beforeit really took off and became a $140 million company with over$40 million in proﬁts. 
But be careful. I can tell you stories (I should say night-
mares) that show how dangerous fads can be to your ﬁnancialhealth. During the Watergate scandal, I once introduced “The
151THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
======================================== [Página 176] ========================================

Watergate Game—a game of intrigue and deception for the
whole family.” But no store would carry it because of the contro-versy and I lost my shirt. I once created the Batman credit card tocapture the Batman fad of the 1960s and printed 250,000 of themonly to be denied a license to sell them.
But as you can see, knowing how to recognize a fad and
capitalize on it can be a very powerful tool if your timing isright. This brings us very nicely to the next topic.
13. Timing
How many times have you been too early with an idea or toolate? I’ve heard complaints from many of my students who havefailed because their timing just wasn’t right.
Timing certainly has a lot to do with fads. You want to be
involved at the beginning of a fad and not enter in the middle orthe end. That’s smart timing. But there are products that havejust been introduced too early or too late, and that relates to tim-ing, too. When do you introduce a new product? Is Americaready for it? And how do you know?
The answer really is quite simple: Nobody knows. That’s
why I always test every product that I sell ﬁrst. The consumerwill tell me if I’m too early or too late or right on target.
When crime increased, it was good common sense to of-
fer burglar alarms. When the O.J. Simpson case unraveled,there were plenty of opportunities to capitalize on it and themedia sure did.
President Carter went on television in 1980 and repri-
manded Americans, accusing us of running up too much debt.“Stop using your credit cards” was his suggestion. And millionsof Americans did just that. Direct response rates plummetedovernight. Tests we had previously run that showed greatpromise were coming up as losses. Our timing obviously wasbad but through no fault of ours. Knowing the cause of the prob-lem helped us keep our sanity.
It’s just as important to know when the timing is bad. We
came out with a product called the Bone Fone, a portable radioworn around the neck. It was perfect timing until a product
152UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 177] ========================================

called the Walkman came out and killed our new product. Tim-
ing. It can kill a product or make it.
I once ran a media test on an electronic blood pressure unit
we were thinking of putting in our catalog. I thought it would dowell and when the results were presented to me, I was amazed athow well it had done. Armed with a great deal of conﬁdence, Iplaced a major national advertising campaign in all the maga-zines we normally advertised in—spending almost $300,000 atthe time. But even before the ads started to run I discovered that the report I thought was so good was actually produced inerror. The product did not do well in the media test and in factdid quite poorly.
Since I had already placed the advertising, I braced myself
for the bad response. But my timing proved to be coincidentallyright on target. About the same time as the ads started to run, theAmerican Heart Association started running a major advertisingcampaign suggesting that Americans take their blood pressureregularly. Our sales jumped and what was destined to becomeone of our biggest losses turned into a nice proﬁt. And we evenwon the Life Extension Award from the Life Extension Associa-tion for our work in alerting the public to the need for measuringtheir blood pressure regularly.
14. Linking
A very critical technique that I have used in mail order ads is aprocess called linking. Basically, it is the technique of relatingwhat the consumer already knows and understands with whatyou are selling to make the new product easy to understandand relate to.
One of the easiest ways to explain this trigger is to describe
how it works in a fad—a craze that captures the public’s con-sciousness and quickly creates strong demand, awareness or be-havioral changes. The demand can be for a product such as forthe Beanie Babies in the 1990s or the citizens band (CB) radiosback in the 1970s. It can be simply the strong awareness of anew or different product or concept, such as the Viagra introduc-tion in 1998, or it can be for behavioral changes, such as women
153THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
======================================== [Página 178] ========================================

throwing away their bras during the women’s liberation move-
ment of the late 1960s.
There are also fads within speciﬁc industries. For example,
in the exercise industry there might be a fad for abdominal de-vices; on infomercials, there might be a glut of business opportu-nity shows.
Usually the fads come and go quickly. But the importance
of the fad examples is to show you the process of linking on itsmost basic and obvious levels. Then I’ll take it deeper to giveyou a sense of how linking can be used to effectively sell anyproduct or service.
For example, I used the awareness of a presidential act as a
way of selling products. When it was discovered in 1973 thatNixon was using phone tap equipment to record all his phoneconversations, there was enormous publicity about it. I immedi-ately put together a JS&A offer for a system with which anybodycould tap their phones and ran it in the Wall Street Journal under
the headline “Tap Your Phone.”
That ad was a mistake. The FBI showed up at my door and
the Wall Street Journal threatened not to run my ads any more.
Even worse, I didn’t sell many of the systems and lost money onthe ad. You see, what Nixon did was illegal and so my offer encour-aged illegal activity even though I had done nothing illegal myself.
In contrast, I caught another fad at just the right time. I of-
fered a walkie-talkie right at the height of the citizens band (CB)radio boom in the United States. By calling my walkie-talkie aPocket CB because it broadcast on one of the CB frequencies, Iwas able to capture a major chunk of the CB market.
The minute there is a lot of publicity about something and it
has the potential to turn into a fad, you could have a great oppor-tunity to link it onto something that you’re doing either to getpublicity or to promote a product.
Fads are very powerful. And you now understand the basic
concept of linking. But how does this help you as a copywriter?
Whenever I sell a new product or a unique feature of a new
concept, I use linking. I take what is familiar to the prospect, re-late it to the object I am selling, and create a bridge in the mind
154UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 179] ========================================

of my prospect. Because of this linking, the prospect needs to
think a lot less to understand the new product. The product iseasier to relate to the needs of the prospect. Everybody wins.
Linking a Body Part
My ad for a smoke detector was an example of this process.The headline read: “The Nose.” I talked about the smoke de-tector not as a smoke detector (many such devices were al-ready being sold) but as a nose that sat on your ceiling andsniffed the air. When it smelled smoke, it set off an alarm. Itook the very human and simple concept of a nose—a part ofthe body whose function is well understood—and then linkedit to an electronic device.
In the ad I also used linking to express quality. For exam-
ple, I talked about the integrated circuits using gold for the con-tact points. My prospect was then able to link the expense andquality of gold to this product to arrive at a quality link and jus-tify its higher price. In actuality, every integrated circuit usedgold for its contact points, so this wasn’t revolutionary, but no-body had taken the time to explain it to the consumer.
I have used linking in many other ways. For example, I
had a product that was a remote car starter. You pressed a but-ton on a remote control device and your car automaticallystarted. I called it “The Maﬁa Auto Gadget.” Can you see thelinkage with this product? No? Well, I explained it in the ad.The Maﬁa often used explosives activated by a car’s ignitionto eliminate competition. Because this device started the carfor you at a distance, it eliminated the fear and concern for anyMaﬁa member. Of course, the market was also broadened toinclude those people who simply liked the convenience ofprestarting their cars on hot or cold days and having the carsreach a pleasant temperature before they got in. But the posi-tioning of the product was done with a link that the consumercould understand—the Maﬁa.
Today, such a device might be linked to the terrorist car
bombings in Iraq or a threat to homeland security—both strongbut unpleasant trends. I doubt the product would be popular to-day, not to mention the poor association this link would make.
155THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
======================================== [Página 180] ========================================

This is also a perfect example of why it often doesn’t pay to
copy a successful campaign of the past. But that is another issue.
I could give you many examples. The main point to remem-
ber about linking, though, is that it should relate the product orservice you are selling to something that is easy for yourprospect to identify with so that you bridge the mental gap in themind of the prospect.
Usually products are simply improved versions of previ-
ously sold products. You need to relate the older product to thenew version to explain the differences.
One of the hardest things to use linking for is a miracle
product—a product that is too good to believe. For example, Iwas selling a pill to be put in the gas tank of your car; it wouldimprove gas mileage and clean out the engine, and had 10 timesthe fuel additives of super unleaded fuel. It was truly an amazingproduct and difﬁcult to link to anything that existed in the mar-ketplace. We used the phrases “vitamins for your car” and“tuneup in a pill” as a few of our links.
Linking is a basic human emotional system of storing expe-
riences and knowledge and then recalling those experiences andlinking them to something we have to deal with on a daily basisor that is in the public’s consciousness. We often link. WhenPresident John F. Kennedy died, I was in the military in Frank-furt, Germany, and his assassination took place in the eveningFrankfurt time. I remember where I was at that precise momentand remember the confusion and the personal pain I felt. I linkedevery image and emotion to that moment in time. Do you re-member where you were when you ﬁrst found out about the at-tacks on September 11th?
15. Consistency
As a direct marketer, I have determined that the most importantthing you can do to turn a prospect into a customer is to make itincredibly easy for that prospect to commit to a purchase, re-gardless of how small that purchase may be. It is therefore im-perative that the commitment be simple, small, and in line withthe prospect’s needs.
156UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 181] ========================================

Once the commitment is made and the prospect becomes a
customer, the playing ﬁeld suddenly changes. There now exists alevel of commitment and consistency, directed in your favor, toencourage future purchases.
A good example of this can be seen at a car dealership. The
salesperson tallies your purchase, gets approval from the generalmanager, and then has you sign the paperwork. As she is walkingaway to get the car prepped and ready for you to drive away, sheturns to you and says, “And you do want that undercoating,don’t you?” You instinctively nod your head. The charge isadded to your invoice. “And you’ll also want our ﬂoor mats tokeep your car clean as well, won’t you?”
Or how about the times when you order something from a
catalog and say to yourself, “Since I’m going through the troubleor ordering, let’s see what else they have that I might like,” andyou end up ordering more.
Once a commitment is made, the tendency is to act consis-
tently with that commitment. The customer nods his head.
A good example of this phenomenon was told to me by Jon
Spoelstra, the former general manager of the Portland Trailblaz-ers basketball team and president of the New Jersey Nets. One ofhis primary jobs was to sell tickets. “I would personally visit aprospect, sell him a simple yet basic ticket package, start toleave, and then turn around just as I was about to walk out thedoor and offer something else. Very often my customer wouldsimply nod his head and say under his breath, ‘Yeah, sure, addthat to it, too.’”
One of the important points to remember is to always make
that ﬁrst sale simple. Once the prospect makes the commitmentto purchase from you, you can then easily offer more to increaseyour sales. This is equally true for products sold from a mail or-der ad or from a TV infomercial. I have learned to keep the ini-tial offer extremely simple. Then, once the prospect calls andorders the product I am offering, and while the prospect is on thephone, I offer other items and end up with a larger total sale. Anadditional sale occurs over 50 percent of the time, depending onmy added offer.
Once you’ve committed to the original purchase, you are
157THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
======================================== [Página 182] ========================================

poised for a course of action consistent with what you have al-
ready undertaken. In the case of buying, you are now primed tobuy more by virtue of the original commitment to buy.
16. Harmonize
An important lesson I taught at the seminar was learned from thestory of how the late Bobby Darin, a popular singer of the 1950sand 1960s, became famous.
As a young singer in New York, for a long time Darin
tried unsuccessfully to break into the music business. Hewould go from record company to record company trying toconvince them to make an album of him singing old popularstandards.
He was rejected. Nobody believed that the music industry
would accept old popular songs from an unknown young singer.Besides, the hot music at the time was good old rock and rollsung by black artists and called the Motown sound.
Darin was quite frustrated, so he took things into his own
hands. Did he cut his own album by himself? No, he didn’t havethe money. Did he convince a record company to record him?Yes, but not the songs he so desperately wanted to record. In-stead he sat down and wrote a tune that ﬁtted or harmonized withwhat the public was buying at the time.
The tune he wrote was called “Splish Splash,” and the
lyrics started out, “Splish splash, I was takin’ a bath, ‘roundabout a Saturday night.” It went on to tell a story about whathappened when he took that bath. The song was good old Mo-town rock and roll and he easily sold this music to a record com-pany, which recorded it with Darin singing the lead. “SplishSplash” became a smash hit and sold millions of records. In therecording, he even sounded like a Motown recording artist.
Darin recognized what the market wanted and was buying
at the time, and he created something that harmonized perfectlywith that market, even though his song was far from the musicthat was in his heart. He made the practical choice to put asidehis desires, put aside his ego and goals, and just cut a record that
158UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 183] ========================================

would sell and earn him the recognition he needed to record the
type of music he really wanted to record.
Despite the hit record, which became a million seller, he
still couldn’t interest any record company in recording him for apop album. So he took all his earnings from the success of“Splish Splash” and made the album himself. One of the songshe recorded was his version of an old Kurt Weill song called“Mack the Knife.” Not only was his album a smash hit, but“Mack the Knife” became a multimillion-selling single through-out the world. Bobby Darin went on to be known not for “SplishSplash” but for the music he loved best—popular jazz oldies.
Lessons from Bobby Darin
There are many lessons to be learned from this one example.First, realize that often you must go with the established wayof doing things in order to accomplish your goals. You’ve gotto pattern yourself after what is working and then harmonizewith the marketplace. Once you have an established reputa-tion, it’s easier to try something different that you yourselfwant to do.
So ﬁrst you meet the needs of the market to raise the capital
youneed and then you go for your dreams. Once you’ve raised
your own funds, you can do anything you want. You can pursuea course of action that nobody else would believe possible.
I also use the Bobby Darin example to convince people
who come to me with a concept or idea that seems really too farout of the mainstream that they have to harmonize with the mar-ketplace. In some cases, their product needs a slightly differenttwist to work, even though that is not what they envisioned forthe product. The change usually involves removing a componentor making the product cheaper or presenting it in a totally newand simple way. Let me cite one perfect example.
It was 1973 and the president and national sales manager of
a calculator company, APF, came to me with their new product.They were all excited about it and felt that they had the greatestand most exciting breakthrough in electronics since the calcula-tor was invented.
159THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
======================================== [Página 184] ========================================

So conﬁdent were they that they were willing to pay for the
cost of my test ad. “Joe, this product is so hot that you’ll sell mil-lions,” said the president of the company.
At the time, prices were still quite high for calculators, so
$69.95 was a very attractive price back then for a good desk cal-culator with a large display. APF had sold their calculators suc-cessfully at $69.95 but felt that with their latest innovation, theyhad the ultimate product for my company—truly a revolution inelectronics (or so they thought).
“What’s the innovation?” I asked. The company president
and his national sales manager unwrapped a special box to showme their prototype.
The calculator was the same calculator they had been sell-
ing for the past year but with a new feature—a clock that ran inthe calculator display when the calculator wasn’t being used.“What do you think?” the president beamed. “We plan on sellingthis for $99.95.”
I didn’t like the idea. I explained that the consumer felt that
a calculator was a serious business tool, turned on when it wasneeded and turned it off when it was not. I had been selling themfor almost two years and had a pretty good sense of the productand its emotional appeal. Putting a clock into the display andkeeping the calculator on all the time was not in harmony withwhat would impress the consumer and therefore it would not besuccessful. Increasing the price was a mistake. If I had a choice,I would have offered the product for less, or about $39.95, in or-der to get rid of their inventory. I just felt that it wouldn’t sell.
The company president didn’t believe me. “What?” he blurted
out. “It costs more to make than the standard model and it’s so rev-olutionary—why should we even consider selling it for less?”
I agreed to write an ad to prove my point. “I will write a
great ad and let you approve it. I will then run the ad in the Wall
Street Journal . We’ll measure the response and if it’s successful,
we’ll create a nice advertising campaign for you.”
I sent APF the ad and they loved it. “If this doesn’t work,
I’m getting out of the calculator business,” said the president.And so I ran the ad.
It failed miserably. The product was closed out at $39.95
160UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 185] ========================================

shortly thereafter. When you are not in harmony with the market,
the marketplace doesn’t respond. Taking a product and making itharmonize with the prospect is simply a matter of good listeningand observation. It doesn’t take genius. It takes a good eye andear, and a little intuition helps, too.
It is important that your product harmonize with or ﬁll the
needs of your prospect. If it doesn’t, it is up to you to ﬁgure outhow to change it so it does. It might mean showing it in a differ-ent color, removing or adding an accessory—the point is that thecustomer is the king. Your goal is to harmonize not only with themarketplace but in particular with your customer.
17. Desire to Belong
The desire to belong is a strong motivational factor in marketingbut it is often not appreciated. Think about it.
Why do people own a Mercedes? Why do they smoke
Marlboro cigarettes? Why do certain fads catch on? It could bethat these people buy a speciﬁc product because they subcon-sciously want to belong to the group that already owns or usesthat speciﬁc product.
In the case of Marlboros, the smokers subconsciously want
to join that group of smokers who have responded to the ruggedwestern image the cigarette’s ad agency has created.
The people who buy a Mercedes often want to belong to
that special group of Mercedes owners. Do you think it’s be-cause of the special braking or suspension system? Forget it.They’re going out and spending megabucks to buy somethingthat’s maybe slightly better than many of the other automobiles.The other cars can take you to the same places at the same speedand yet these people—all very intelligent—will go out andspend plenty more to buy a Mercedes. 
And the list goes on. You name a product that has an estab-
lished image and I’ll show you a consumer who, somewhere inhis or her subconscious value system, wants to belong to thegroup of people who own that product. Fashion, automobiles,cigarettes, gadgets, whatever the category—the consumer whobuys a speciﬁc brand has been motivated to buy that brand by
161THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
======================================== [Página 186] ========================================

virtue of the desire to belong to the group of people who already
own that brand.
When V olvo discovered that its customer base had one of
the highest educational levels of any of the car manufacturers,they publicized this fact. They then noticed that when the samesurvey was conducted a few years later, the percentage jumpedeven higher. The increase was caused, in my judgment, by the as-sociation that other highly educated new buyers wanted to makewith the V olvo owners—they wanted to belong to that group.
Some students have said to me, “Well, what about hermits?
Don’t tell me they have the desire to belong.”
And my answer has been that they want to belong to the
group of people who are hermits. To identify with the groupdoesn’t necessarily mean you have to be with anyone or be verysocial. And maybe the key word here is identify . The Mercedes
owner wants to be identiﬁed with the class or group of peoplewho also own a Mercedes.
Owning a Rolls-Royce in California in the 1970s was the ul-
timate status symbol. I couldn’t believe how impressed peoplewere with other people who owned one. Being a Midwestern boyand not having grown up on the car-conscious West Coast, it wasculture shock to realize how much a Rolls meant to somebodyfrom the West Coast. Yet when you look at the car, it is one of themost conservative and old-fashioned-looking automobiles on theroad today.
The desire to belong to and identify with a group of people
who own a speciﬁc product is one of the most powerful psycho-logical motivators to be aware of in marketing and copywriting.But one of the best examples I can give was a personal experi-ence, which leads me to my next psychological point.
18. Desire to Collect
There must be a natural instinct in the human race to collect, as Ilearned from my marketing experience.
If you are selling a collectible, it’s pretty easy to understand
that this urge exists and therefore, as a direct marketer, you need
162UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 187] ========================================

to capitalize on it. But often overlooked is the fact that it can
be used to sell any other product, too. Let’s take the watchbuyer. An enthusiastic watch buyer is your perfect prospect foranother watch.
When I was selling watches in print, I would send mailings
to those customers who had previously ordered from me and of-fer them other watches. I received a great response. My best listfor watches consisted of my existing watch owners. Now youwould think that if you had a watch, what would you need an-other one for? Wrong. Many people actually collect them.They’ll have several watches, several pairs of sunglasses, sev-eral pairs of jeans, a library of videos or compact disks. The listis endless.
I’m always amazed at the number of dolls collected by
QVC viewers. Some of the viewers are older women, long pastchildhood, yet among QVC’s most avid collectors. And theyhave dozens of dolls.
Small car models are also sold on
QVC. They are some of the most popularproducts. And not to be outdone, theremust be thousands of viewers who ownmany BluBlocker sunglasses—often inseveral different styles.
The point is, when selling, whether
in print or on TV or the Internet, recog-nize that there is a very large segment ofthe population who, for whatever reason,has an emotional need to collect a seriesof similar products. These products bring great joy and satisfac-tion and in some cases utility.
And think about those who collect the real cars. Many who
can afford them have collections that range up to hundreds offull-sized automobiles. What kind of emotional need are they fulﬁlling?
One of the ways that direct marketers optimize on the col-
lecting instinct is by sending, free of charge with their very ﬁrstshipment, some sort of device to hold the collection.
I can remember ordering a series of silver airplane tails with
163THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
You’d be amazed
at what people
collect.
======================================== [Página 188] ========================================

various airline logos embossed on them from the Franklin Mint. 
I started collecting them to see how the Franklin Mint conducted itsprogram rather than from any interest in collecting airplane tails.
I received a beautiful chest with cutouts for each of the sil-
ver tails. And they came once a month and each month I put onemore tail in the chest. I looked at my collection each time I put ina new tail and felt the pride of knowing that my tail collectionwas growing. Finally, I had enough to ﬁll the chest so that whenguests came over, I could display my entire tail collection. I ﬁ-nally sobered up and stopped collecting. It was costing me asmall fortune, and after all, the only reason I had started was for the research. And the collection was kind of silly to beginwith. The airlines were either merging, going out of business or changing their names so fast that even the Franklin Mintcouldn’t keep up.
But it was this experience that convinced me that there
were lots of opportunities for selling to collectors.
19. Curiosity
If I had to pick the one major psychological reason that makesdirect marketing so successful today, it would be curiosity. At re-tail, a customer can touch and experience the product ﬁrst-handand then decide. A mail order customer can’t do that. The prod-uct might look good and do exactly what the customer expects itto do, yet there is always that level of curiosity that makes theproduct attractive to the prospect. “What is that product reallylike?” might be the typical thought of a prospect.
When I sold BluBlocker sunglasses on TV , I deliberately
created an enormous amount of curiosity. I had my subjects—or-dinary people we would ﬁnd on the streets—try on a pair ofBluBlocker sunglasses. I would then videotape their reactions.Some of the reactions were great and when I presented them on TV , the viewers were wondering, “What was it like to lookthrough these glasses—that pair of sunglasses with the orangelenses that was making everybody go wild?” 
I didn’t take the TV camera and look through a pair. That
would have destroyed the curiosity and would not have given
164UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 189] ========================================

the true picture of what the sunglasses would do for you.
(Your brain adjusts to the color shift when you look throughthe lens, whereas the TV camera does not.) Instead, I en-hanced curiosity by not showing the view. The only way youcould look through them was to buy a pair. And buy the publicdid—almost 8 million pairs from a series of commercials thatran for six years.
Curiosity also works well with books. You can tease
prospects by telling them what they will ﬁnd out by reading yourbooks. In fact, the strongest motivating factor in selling books iscuriosity, followed only by notoriety and credibility.
Because a prospect can’t touch or experience the product, cu-
riosity is the strongest motivating factor in mail order. Immediategratiﬁcation is the strongest factor in retail. So if I recognize thatfact and can deliver your product promptly—let’s say withFedEx—I’m capitalizing on the curiosity in mail order and com-ing close to the retail advantage.
I’ve sold products relying completely on the factor of cu-
riosity. In 1973 I offered a pocket calculator without ever show-ing a picture of it. By creating such compelling curiosity aboutthat product, I sold thousands of them. Sure the price was goodand the product was great, but without showing the product oreven mentioning the brand name, I was still able to make theselling message very compelling.
How do you use curiosity in selling your products? First re-
alize that when you sell books, curiosity is the key motivatingfactor and you should use it as your prime selling tool. But real-ize also that there are many other products that lend themselvesto holding back part of the story in order to arouse curiosity andcreate a demand.
Show too much, tell too much, and you run the risk of
killing whatever advantage you have using mail order as amedium. 
A friend of mine, Steve Dworman, who publishes an info-
mercial trade newsletter, was fascinated by my success using cu-riosity as the main selling tool in my BluBlocker commercial.He thought to himself, “Could the same technique be used to sellsomething that was impossible to sell on TV in a direct response
165THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
======================================== [Página 190] ========================================

commercial? Like perfume?” So he organized the shooting of a
commercial using curiosity as its main motivating factor.
In the commercial, everybody was raving about the per-
fume but there was no way the TV sets allowed viewers to sniffit unless they bought Steve’s product. The commercial generatedenough curiosity to work.
How many times have you said too much, shown too much
or failed to use the power of curiosity? It is one of the leadingmotivating factors in all direct response marketing.
20. Sense of Urgency
You might have already ﬁgured this one out. You’ve almost soldthe prospect. The prospect believes in your product and is readyto buy. But like many of your customers, this one says, “Well, letme think about it.”
It is a proven fact that when this happens, chances are the
prospect won’t buy. And the reasons are really very logical. First,in time that excellent sales message you wrote will most likely beforgotten. Second, if you’re lucky and it isn’t forgotten, it won’thave the same impact it had when it was ﬁrst read. That old say-ing, “Out of sight, out of mind,” holds true in a case like this.
Therefore, to avoid the delaying tactic, you’ve got to pro-
vide prospects with an incentive or reason to buy now. In fact, ifyou do your job right, customers have to feel guilty if they don’tbuy right now. But how do you do it?
First, here’s what you don’t want to do. The prospect has
spent a lot of time with your ad and you’ve convinced him or herto buy. The one thing you don’t want to do is blow your integrityat the very end of the ad by making a statement that is not true. Astatement like, “If you don’t respond within the next few days,we’ll be sold out,” or some other deceit will turn off theprospect. So be careful. Whatever you say at the end should bethe truth and should be crafted to maintain the same integritythat has been expressed throughout your ad.
Now, what can you do to provide a sense of urgency? Some
ads reek with a sense of urgency and nothing has to be said. For
166UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 191] ========================================

example, I once ran a retraction for an ad that said that the price
listed for a calculator was the wrong price and that the new pricewas $20 higher, but you had a few days to purchase the productat the old price before the new price went into effect. That ap-proach was an integral part of the concept and provided a senseof urgency that was obvious and very real.
You can also convey a sense of urgency by offering limited
editions. “We have only 1,000 sets and this will be our last ad-vertisement” can be persuasive and motivate the buyer to actright away.
You might have a great ad with a good sense of urgency but
a fatal error might still kill your ad’s effectiveness. What is thatfatal error? Omitting important information that the buyer needsin order to make that buying decision. Then the buyer has the ex-cuse, “There’s a question I have but I’m too busy to call and ﬁndout the answer,” or a similar reason. In short, even a great senseof urgency can be wasted if you leave out some critical informa-tion from your ad copy.
You can use the sense of urgency in many different ways—
low supplies, closeout opportunity, price rise, product shortages,limited-time price opportunity or limited-edition opportunity.How about “Buy now so you can start enjoying the beneﬁts ofmy product tomorrow.” Or even “Buy one during the next threedays and you’ll get a second one free.”
Another way to provide a sense of urgency is through your
shipping methods. “We’ll ship your purchase via FedEx if youorder by (a certain date).” Or “Since you are one of our cus-tomers, you can buy this wonderful product prior to our nationalintroduction if you order by (a certain date).”
We used to run all our new product introductions with the
phrase, “National Introductory Price.” This didn’t mean thatmuch but it raised the possibility that the price was the introduc-tory price and later might go up. In actuality, the prices of calcu-lators and electronics always went down, so we eventuallydropped that phrase.
The number of possibilities is limited only by your imagi-
nation. The sense-of-urgency statements always go at the end ofyour advertising. And if there are two critical locations in your
167THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
======================================== [Página 192] ========================================

advertising, they are the very beginning and the very end. And it
is at the end where the sense of urgency and several other impor-tant concepts meet and must be considered and blended seam-lessly together.
21. Fear
Fear is one of the great motivators that will cause us to take ac-tion. Give a person a reason to act based on the fact that theymay lose the opportunity to buy something and they will usuallyact in a positive way toward your offer. As just discussed, senseof urgency is an important psychological trigger.
A part of the sense of urgency is based on fear. Your cus-
tomer fears that he or she will lose out on the opportunity of buy-ing a product or service because it won’t be available in thefuture or it won’t be available at the same price. But fear can be amotivating factor in other situations as well.
For example, when a new ﬂu virus or strain threatens, this
would be an opportunity to sell products that build the immunesystem or products that may help prevent the disease. People arebuying these products because they want to protect themselvesfrom the virus, which today is a real and present danger. Theyfear the consequences if they don’t buy something to protectthemselves. Even though it is easier to sell something that curesa disease than it is to sell a preventive, this rule is often violatedwhen fear is a major factor.
Fear of Crime
Another example is the purchase of a burglar alarm or even agun. There might be an outbreak of crime in a certain city andresidents who are fearful they might be attacked or robbed willtake action to protect themselves and their homes.
There are products that play to our fear of aging. Creams,
lotions and pills offering a fountain of youth are bought becausepeople fear the aging process and are concerned about what oth-ers think of their looks.
It is common to hear of people who take action and show ir-
rational behavior based on their fears. The stock market is a
168UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 193] ========================================

good example of irrational behavior when it comes to a person’s
fear of losing money. When the market crashes and is near thebottom of what is called a bear cycle and the economy looks ex-tremely grim, consumers start dumping stocks fearing that themarket will continue to collapse and they will lose more money.In reality, this usually is the best time to buy stocks. Or when theviability of the dollar is questioned, many investors, out of fear,protect themselves and buy gold coins or hoard cash.
Fear can be a great motivator if used carefully in response
to some perceived danger or loss that one might have to face.
22. Instant Gratiﬁcation
This is a big advantage at retail. Think about it. At retail, youpick something up, hold it, touch it and look it over completely.You can make your decision to buy and then you can take ithome with you where you can enjoy and use it immediately. Youdon’t have that advantage in mail order.
So to compensate, you should convey to your customer ei-
ther the advantages in ordering from you via mail or the assur-ance that you ship promptly and that the customer will have hisor her purchase within a few days.
The effort by direct marketers to provide that instant gratiﬁ-
cation—shipping promptly—has made mail order one of thefastest methods of distribution in the United States and has thustaken a great deal away from the retail industry. I can call a com-puter mail order company and order a piece of software on Mon-day morning and use it by Monday evening. That’s so mucheasier than running to the store, parking, ﬁnding the right depart-ment and then having to deal with the salesclerk. It’s no wonderdirect marketing has taken a dramatic bite out of many of the tra-ditional retail categories.
The mail order computer industry created giants such as
Dell Inc. and Gateway 2000 that specialize in next-day delivery.
And so if you have a product and want to capitalize on
the main advantage that a retailer has, ﬁnd a way to ship yourmerchandise out quicker, deliver it faster and provide better ser-vice than any retailer could ever offer.

23. Exclusivity, Rarity or Uniqueness
These are very strong motivating factors for the right product or
the right situation.
The concept is to basically let prospects feel that they are
special if they buy a particular product—that they will belong tothe very small group that can be envied for owning this very lim-ited item.
The emotional appeal of this approach is quite strong.
Everybody likes to feel special. Most people would like to be-long to a rare group that owns a product that few people canown and enjoy.
By limiting the number they produce, some marketing com-
panies have come up with a very strong appeal for consumers.The Franklin Mint—a multimillion-dollar business—was builton the premise of the limited edition, ﬁrst with coins and thenlater with everything from plates and cups to model cars anddolls. Anything you could collect and they could limit was fairgame for the Mint.
The thought behind the limited edition is also to provide
value. As people build various collections of things, the objectsgrow in value if others start collecting the same goods too. Soon,the collections come to the attention of the mass market and thatattracts more collectors. Then the value of the collections reallystarts to grow.
Those collectibles that have a limited circulation or a lim-
ited number in circulation grow in value even more. And there’salways the story of somebody discovering an heirloom in the at-tic worth a small fortune. There are exceptions, of course—silverairplane tails, to name one.
One of the appeals of an exclusive item is the possibility of
extra future value implied by limiting the circulation of thatproduct.
The power of exclusivity was driven home to me in Octo-
ber of 1980 when I was in Minocqua, Wisconsin. It was right af-ter I had given a seminar.
170UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 195] ========================================

At the seminar site, for the enjoyment of the participants, 
I kept a stable of six snowmobiles. Whenever I would give aseminar during the winter, I would have these machines avail-able for my students during their breaks. Riding snowmobileswas a lot of fun and everybody loved to drive them. Then oneday the president of Mattel Electronics, Jeff Rochlis, broke hisarm in a bad snowmobile accident. That ended our snowmobileprogram.
I now had six snowmobiles in my garage with not many
people to use them. Out of curiosity, one day I visited the localsnowmobile shop—the same place that had sold me the six that Iowned. I obviously didn’t need any more but I wanted to seewhat small improvements were added in the new models.
I walked into the shop and asked the salesman, “Well, Paul,
what’s new for this year?”
Paul took me over to a snowmobile that was propped up on
a small riser and pointed to it. “This baby is our new oil-cooledmodel that goes over 100 miles per hour and sells for $2,600.”
At the time, snowmobiles were selling for under $1,000 and
their top speed was around 40 miles per hour so this new modelwas obviously special. But regardless of how special it was, I al-ready had six and I certainly did not need any more. I turned toPaul and in a matter-of-fact way said, “Who could possibly wanta snowmobile that could go 100 miles per hour and cost $2,600?How ridiculous.”
Paul chuckled, “Well, there are only going to be six sold in
the entire state this year. We’ve been allocated only two of themand we already have one sold.”
I then quickly blurted out, “I’ll take this one.” Yes, I ended
up buying it. I wanted to be one of the few who owned thispowerful new machine. I wanted to feel that I was part of aunique group and that I was special. And even though I didn’tneed any more snowmobiles, I ended up buying it and I wasproud of the fact that I did.
It was this incident that made me realize the power of
exclusivity, uniqueness and rarity.

24. Simplicity
You must keep your advertising copy simple. The positioning of
your product must be simple. Your offer must be simple. In short, you want to keep your entire presentation as simple aspossible while still getting across your message.
There are times when you want to turn something simple
into something complex. We talked about that in the previouschapter under the topic “Product Explanation.” But that rule ap-plies to marketing issues, and here we are looking at the basicpsychological motivator of simplicity.
What does this mean in terms of your advertising copy? I
like to tell my students to focus. Focus on what you are trying to accomplish and eliminate things that either complicate yourpresentation or aren’t necessary.
This doesn’t mean you write copy that is so simple a third
grader can read it. That’s not what we mean by simple. The copyshould be able to be read by the less educated people as well asthe more educated and come across clearly. It is not good style towrite either “up” or “down” to anybody.
The use of big words to impress is one example of writing
up to somebody. You’re trying to impress with your use ofwords while somebody else who might not be familiar withyour fancy words will be lost. Use simple easy-to-understandwords. Words are, after all, stories—emotional images—eachhaving an impact sometimes greater than we think. Using sim-ple words has the greatest impact. Using words that everybodycan understand has a greater impact than words that most peo-ple have difﬁculty with.
And keep your layouts simple. Tests have conﬁrmed that
things like color bars across an ad, fancy type that is difﬁcult toread and lines that draw your eyes away from the copy can hurtcomprehension. Fancy typefaces may look good but they oftengive the lowest comprehension scores.
Simplicity Is a Powerful Tool
If you have a tendency to complicate things, you’re not going tosucceed in writing good direct response advertising copy. Beaware of this important point as you decide which typeface to
172UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 197] ========================================

use, how you want to present your product and the offer you
want to make.
A good example of how simplicity works in direct response
happened to me when Murray Raphel, a dear friend and a greatpublic speaker, approached me. He had been in touch with thepeople who had developed the Swiss Army watch and wonderedif I would be interested in marketing the product in the UnitedStates. Yes, I was. A meeting was arranged in which I was goingto see the line of watches. 
At the meeting I was presented with three styles and three
colors in each style for a total of nine different watches. Onewas a men’s style, the second was for women and the third wasfor children. The colors were black, red and khaki. I examinedthe watches, learned the history and in general became veryknowledgeable about the watches themselves. Then came thebig question.
“Mr. Sugarman, you’ve examined the watches. What do
you think?”
I looked over the watches, thought for a few minutes and
answered, “I’d like to run just the men’s watch in black in theWall Street Journal to test the concept.”
The watch company executives looked perplexed. “Why
don’t you offer all the styles? Look at how many more peopleyou’ll reach if you offer nine different styles. You’ll reachwomen and children in addition to men and you’ll give them alla color choice.”
I told them that in my experience, keeping it simple was the
best approach and that offering a customer too many choices wasa very dangerous thing to do.
But no matter what I said, they would not agree. “Logic
says, Mr. Sugarman, that offering more of a choice will result inmore sales.”
I then came up with an idea to prove that I was right. I of-
fered to run two separate ads in what is called an “A/B split.”That is where the Wall Street Journal will print two separate ver-
sions of the same ad—version A and version B—to be deliveredin the same area at the same time. So one home will get one ver-sion of the ad while the next-door neighbor might get version B.
173THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
======================================== [Página 198] ========================================

This was a very good way to test two different ads to
determine the winning approach.
I offered to do the test and ran the two ads with
almost identical copy and graphics. One of the fewdifferences was that in ad A, I showed the men’swatch along with the child’s watch for size perspec-tive, whereas in ad B, I showed just the men’s watch.I then listed each one of the choices—nine in all—inad A and just one in ad B.
When I ﬁnished the ads, the A version actually
looked better than the version with only one choice.When both versions ran, the ad that featured only onemen’s watch outpulled the other version that featurednine models by a surprising 3 to 1 ratio. In short, forevery watch we sold from the ad that featured the ninestyles, we sold three in the other ad that showed just
the one black watch.
I knew almost instinctively that to give the con-
sumer a confusing array of choices meant that theconsumer would back off and not buy.
When would I show all these nine watches?
Later, in my catalog. Once I’ve located those peopleinterested in Swiss Army watches, I would thenshow them all nine models in the catalog. By thetime the catalog reaches my customer, he or she hasbeen qualiﬁed as a watch buyer. I can now offer alarger selection.
Another good example of the power of simplicity
occurred during the production of a half-hour TVcommercial I was doing for a pill that reduced wrin-kles and improved the skin. Called Miracell, the prod-uct was truly revolutionary. I had been taking it for a
few months and noticed dramatic results. We did two double-blind studies that proved that the product really did work. Butthere was one major problem.
For maximum effectiveness, you had to take two pills a
day for the ﬁrst three months and then reduce the intake to onepill a day.
174UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
These two ads were
practically identicalwith ad A (top)offering ninedifferent modelsand ad B (bottom)offering only one.
======================================== [Página 199] ========================================

This violated my principles of simplicity and I was very
concerned that the consumer was going to be confused. Youmake it easy initially to buy a continuity product and then lateryou raise the price. For example, the ﬁrst video in a video seriesoffered on TV may cost only $5. It is a simple offer and it isn’tvery expensive. You then buy the video and to get the rest of theseries, you must pay $19.95 a month to receive a video eachmonth for the next 12 months.
I was going the opposite way. For the ﬁrst three months,
pills would cost double what they would cost during the fourthmonth and beyond. And here I was recommending taking twopills a day for three months and then one pill a day for the restof the time. Prospects might ﬁnd it really confusing and holdoff buying.
So I did two things to ensure the success of this show,
which we had already spent hundreds of thousands of dollarsto prepare. The ﬁrst was to have the host in the show verify the dosage and tell how the program worked even after I hadexplained it. We devoted almost three minutes to explain-ing the complicated offer in order to answer all anticipatedquestions.
But somehow I knew that the ﬁrst offer was too compli-
cated. And so I prepared an alternative offer just in case. For thesecond version I shot additional footage with just a simple offer:“Miracell costs $25 a box and a box lasts one month.” That wasit. It was very simple and very easy to understand. I knew that Iwould have to supply my customers with a double dose for theﬁrst three months, so three boxes would be at my own expense ifthis second version of the ad worked and the complicated ﬁrstversion did not.
Sure enough, after testing, the version that worked was
the simple one; it outpulled the ﬁrst one by a very large mar-gin. We ended up giving away an enormous amount of productin order to keep the offer simple and make the program simpleas well.
Simplicity in direct response is critical and quite necessary.
These are just two typical experiences from my many years ofdirect response marketing in various media.

======================================== [Página 200] ========================================

25. Human Relationships
It is always important to relate the product or service you are of-
fering in human terms. How the product will ﬁt, how it will feel,how it will look—these are just some of the ways you can relate.That may seem pretty obvious.
But there are other ways that copy or graphics can bring a
human element to an advertisement. And let’s look at why this isimportant.
Buying is an emotional human experience when we ex-
change our hard-earned money for a product or service. And be-cause we worked hard for that money, the act of buyingrepresents more than just handing over our money. Buyingsomething becomes an emotional event.
Resonating with Your Prospect
Now let’s consider for a moment a physical device—speciﬁcally atuning fork. I’m talking about the ones that look like a U-shapedpiece of metal. Clang one of the metal tines and you hear a vibra-tion. Take two tuning forks and if they are of the same frequencyand you hit just one, the other one will start vibrating even thoughit did not come into physical contact with the ﬁrst one.
Taking this experiment one step further, if you take several
tuning forks and put them together and hit them all, they willcreate a harmonic frequency all their own. And if you just hap-pen to know what that combined frequency is and have a tuningfork that matches that frequency, then, it too, will start to vibratein resonance with all the other tuning forks.
In creating a direct response advertisement, it is important
that you create a condition where your customer is in perfect har-monic resonance with your copy. We talked earlier in this bookabout getting the prospect to start nodding his or her head inagreement until the close. And the close becomes easier becausethe prospect is already nodding yes in agreement. It then becomeseasier to say yes when that ﬁnal question is posed: “May I haveyour order?”
If you look at all the elements of an advertisement as a se-
ries of tuning forks that must resonate with your reader, you’ve
176UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 201] ========================================

got a valuable picture of the dynamics that take place during the
selling process.
One tuning fork might be the headline, another might be
the picture, another might be the caption, and on to the ﬁrstsentence and through the copy to the ﬁnal offer. In a print ad,the vibrations must be conveyed through the elements in theadvertisement.
In order to create these positive vibrations, you ﬁrst must
interest the prospect in reading your copy and then you must re-ally “tune in” and relate to your prospect.
You can add a human element by relating a story in your
copy. Stories hold people’s interest. This technique is the nexttrigger discussed. Or you can use a byline and write copy in theﬁrst person using a conversational tone. This makes your copya more direct communication from one individual to another.Using humor in a light, inoffensive way will also develop a re-lationship with your prospect. The humor can relate a story in afolksy way as in my “Pet Plane” ad in Chapter 29 or it canbring out the “humanness” of the person marketing the productor service as I’ve done in my ad for the Magic Stat thermostatin Chapter 28.
Another approach is to use a picture of a human hand hold-
ing a small product. The hand adds size and perspective to whatis being presented and also adds that human element.
You can use attractive models. People like to relate to pretty
women or handsome men even though they may not themselvesbe attractive. In a subtle sense, they want to belong to the groupof people in the picture. Conversely, you don’t want to use a
picture of yourself if you think some of your readers may re-spond negatively to it. Especially if you look like a bearded vil-lain from some B-rated movie.
In short, in your advertising you want to use as many posi-
tive human elements as you can without risking any negative vi-brations from emotional reactions.
And if you do your job right, your advertisement will have
its own vibration—so much so that some people will be able topick up that vibration and feel that they almost know you.

======================================== [Página 202] ========================================

26. Storytelling
People love stories, and one of the re-
ally good ways to relate to yourprospect is to tell a story. Just as a pic-ture is worth a thousand words, a storycan be invaluable and often creates anemotional relationship or bond thatkeeps your prospect riveted and listen-ing. Stories create human interest. Inchildhood, stories read to us by ourparents were the way we fantasized oreven saw the world. In short, we’ve
been primed for stories ever since we were very young.
Think of the public speaker who starts his speech with a
story or uses stories throughout his presentation. It makes for aninteresting presentation and often holds the interest of the audi-ence. In fact, very often, after I’ve been listening to a boringspeaker and my mind starts to wander, I become alert when Iknow a story is about to be told.
Stories Have Lessons to Teach
Stories usually have lessons to teach or experiences to share oreven endings that can excite, surprise or bring out emotion. Andso it is with good copy. If you tell a story in your copy that is rel-evant either to selling your product, to creating the environmentfor selling, or to getting the prospect to read your copy, you areusing this wonderful and powerful trigger in a very effective wayto sell your product or service.
Finally, some stories add a unique human element that al-
lows you to relate to and bond very closely with your prospects.
Kathy Levine, formerly one of QVC’s top salespersons,
wrote in her book, It’s Better to Laugh (Pocket Books, 1995), “I
realized early on that selling is a matter of capturing people’s at-tention and holding it with a good story.”
The most interesting salespeople I know always have a
story to tell. It is their way of relating to their customers and en-tertaining them as well. One in particular has a repertoire of hun-
178UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
Telling a story is
a powerful tool tocreate a bondbetween you andyour prospects.
======================================== [Página 203] ========================================

dreds of jokes—each targeted to his prospect, to the selling envi-
ronment and what he has to sell. As you can imagine, he is veryeffective.
My most successful advertising campaigns all used stories
as the basis for my presentation. Here is one example of thistechnique from one of my most successful ads. I wrote an ad forBluBlocker sunglasses that will give you a ﬂavor of how a storycan be very helpful in creating human interest that will causeyour prospects to read your entire message.
Headline: Vision Breakthrough
Subheadline: When I put on the pair of glasses what I saw I
could not believe. Nor will you.
Byline: By Joseph Sugarman
Copy: I am about to tell you a true story. If you believe me, you
will be well rewarded. If you don’t believe me, I will make itworth your while to change your mind. Let me explain.
Len is a friend of mine who knows good products. One day he
called excited about a pair of sunglasses he owned. “It’s so in-credible,” he said, “when you ﬁrst look through a pair, you won’tbelieve it.”
“What will I see?” I asked. “What could be so incredible?”Len continued, “When you put on these glasses, your vision im-
proves. Objects appear sharper, more deﬁned. Everything takeson an enhanced 3-D effect. And it’s not my imagination. I justwant you to see for yourself.”
The story continues as I personally look through the sun-
glasses and learn more about them from Len. It uses a conversa-tional tone, but still covers all the important points about thesunglasses, the danger from ultraviolet (UV) rays, and the ad-vantage of screening out blue spectrum light rays. A story is usedvery effectively to build curiosity and cause the reader to read allthe copy, and eventually to read the ﬁnal sales pitch.
That ad for BluBlocker sunglasses launched a multimillion-
dollar company that eventually sold 20 million pairs of sun-glasses and has recently celebrated 20 years in business.
When writing copy for your product, think about using a
few stories that might be of interest to your prospect and assist inthe sale of your product: stories about a new development and
179THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
======================================== [Página 204] ========================================

how you discovered it—stories about yourself that would be of
interest to your prospects.
Timing is also important in the storytelling process. It is
nice to start with a story, because it holds attention and engagesthe prospect. Telling stories is an art form and using it effectivelyin a print ad grows with experience. Simply being aware of itspotential and its effectiveness is a good start. You’ll be surprisedat how many stories you’ll be able to come up with once you putyour mind to it.
A good story should capture a person’s attention, relate the
product or service in the copy and help you bond with theprospect.
27. Mental Engagement
Have you ever gone to a movie and known how it was going toend after watching the ﬁrst few minutes? Or a movie whereevery action can be easily anticipated? These movies tend not tobe very enjoyable.
However, the opposite is true when you watch a movie that
keeps you in suspense until the very end when it reaches a credi-ble but surprise ending. Any movie that is not predictable ismore enjoyable. I recently saw a movie called Inside Man about
what I thought was a bank robbery but turned out to be what Ileast expected. And the identity of the robbers was also a sur-prise at the end of the movie. I loved that ﬁlm.
What forces in our minds make us perceive one movie as a
lot better than another?
I have a theory that I strongly believe comes pretty close to
the answer: The more the mind must work to reach a conclusionthat it eventually successfully reaches, the more positive, enjoy-able, or stimulating the experience.
I taught this concept at my seminar for many years, and one
day one of my students brought me a copy of a media newsletterthat conﬁrmed what I had been teaching. The article claimed thata missing element was responsible for advertising failure—alack of whole-brain appeal.
180UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 205] ========================================

It then went on to explain how science is rapidly discover-
ing that different parts of the brain perform different functions.Some brain researchers suggest that human beings experiencethe most pleasure when all these parts of the brain are engaged inagreeable levels of stimulation and activity.
The four brain parts discussed were those that control
thought, intuition, sensation, and emotion. The article suggestedthat advertising that pleasurably engages the senses, emotions,and thought process, as well as our innate intuition, will tend tobe successful.
Advertising that merely grabs the attention of the senses
will tend to be only temporarily attractive. Most advertising teststoday reﬂect the power of day-after recall but fail to predict theresponse from whole-brain advertising.
Let’s look at how whole-brain advertising applies to writing
effective advertising copy. If you make your copy too obvious,the reader feels either looked down on or bored. Provide a littlesuspense so that the reader has to come to a conclusion on herown using intuition, thought, sensation, and emotion, and you’vegot a very good force working for you. Let me cite an examplefrom an ad I wrote on digital watches.
The ad was for an alarm chronograph digital watch for
which we were charging $99. At the time, Seiko was the stan-dard of comparison for this type of watch. Seiko was the ﬁrst outwith the new technology. The following paragraph from the adbest exempliﬁes what I’m talking about:
The Seiko chronograph alarm sells for $300. The watch costs
jewelers $150. And jewelers love the item, not only because ofthe excellent reputation of the Seiko brand, but because it’s prob-ably America’s best-selling new expensive digital watch. AndSeiko can’t supply enough of them to their dealers.
Now, note what I didn’t saybut what was still rather obvi-
ous. Read the quote again to see if you pick it up. Give up?What I didn’t say was that the jewelers were making a smallfortune each time they sold a Seiko. I didn’t have to say it, yetthe readers could come to their own conclusion all by them-selves using their intuition, thought, and emotions. Had I made
181THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
======================================== [Página 206] ========================================

it too obvious, by adding the line “and jewelers are making a
small fortune,” it would not have been as powerful. The mindhad to work a little to reach a conclusion through its ownthought processes. And when the reader compared our $99watch with the Seiko, it appeared that the jewelry stores andSeiko were soaking the consumer.
This is a very subtle but powerful concept. It’s the differ-
ence between talking down to prospects and making prospectsfeel you are talking directly to them. And it is one of the mostdifﬁcult theories to understand.
Working Hard Brings Appreciation
To get a better appreciation for the theory, think back in yourlife to times when you had to work hard to achieve somethingand how much more you appreciated what you achieved. I re-member all the work I had to go through to get my instrumentrating after getting my private pilot’s license. It took me
months of ﬂying and study, not to mention thousands of
dollars in expense. When I ﬁnally received my instrument
rating, it was a thrill.
In contrast, when I took my commercial rating test, it
was simple. Not that much study, very little ﬂying, and
within a few weeks I had the rating. Sure, I was proud that I
was ﬁnally a commercial pilot, but nowhere near as proud as
I was of my instrument rating. Working hard for a successful
conclusion results in a great deal of personal satisfaction.
The same holds true for the mind and the thinking
process. Anything that causes the mind to work hard to
reach a conclusion creates a positive, enjoyable or stimu-
lating effect on the brain. The opposite is true if the mind
does not have to work because the conclusion is obvious.
You appreciate that sale to a difﬁcult client a lot more than a
sale that is a pushover and takes only a minute. When a very dif-ﬁcult product is given to me to sell and I am successful, I getgreat pleasure from the achievement. But give me a really easyproduct—something that is already in demand—and I don’t havethe same feeling of satisfaction.
182UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
Anything that
causes the mind to work hard  toreach a conclusioncreates a positive,enjoyable or stimulating effecton the brain.

======================================== [Página 207] ========================================

Vague Descriptions Encourage Thinking
When Ernest Hemingway described beautiful women in his
books, he was never very speciﬁc. He used general terms and lethis readers imagine the women.
If you make your intentions too obvious, the prospect will
feel either patronized or bored. Make the prospect think in orderto come to a conclusion, and you create a very stimulating men-tal effect.
Too often we write too much. We reveal too much of the
pitch without allowing the prospect’s mind and intelligence tobecome engaged. Simply realizing how this powerful psycho-logical trigger works will help you craft copy that causes yourprospects’ brains to experience an enjoyable and stimulatingtime by allowing them to reach—on their own—the conclusionsthat you want them to reach.
28. Guilt
Have you ever received mailings from charities that include asmall gift? The gifts are usually address stickers, colorful stampsor some other inexpensive token. Or how about those mailingswith surveys that include a dollar bill or a reply envelope with areturn stamp? In both cases you may have experienced a slighttouch of guilt. After all, you’ve received something of value andyou feel an obligation to take some action in return, such as send-ing in a donation or answering the survey. These are good exam-ples of the use of guilt. But how do you use this technique in aprint ad when you can’t include stickers or a dollar bill?
Many people have told me that after they read one of my
ads, they not only are compelled to buy my product, but wouldfeel guilty if they didn’t. Instead of giving them stickers or a dol-lar bill, I give the reader plenty of compelling information andreading entertainment—so much so that they sense an obligationto respond. In a print ad, often the mere repetition of seeing anad in several magazines works to create a slight sense of guilt.  
Repeated mailings also create guilt. Keep sending some-
body mailings and after a while, they may feel guilty that they
183THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
======================================== [Página 208] ========================================

haven’t responded. I used this technique when I sold ski lifts for
a company called Ski Lift International. Each week I sent out asmall mailing with a premium gift enclosed. One mailing wouldhave a button, another an unusual mailing piece and still anotheran involvement device. After a while, many of the recipients feltguilty and responded. Some even apologized for not respondingearlier.
29. Speciﬁcity
Being speciﬁc in your explanations is very critical and can estab-lish your credibility. Let me ﬁrst give you an example. If I were to say, “New dentists everywhere use and recommendCapSnap Toothpaste,” it sounds like typical advertising lingo—puffery designed to sell a product. It’s so general that it willprobably cause a viewer to discount the statement I have justmade and maybe everything else I say. But if I said, “Ninety-twopercent of new dentists use and recommend CapSnap Tooth-paste,” it sounds much more believable. The consumer is likelyto think that we did a scientiﬁc survey and that 92 percent wasthe result.
When people perceive certain general statements as puffery
or typical advertising babble, those statements are at best dis-counted or accepted with some doubts. By contrast, statementswith speciﬁc facts can generate strong believability. In an ad Ionce wrote for a collectibles company I created called BattramGalleries, I stated the exact cost of running the ad and the exactcost of the product. I clearly demonstrated through speciﬁc ﬁg-ures that we weren’t making any proﬁt from the offering. It wasso successful, it was oversubscribed. I’ve used this technique onvideo as well.
In my BluBlocker infomercials, I state the speciﬁc reasons
why screening out blue spectrum light rays improves your vi-sion. I explain that blue light rays focus in front of the retina(which is the focusing screen of the eye) and not on the retina asdo the other colors. So when you block blue light, you blockthose rays that don’t focus on your retina and therefore objectsappear clearer, sharper and more deﬁned. I’m speciﬁc. It sounds
184UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 209] ========================================

believable. And the statement is a lot better than just saying,
“BluBlocker sunglasses let you see clearer, sharper and withmore deﬁnition.”
If you’re describing a product that is designed for the circu-
latory functions of the body, you can talk about “242 miles ofblood vessels” instead of “miles of blood vessels.” When youtalk about the bottom of your feet, instead of saying, “There area lot of nerve endings at the bottom of your feet,” you can say,“There are 72,000 nerve endings at the bottom of your feet.” Youare stating a fact as opposed to a general or vague statement. Youare more believable.
You Sound More like an Expert
There’s one other beneﬁt to being speciﬁc. By being speciﬁc yousound like you’re an expert on your product—you’ve really in-vestigated it and are very knowledgeable. And, this too, buildstrust and conﬁdence.
People, in general, are very skeptical about advertising and
often don’t believe many of the claims stated in ads. But whenyou make a speciﬁc claim using the exact facts and ﬁgures, yourmessage is much more credible and often trusted.
30. Familiarity
The Kowloon section of Hong Kong is an exotic part of thecity. Its storefronts, hordes of people and many sounds andsmells make for a very unique and exciting place to visit. It isdifferent. And when you are in Kowloon, America seems aw-fully far away.
I was walking down the street absorbing the energy of the
area and stopping occasionally to look in a store when suddenly,right in front of me, I saw one of my American suppliers walkingdown the sidewalk.
What a surprise! It was a wonderful feeling to see some-
body I knew in a foreign place like Hong Kong.
Although previously I hadn’t been that friendly with the
supplier, I suddenly felt close. I asked if he was available for din-ner and I made an appointment for that evening to get together
185THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
======================================== [Página 210] ========================================

and spend some time with him. As a result, he ended up selling
me a lot more than I normally would have bought. The con-trast of seeing somebody with whom you are familiar in a to-tally foreign setting creates a strong attraction. And so it iswith advertising.
An Ad as an Old Friend
If somebody is reading a magazine and sees your advertisingformat—something they have seen many times before—and rec-ognizes your logo or company name, there is a feeling of famil-iarity. They see a friend in an environment of foreign advertisersand to them you’re not foreign. You are familiar and as a resultthere is an attraction to your offering just as I was attracted to mysupplier in Hong Kong. 
Advertise enough times or sell a product whose name is fa-
miliar to your prospect and you will create the same attraction.That is why brand names are so important; that is why the famil-iarity of a shopping environment is also important.
When I ﬁrst appeared on QVC, the home shopping chan-
nel, we sold out our entire inventory of BluBlocker sunglasseswithin minutes. When our sunglasses ﬁrst appeared on retailshelves in the Walgreens drugstore chain, they quickly soldout within a few days. In short, our product was well known tothe consumer. Each time we introduced our product to a famil-iar shopping environment, the combination of brand name fa-miliarity and a familiar selling environment caused animmediate sellout.
The words familiar and familiarity have the word family in
them. People feel most comfortable within their own family.They feel conﬁdent and trusting and allow themselves to bemore vulnerable. So it is with anything people are familiar with.They trust a brand name, are more conﬁdent that they are buyingthe right product and are more inclined to do so.
One of the biggest mistakes traditional advertisers make is
to kill campaigns they have been using a long time because theyare tired of them. “Fly the friendly skies of United” and “You de-serve a break today, at McDonald’s” are but two examples famil-iar to consumers. In addition, consumers often sang along during
186UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 211] ========================================

these commercials. Too often in traditional advertising, the client
gets tired of the commercial long before the public does.
In direct marketing, a decision to drop a commercial ap-
proach is not arbitrary. You keep running your product or servicead until the public tells you when to stop by virtue of lowersales. The orders simply stop coming in or you have replacedyour ad with something that pulls more response. Good direct-marketing technique calls for continually revising or tweakingyour ad until it does better. But you never drop a campaign be-cause you are tired of it. Drop it only when the public stops ex-changing their hard-earned dollars for your product or service.
Now the traditional agencies will tell you something like,
“Well, we asked a focus group what they thought about ourslogan and they said that they were getting tired of it, so we are going to pull it.” This is a major fallacy, too. There is no realway to test the effectiveness of a commercial except by virtue of sales. Focus groups only tell you what they think you want to hear and not how they would act themselves. If the productisn’t selling, then look at the campaign. Maybe it isn’t even thecampaign but rather competition or some other element in themarketing mix.
Use Familiar Words
There are certain words that are more familiar to most peopleand to the human consciousness. For example, if you ask some-body to give you a number from 1 to 10 right off the top of theirhead, chances are the number 7 will be chosen more often thanany other number—often dwarﬁng the next choice. Therefore,using the number 7 in a book title such as “The Seven Ways toImprove Your Relationships” or “The Seven Spiritual Laws ofSuccess” is utilizing the most common and familiar integer of the ﬁrst 10. You are therefore vibrating with the familiar andharmonizing with your reader.
Ask somebody for a color off the top of their head and the
answer will be “red” the majority of the time. Ask them to namea piece of furniture and the answer will likely be “chair.” Thereare familiar words that can create a very subtle harmony withyour reader and it’s up to you to ﬁnd them and use them. Where
187THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
======================================== [Página 212] ========================================

do you ﬁnd them? Many books have been written on the effec-
tive use of words that really draw response. Books by DavidOgilvy or John Caples are good ones to read. A list can be foundin Appendix D. There are some powerful words such as sale or
free. And then there are the not so obvious words—the ones that
relate speciﬁcally to your product and which you, as a passion-ate devotee of your product, inherently already know. Finally,there are words that aren’t in your own consciousness and aren’tsingled out in any books but will be discovered only by testing.Sometimes, changing just one word in a thousand-word ad willdouble response.
As a copywriter, be aware of the powerful force of familiar-
ity to make a person comfortable with your product or service.Realize the importance of a familiar brand name, a logo that ap-pears many times and becomes well known, a layout that peopleinstinctively know is yours, familiar phrases (not clichés) andwords that your public can harmonize with—all of these rein-force the bond that familiarity creates between you and yourprospect.
31. Hope
Hope can be a great motivator in the buying process. A womanbuys a new face cream that offers the hope it will make a differ-ence in her wrinkles. An intense golfer buys a new golf ball thatoffers the hope it may take a few strokes off a golf game. In short,there is an implied possibility that using a product or service willprovide a future beneﬁt. The future beneﬁt is not assured, nor is itguaranteed; it is a dream, a fantasy or, at the most, a possibility.The hope replaces the reality of an already-delivered beneﬁt orguarantee that you receive when you buy other products such as aradio or a computer. Let me cite a few personal experiences anddescribe how hope applies to speciﬁc products.
I was introduced in 1996 to a very successful scientist. He
had supposedly invented a formula that cured a great many hu-man ills. The formula contained what he called “biological re-pair machines” that went to the source of a malfunction in yourbody and repaired it. If an organ was damaged, these miniature
188UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 213] ========================================

“machines” would repair the organ even if it meant regenerating
a new one.
You placed a few drops of this product under your tongue
twice a day and it was absorbed into your body.
In a discussion with the scientist, it occurred to me that if
people took this product they would never die, if indeed it re-paired any defective body part. He agreed. “I’m taking it andhonestly feel I am getting younger. Look, my gray hair is startingto turn black again.”
The scientist continued claiming that there was no reason
why his formula couldn’t keep us alive until the age of 300. Thissounded incredible to me. If this was true, this man had indeeddiscovered the fountain of youth. 
The scientist appeared to be very credible. He had several
Ph.D.’s, and I honestly thought he was one of the smartest peopleI had ever met. He had three manufacturing facilities in differentparts of the world. He had a reputation that extended all the wayto Europe and Asia, and he told me how he helped an Asiancountry cure many of its citizens of a speciﬁc form of cancer.
His discovery of the biological repair machines came to
him from uncovering formulas that were hidden in coded ancientartifacts and through the process of what he called “sacredgeometry.” He had apparently cracked the code and opened up awealth of information. He spent two hours showing me photo-graph after photograph to substantiate the information he had re-ceived from the artifacts.
I had a health problem that was not serious but, for what-
ever reason, doctors did not know its cause or cure. The problemwas a few small growths beneath the surface of my skin. Theywere not cancerous, others hardly noticed them and they posedno health threat. But they were there and they were not normal.
Surgery Was the Only Way
The only method doctors had for eliminating these growths wasto cut open the skin and surgically remove them—a relativelyeasy procedure that was done on an outpatient basis.
I was told by this scientist that indeed his formula could
eliminate the problem completely. “In just a few months they’ll be
189THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
======================================== [Página 214] ========================================

gone,” he said. In short, I received from him an explicitly clear
time frame during which my growths were going to melt awayand disappear. The promise wasn’t in the form of a hoped-for re-sult or a dream or even a possibility. It was a deﬁnite warrantythat they would disappear.
I was so impressed by him and his discoveries and he
seemed so credible that I decided to put his product to a test. A750 milliliter bottle (the size of a wine bottle) of his formula soldfor $600. It was rather expensive but it lasted a long time as youused only a few drops each day and it was less costly than the sur-gical procedure.
A Few Months Go By
After a few months, I noticed that the growths were not gone as Ihad been promised. I was then advised to buy his stronger for-mula—the one with a higher concentration of biological repairmachines. I did, at a cost of $2,000. There was still no improve-ment after two more months.
I was then told that there was a $20,000 bottle that would
do the job (boy, they saw me coming) and believe it or not, I wastempted to get a bottle. I didn’t.
Note: In all fairness to the scientist, there were clinical stud-
ies done on rats with his formula by a credible pharmaceuticalcompany and there were very positive results with the rats. Theresearch is continuing now on humans and he may have indeedcreated a powerful new medical concept.
What did I learn from this experience? The doctor should
have simply told me about how his formula improved his life. Itrusted him. He had all the credibility I needed for me to ingestthis foreign substance into my body. What if I could live to 300years of age? What if indeed I could become younger? I wouldhave gladly taken the formula and continued purchasing bottlesof it with the hope that I was right about him.
Scientist Made Fatal Error
But the scientist made a fatal error. Had he not made any claimsto me about speciﬁc expected results, I would not have been dis-appointed but would have continued taking the product waitingand hoping that the stuff would kick in and dissolve those
190UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 215] ========================================

growths. I would, on the basis of hope, have continued taking it
and buying more. But once a speciﬁc promise was made and Isaw that the formula didn’t work within that time frame, I imme-diately refused to invest further. The scientist’s credibility wasquestioned even though he may have had a great product.
When using the psychological trigger of hope, you must
avoid the trap of making a speciﬁc claim that can be measured orguaranteed. You want to allude to what the product is used forwithout making any promises of an exact outcome. 
There are other products people buy repeatedly, on hope.
Let’s take vitamins, for example. Can people tell if taking vita-mins makes a difference in their health? Yes, some can. Inter-view a bunch of people and they’ll swear the vitamins aremaking a difference. Capture those interviews on TV and theyare very impressive. Then prospects, impressed with the resultsshown on TV , start buying the product and continue to buy itregularly with the hope that it is making a difference in theirlives. But the key here is not to make a speciﬁc promise butrather to imply results through testimonials.
How does this apply to selling in print and on the Internet?
There are some products that are sold using hope as a strong mo-tivational tool. You need to determine the nature of your productand ﬁnd something that you can imply about a future result with-out stating a speciﬁc guarantee (particularly if you want to stayin business for a long time). 
Many product categories lend themselves to the power of
hope. The entire health food industry is a good example, includ-ing vitamins, food supplements and even brain enhancers. Low-ering your golf score, ﬁnding a new relationship, preventingwrinkles, impressing your date—all are good opportunities torecognize the psychological trigger of hope at work.
Focus on Credibility
One aspect to focus on when you create an ad using the power ofhope is credibility. If you present yourself as a credible personrepresenting a credible company, then what you say will elicit afeeling of conﬁdence on the part of your prospect. Then, what-ever you say your product did for you or for your previous
191THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
======================================== [Página 216] ========================================

customers will be taken as a possibility for your prospect, and
the power of hope will compel your prospect to order. And re-order. It might be a book on relationships and how the informa-tion changed your life and those of previous readers. It might bea formula you take to live a long life and how wonderful youfeel. Whatever you are selling, with the proper credibility, youwill automatically engage the power of hope to sell.
This chapter is very important in your understanding of the
underlying reasons why people buy. Some of the 31 psycholog-ical triggers to buying may not have been obvious to you be-fore. Nevertheless, an awareness of each of these points willgive you a tremendous boost in becoming a great copywriter.
192UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 217] ========================================

One of the least understood reasons why many products fail is
due to one aspect of human nature. Understand this aspect andnot only do you hold the key to creating a successful direct re-sponse ad, but you will also understand clearly why some prod-ucts just plain don’t sell.
The key to successfully marketing certain products lies in
the nature of that product and the way that product is viewed inthe marketplace. The guiding principle can be summed up veryclearly: Always sell the cure and avoid selling prevention.
Now what does this mean? Let me explain. If you were my
prospect and I tried to sell you a magic pill that contained an ex-tract of carrots and various tinctures of leafy vegetables becauseit would help prevent cancer, chances are it would be a difﬁcultsale. However, if you suddenly discovered you had cancer and Isaid to you that I had a magic pill that would cure the disease,you would be not only willing to try it, but willing to pay consid-erably more. In the ﬁrst instance, you might be willing to pay $20a bottle to prevent the disease but in the other you might be will-ing to pay $1,000 if it would cure the disease.
Human Nature at Play
The preceding is an extreme example. But let’s take something
less extreme. You’re a traveling salesperson and stay at hotels alot. Somebody tries to sell you a spray that you put on your feetbefore you go to sleep to prevent athlete’s foot, which mightcome from walking on a ﬂoor that hasn’t been cleaned thor-oughly. You ignore the sales message because you rarely get ath-lete’s foot, and besides, it’s a bother to use. The next week youget athlete’s foot and you’re at the corner pharmacy trying toﬁnd the strongest thing they’ve got to cure it.
The two situations illustrate two general principles. The
ﬁrst: It is human nature to think you’re never going to get the dis-
193Selling a Cure, Not Prevention Chapter 20
======================================== [Página 218] ========================================

ease or afﬂiction that the preventive can prevent, so it becomes a
very tough sell. The second: If you do get the disease or afﬂiction,you’re willing to pay a whole lot more for the cure than you werefor the preventive and it’s easier to sell.
I have been talking in medical or health terms. But this the-
ory also applies to several other products and concepts. I’ll gointo those in a moment, but let’s examine the ﬁrst step in break-ing through the cure/preventive theory and see if you can makethe appeal of the preventive as strong as the appeal of the cure.
It can be done, but only if you can position the product to
make the preventive the cure. Let me cite an example:
When the Midex burglar alarms were ﬁrst sold by JS&A in
the late 1970s, it was deﬁnitely a product that was more of a pre-ventive. However, I also knew that there were people who wererecently robbed or whose neighbors were recently robbed, and tothese people, the Midex alarm was more of a cure. Think aboutit. At ﬁrst they thought, “Naw, our neighborhood is safe. I don’tneed one.” And then after their neighborhood was robbed andthey needed a cure, “Boy, I’d better get one of those Midexalarms or else I may be next.” And of course, there was theprospect who had just been robbed: “Where did I see that ad forthat burglar alarm?”
I also knew that if I advertised in a
professional manner and explained thequality and value of my product and itsquick and easy installation, as opposedto using the scare tactics expressedthrough quoting crime statistics, I wouldattract a different kind of customer. Iwould attract the person not quite threat-ened but concerned—a person to whomthe product did not currently representprevention or a cure. In short, it was forsomebody who hadn’t been robbed andwhose neighbor hadn’t been robbed, but
who realized that there was a problem out there. This last groupwould save my ad, and when they needed it, they would take it
194UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
The consumer

======================================== [Página 219] ========================================

out of their ﬁles—often after several months—and call. This ac-
tually did happen a lot.
Twenty years ago, The Club automotive steering wheel
locking device would have been a tough sale. Back then, cartheft was not as big a problem as it is now. But with the increasein drug trafﬁc today and with thousands of cars being stolenevery hour, The Club has become more of a cure against yourfear of having your car stolen.
The big rage in health food and disease prevention a few
years ago was the melatonin craze. This is a hormone secretednaturally by the pineal gland—a pea-sized object at the center ofthe brain. It is supposed to help prevent aging. With millions ofbaby boomers turning 60, it became a very big product—more ofa cure than a preventive.
Many Products Make Powerful Cures
When I sold my wrinkle pill, Miracell, it, too, was a cure. If you
have wrinkles, you are a great prospect for wrinkle creams andtreatments. They represent cures, not preventives. And thinkabout it. Don’t the preventives like creams to moisturize yourskin and sunscreens to avoid sun damage cost a lot less than thecures? But some of the effective wrinkle eliminators cost plentyfor a small jar. Miracell sold at $25 for a month’s supply.
Insurance is another preventive. “Keep your family from
going through hard times after you die.” What could be tougherthan thinking you’re going to die someday? But the older youget, the more you think about it. And remember the story aboutmy friend, the insurance salesman, who always tried to sell meinsurance and ﬁnally succeeded when my next-door neighbordied suddenly at an early age? I couldn’t wait to sign the papers.
You must ﬁrst make a decision when evaluating a product.
Is this product a preventive or a cure? Can the product be posi-tioned as a cure rather than a preventive? Is the market trendchanging the perception of your product from being a preventiveto being a cure? Or do you simply have a preventive that doesnot have a broad enough market?
If you’ve got a cure and the market is large enough, you’ve
195SELLING A CURE, NOT PREVENTION
======================================== [Página 220] ========================================

got a powerful product. If you’ve got a preventive, think in terms
of how you can change it into a cure. Let me show you how thiscan be done.
Make a Preventive a Cure
Another pill I have been selling for the past few years, called
simply “The Pill,” is a fuel-conditioning treatment for automo-biles. It is a pill you put in your gas tank, and it is both a preven-tive and a cure.
First, as a preventive, it helps you avoid engine problems
by cleaning out your engine before anything serious happens toyour car from impurities that could lodge in your fuel injectors.It reduces pollution to help you pass the many mandatory emis-sions tests conducted throughout the United States, and it pre-vents you from having to visit the repair shop. Again, these arethe preventives.
But when I go on TV at QVC to present The Pill, I don’t talk
that much about what it prevents but rather what it cures. It curesengine knock, it eliminates ping, it saves up to 10 percent on gas.If you ﬂunk your emissions test, use The Pill and you’ll pass thenext time. In short, I emphasize the curative aspects of the prod-uct and underplay the preventive features. And The Pill is truly amiracle product. (I swear, it really works.) This brings me to mynext point.
Notice how I have to swear that The Pill really works. Sell-
ing truly breakthrough products is the toughest marketing job inthe world because people ﬁnd it difﬁcult to believe that theseproducts really work. And belief is one of the strongest motiva-tional factors in human nature. If your prospect believes insomething, he or she will move mountains to obtain it, but if heor she doesn’t believe in something, you won’t move thatprospect an inch.
In this chapter you’ve learned that you sell the cure, not the
preventive, that preventives don’t sell very easily and that someproducts can be changed from preventives to cures. You’ve alsolearned that you can charge a lot more for a cure than you can fora preventive. And ﬁnally, I’ve demonstrated that you can suc-cessfully market a product that is both a preventive and a cure byemphasizing its curative aspects while underplaying its preven-
196UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 221] ========================================

tive aspects. So let’s summarize what you’ve learned in a simple
statement that we can refer to in the future:
Selling a cure is a lot easier than selling a preventive, unless
the preventive is perceived as a cure or the curative aspects ofthe preventive are emphasized.
The information presented in this chapter will be very help-
ful for you in evaluating products in the future. Simply under-standing that the cure/preventive factor exists will help you toselect and then position your next product for selling.

You’ve gained a tremendous amount of knowledge reading
this book. And in Section Three you will use this knowledge toevaluate my mail order ads and those of others who attendedmy seminar.
But how are you going to rate yourself in the future? Is
there some measure you can apply to your writing to determineif you are communicating at the level you need to in order toreach your audience? 
Well, fortunately there is a way, thanks to Robert Gun-
ning, who created the Fog Index for newspaper writers to helpthem avoid so-called foggy writing and determine for them-selves the grade level of the copy they were writing. In short,were they writing with enough clarity so that a ﬁfth gradercould understand their copy or must a reader be in high schoolor even college to understand it? The lower the grade level, thewider the audience.
Reaching a Mass Market
For example, if I wanted to reach a mass market, I would keep
my ad copy simple and my sentences short and I wouldn’t usebig words. On the other hand, if I wanted to reach a very upscaleaudience, I might use bigger words and longer sentences.
Best-selling books are written for the 8th to 10th grade level.
Time, BusinessWeek and the Wall Street Journal are 11th grade
level. The Gettysburg Address and Reader’s Digest have a 10th
grade level in common. And for the most part, the average Amer-ican audience reads between the 11th and 12th grade levels.
The following are the steps for determining the Fog Index,
or grade level, of the copy you write:
1.Take a sample of your copy—start with 100 to 125 words
from the very beginning of the ad.
199Rating Your Writing Level Chapter 21
======================================== [Página 224] ========================================

2.Count the words in each sentence. Dates and numbers equal
one word and independent clauses count as separate sentences(e.g., “We studied, and we learned” would be two sentences).
3.Divide the total number of words by the number of sentences
to get the average sentence length.
4.Count the number of long words (those of three or more sylla-
bles), but:
• Do not count short-word combinations like pawnbroker or
yellowtail .
• Do not include proper names.• Do not include verbs that have become three syllables by
adding edor es.
5.Divide the number of long words by the total number of
words in the selection to get the percentage of long words.
6.Add the average sentence length to the percentage of long
words.
7.Multiply this total by 0.4 to get the grade level.
Now let’s use as an example the Vision Breakthrough ad we
discussed in Chapter 19 under “Storytelling.” The ad is pre-sented in full in Chapter 32. I will take the ﬁrst 102 words ofcopy, and show you how to determine the grade level.
I am about to tell you a true story. If you believe me, you will be
well rewarded. If you don’t believe me, I will make it worth yourwhile to change your mind. Let me explain.
Len is a friend of mine who knows good products. One day 
he called excited about a pair of sunglasses he owned. “It’s soincredible ,” he said, “when you ﬁrst look through a pair, you
won’t believe it.”
“What will I see?” I asked. “What could be so incredible ?”
Len continued , “When you put on these glasses, your vision im-
proves. Objects appear sharper, more deﬁned.
I have put the three long words in bold type. There are 102
total words in this selection and 11 sentences. This means thatthe average number of words per sentence is 9.3.
The next step is to divide the number of long words (3) by the
total words (102) to get the percentage of long words: 2.9 percent.
200UNDERSTANDING WHAT WORKS
======================================== [Página 225] ========================================

Now add the average sentence length of 9.3 words to the per-
centage of long words, which is 2.9, and you have the number12.2. Then multiply the number 12.2 by 0.4 and you end up withthe number 4.9. In short, this ad started out being understandableto a very large segment of the market by virtue of the fact that itwas quite comprehensible to anybody reading at about the ﬁfthgrade level and above.
Incidentally, the next block of copy in that same ad had
about the same reading level. The third block of copy jumped to7.2, but by that time the reader was well into the copy. I wouldsuggest that you take different 100-word blocks from differentparts of your ad to see how consistent your style is.
Try this with one of your ads or with one of the many ads in
Section Three. It is an easy way to determine the level of com-prehension of your writing and it will also make you aware ofthe effect that multisyllabic words and long sentences have onthe comprehensibility of your ad and the level of reader that willresonate with your copy.
The ad that we just tested was one of JS&A’s most success-
ful. And it seemed that with many of my ads, the greater the clar-ity, the broader the appeal and the greater the response. Afteryou’ve tried it with some of the ads in this book or other ads,you’ll be amazed at how easily you will be able to guess the FogIndex from reading just the ﬁrst few paragraphs of any ad.
Clarity is one of the most important factors in writing copy,
and the Fog Index gives you an insight into how important shortsentences and simple words can be. But don’t be obsessed withachieving low Fog Index scores at the expense of commonsense. You need to vary the length of sentences and use three-syllable words when you need them and realize that every audi-ence is different.
201RATING YOUR WRITING LEVEL
======================================== [Página 226] ========================================


======================================== [Página 227] ========================================

One of your reactions to having read the steps involved in writ-
ing copy might be that there are a lot of things to keep in mind asyou craft your ad. And indeed there are.
But if I were to reduce everything down to a simple
seven-step formula, I would suggest the following, keeping inmind that you have read this book and have comprehended itsprinciples.
Step 1: Become an expert on the product or service you are
planning to sell. I have gotten more great ideas delving into dis-covering everything I could about a product or service than Ihave from any other resource.
Step 2: Know your prospect. You might become an expert
on your product or service but if you don’t know your customer,you’re at a big disadvantage. What will motivate your prospectto become a customer? Who is your typical prospect? This willgive you insight and also spur lots of good ideas.
Step 3: Write your headline and subheadline. They must
grab the reader and create enough curiosity to cause the reader toget to the ﬁrst sentence. I like headlines that are short. “VisionBreakthrough,” “Pocket CB,” “Pocket Yellow Pages”—all areconcise and yet create enough curiosity to get you to the sub-headline. Subheadlines should be around 16 words, and ﬁrst sen-tences should be as short as possible.
Step 4: Write the copy. Don’t worry about sentence struc-
ture, grammar, punctuation—just start writing and keep writing.Let all your ideas and thoughts ﬂow into the computer and aboveall don’t worry about making mistakes. The main idea is to takeeverything that is in your head about the subject and dump it intoyour hard drive. If you write your copy by hand or with a type-writer, write with the same abandon. However, you’re a lot bet-ter off writing your ad with a computer, especially when it comesto editing.
203Seven Steps to Writing Great Copy Chapter 22
======================================== [Página 228] ========================================

Step 5: Edit your copy. Go through it and correct the
spelling, grammar, punctuation and sentence structure. Eliminateextra words not necessary to express your thoughts. Tightenthings up.
Step 6: Incubate. Stop editing, put the text aside and take a
walk or do something pleasurable. You’ll be amazed at what get-ting away from your text will do for you. If you can come backto it the next day, better yet. The more time between what you’vejust edited and taking the next step—all the better.
Step 7: Take a ﬁnal look at your copy. You’ll be amazed at
how much more you’re going to catch and how much more re-ﬁned you will be able to make the copy with this ﬁnal look. Ofcourse you could easily repeat steps 5 and 6 and continue to edituntil you are happy with your results.
These seven steps summarize what you as a copywriter will
go through to write copy. It’s really that simple. And if you’velearned the principles of writing copy, each time you do this youwill get better at it. That I can guarantee.
You’ve Learned a Great Deal
You have learned what it takes to be a great copywriter in Sec-
tion One. You have learned in Section Two what works and whyit works. 
In the ﬁrst two sections of this book I have taught you most
of the copywriting techniques I taught my seminar participants.You have learned techniques that took me many years to de-velop. You have learned concepts that I didn’t discover and per-sonally use until well into my career. And most importantly, youhave learned from my failures—an education that has cost medearly but that you do not have to experience on your own. Fi-nally, you did not have to pay $3,000 to get this knowledge asmy seminar participants did.
In Section Three we take all that you have learned and crys-
tallize it into practical knowledge by examining many of the adsthat were used as examples in our seminar. This is an importantsection, for here you see how all the pieces you have learned ﬁttogether. We also examine a few ads where the pieces didn’tquite ﬁt together and we show you how they could have beendone more effectively.

In addition to examining a few ads from beginning to end, I
also reproduce a few of the JS&A ads that show my principles inaction.
If you’ve had a problem understanding any of the princi-
ples, this is where you’ll get greater understanding and clarity. Itwas during this part of my seminar when participants would of-ten comment, “Now I feel I can do a great ad myself.” And theyoften did.

You’ve learned the principles and theory of copywriting and
you’ve had a chance to see how it all works through my manypersonal experiences. Now it’s time to show you how these prin-ciples actually work in some of the complete ad examples thatfollow. This is the ﬁne-tuning you’ll need to perfect your newlylearned skills.
During the course of my seminar I showed slides of various
ads to illustrate the theories I was presenting. In my ﬁrst semi-nars, the ads were mine and those of my competitors—the verycompanies that were copying my format. But as the course con-tinued and more and more of my students succeeded with theknowledge I gave them, many of the ads I showed at subsequentseminars were created by my former students themselves.
Finally, I used illustrations to show the best and the worst of
mail order advertising and even non-mail-order advertising. By theend of the course, not only were my students able to tell me whatwas wrong with each of the ads that I showed but they were pro-ducing great advertising copy and even helping their fellow semi-nar participants in crafting and improving their advertisements.
Hundreds of ads were presented during the seminar—all on
slides. Several of the classic examples were duplicated andpassed around. For the book I have selected only a few of thebest ads to illustrate the principles I taught—examples that willsolidify everything you’ve learned so far and add even more toyour insights and copywriting skills.
“But hey,” you might wonder. “What about those famous
JS&A mail order ads that were the hallmark of mail order adver-tising in the 1970s and 1980s? Don’t they point out some reallyimportant principles and aren’t they good examples of the best incopywriting?”
Shucks. Well, if you insist. Okay, I’ll include some of those
as well.
209Proving the Points—Ad Examples Preview
======================================== [Página 234] ========================================

Starting in Chapter 28 are some of the JS&A ads that really
drive home various points. Not only are they examples of suc-cessful copywriting but they are entertaining as well. The factthat I wrote them might come through in my enthusiasm andcommentary, so please bear with me. Deep down, I’m really amodest kinda guy.
If your future is in TV marketing, these examples will help
you understand marketing in that medium as well. For as youhave already learned, my copywriting and marketing principlescan be applied to any form of advertising communication.
But now it’s time to solidify everything you’ve learned in
Sections One and Two with some classic ad examples to provemany of my points.
210PROVING THE POINTS—AD EXAMPLES
======================================== [Página 235] ========================================

This is a classic example of a mail order ad. There
are some people who spend their entire career creat-ing hundreds of ads, and then there is Joe Karbo.
Joe Karbo wrote only a few ads. He wrote the
one I’ve featured here right off the top of his head.There was practically no editing involved. As he laterclaimed at my seminar, “I just sat down and wrote thead in a matter of a few minutes and then looked backat it, made a few changes, and that was it.”
The ad Joe created ran in hundreds of magazines
for many years. In later years, it was rewritten to re-ﬂect more current mail order approaches, but it wasbasically the same ad. And it has become a classic.
First, a little background on Joe. Joe Karbo was
discharged from the Army in 1945, and at age 20 witha wife and child, no money and only a high schooleducation, he started his business career. Karbo wasmodestly successful in the scrap paper business and then hemoved on to acting, followed by advertising, radio and ﬁnallytelevision. 
Karbo had his own TV show in Hollywood and, along with
his wife Betty, was on the air from midnight to 8 
A.M. Since
sponsors were hard to come by, Karbo started a direct mailbusiness and sold a variety of products on his show. Joe soonmastered direct response advertising and ﬂourished.
In 1973 Joe formalized his personal philosophies in a
book called The Lazy Man’s Way to Riches in which he shared
his beliefs and principles both on success and on direct re-sponse advertising. The ad shown is the one he wrote to mar-ket his book.
Let’s examine the ad, as it will conﬁrm many of the things
211The Lazy Man’s Way to Riches Chapter 23
This classic 
mail order ad

books.
======================================== [Página 236] ========================================

you have already learned. We’ll start at the headline and system-
atically work our way through the entire ad.
Headline: The Lazy Man’s Way to Riches
Subheadline: ‘Most People Are Too Busy Earning a Living to
Make Any Money’
The headline is provocative. At the time, this was a novel
approach and a novel headline. Prior to this, ads such as thiswere found only in the group of magazines classiﬁed as “incomeopportunity.” Magazines such as Income Opportunity, Success
and Entrepreneur had dozens of offers such as the one Karbo
was making, but the category of advertising hadn’t yet made itinto the mainstream. Joe’s was one of the ﬁrst to break through.The headline grabbed you and got you to read the subheadline.And the subheadline got you into the copy. 
Let’s start with the copy and see if he is creating that slip-
pery slide. First, notice how he gets you into the copy by the useof short sentences. Notice how short the ﬁrst sentence is and howshort all his sentences are. Also notice how he is identifying withhis prospect—the guy or gal who is serious about succeedingand wants a good life but ﬁnds himself or herself working hardand not getting anywhere. The copy starts out as follows:
I used to work hard. The 18-hour days. The 7-day weeks.
But I didn’t start making big money until I did less—a lot less.
The ad continues and you’re compelled to read further.
For example, this ad took about 2 hours to write. With a little
luck, it should earn me 50, maybe a hundred thousand dollars.
Remember, this was written in 1973 and the equivalent of a
hundred thousand dollars today might be close to a half-milliondollars. Once again, Karbo is building curiosity. What is he offer-ing? Why will this ad earn him so much money? You’ve got toread further. Notice also that there are no big words, no compli-cated long sentences. He’s leading his reader into the copy slowlyand easily, building curiosity as he goes. He tells a story as heprogresses.
What’s more, I’m going to ask you to send me 10 dollars for
something that’ll cost me no more than 50 cents. And I’ll try tomake it so irresistible that you’d be a darned fool not to do it.
212PROVING THE POINTS—AD EXAMPLES
======================================== [Página 237] ========================================

Here Karbo is establishing trust with his readers. His hon-
esty is almost disarming. He tells you up front that he has some-thing he wants to sell you for 10 dollars that costs him only 50cents. He’s also building curiosity. He’s using basic and simplestatements, and the copy has you slowly slipping down his slip-pery slide right to the next paragraph. Then note how he justiﬁesthe purchase.
After all, why should you care if I make $9.50 proﬁt if I can
show you how to make a lot more?
What if I’m so sure that you will make money my Lazy Man’s
Way that I’ll make you the world’s most unusual guarantee?
And here it is: I won’t even cash your check or money order for
31 days after I’ve sent you my material.
That’ll give you plenty of time to get it, look it over, try it out.
Note the ﬂow of the copy. Again he builds on the reader’s
curiosity, justifying the $10 purchase even if he hasn’t yet toldyou about the offer. Now you are really curious. He wasn’t goingto cash the check for 31 days, which at the time was a novel ap-proach. It was what I call a “satisfaction conviction” becauseyour reaction might have been, “Boy, a lot of people are going torip him off. They’re going to get his book, read it and then returnit and get their uncashed check back in the mail.” You alreadyknow how important a good satisfaction conviction can be fromChapter 19, and Karbo uses it here, early in his copy. He alsoshows a degree of enthusiasm and conﬁdence in his concept thatraises your curiosity even more. He continues.
If you don’t agree that it’s worth at least a hundred times what
you invested, send it back. Your uncashed check or money order
will be put in the return mail.
The only reason I won’t send it to you and bill you or send it C.O.D.
is because both these methods involve more time and money.
And I’m already going to give you the biggest bargain of your life.Because I’m going to tell you what it took me 11 years to perfect:
How to make money the Lazy Man’s Way.
Again, Karbo is justifying the purchase without even telling
you what it is. And he is justifying why accepting payment bycheck is the only way he’ll sell it to you, giving you an economic
213THE LAZY MAN’S WAY TO RICHES
======================================== [Página 238] ========================================

basis for his decision. The curiosity builds. But instead of telling
you about his offer, he now changes direction completely to es-tablish credibility for his offer by presenting himself as an exam-ple of how successfully this program has worked.
O.K.—now I have to brag a little. I don’t mind it. And it’s neces-
sary—to prove that sending me ten dollars...which I’ll keep “inescrow” until you’re satisﬁed...is the smartest thing you ever did.
I live in a home that’s worth $100,000. I know it is because I
turned down an offer for that much. My mortgage is less thanhalf that, and the only reason I haven’t paid it off is because myTax Accountant says I’d be an idiot.
My “ofﬁce,” about a mile and a half from my home, is right on
the beach. My view is so breathtaking that most people commentthat they don’t see how I get any work done. But I do enough.About 6 hours a day, 8 or 9 months a year.
The rest of the time we spend at our mountain “cabin.” I paid
$30,000 for it—cash.
I have 2 boats and a Cadillac. All paid for.We have stocks, bonds, investments, cash in the bank. But the
most important thing I have is priceless: time with my family.
And I’ll show you just how I did it—the Lazy Man’s Way—a se-
cret I’ve shared with just a few friends ’til now.
Here in these last paragraphs he is obviously whetting your
appetite and telling you what the results of his system producedfor him. But there is another very subtle thing he has done aswell. He is trying to personally identify with his audience. Hedoesn’t talk about driving around in a Rolls-Royce but rather aCadillac. He talks about having a mortgage, which most of hisreaders, if they own their own homes, probably have. He keepshis wealth to a modest level, for if it was too far out of the reachof his readers, they would not be able to relate to Karbo.
He is also selling the sizzle, not the steak. He is relating a
number of things, most of which sound pretty inviting to you andrepresent the results of buying his system—the many materialthings in life that most of his readers dream of having. He isidentifying with his prospects. And then at the end of the list, hetalks about the most priceless thing his system has created, “timewith my family.” All of this resonates with the reader, who bynow can’t stop reading and might be saying, “What does this guyhave to offer that can make it possible for me to live the life of

======================================== [Página 239] ========================================

Joe Karbo?” So you read on. You read the secret that he’s shared
with only a few friends.
In the next paragraph you ﬁnd one of the truly important
highlights of his ad copy. He is very subtly trying to expand theappeal of his offer to the broadest possible segment of the market.Think about it. If he said that one person made millions, you mightnot identify with what he is saying if you honestly didn’t believethat you could earn millions. But you might relate to the little oldlady who is now able to travel wherever she wants or the widowwho is earning $25,000 extra a year. Or the guy who doesn’t havemuch of an education.
As you read the following copy, see how he appeals to the
mass market—probably the single reason that this ad had suchwidespread appeal and was not conﬁned to just the income oppor-tunity area. Also see where he again builds on his integrity whenhe talks about almost declaring bankruptcy—thus relating to manyin his audience who may also be facing ﬁnancial difﬁculty.
It doesn’t require “education.” I’m a high school graduate.
It doesn’t require “capital.” When I started out, I was so deep in
debt that a lawyer friend advised bankruptcy as the only way out.He was wrong. We paid off our debts and, outside of the mort-gage, don’t owe a cent to any man.
It doesn’t require “luck.” I’ve had more than my share, but I’m
not promising you that you’ll make as much money as I have.And you may do better: I personally know one man who usedthese principles, worked hard, and made 11 million dollars in 8years. But money isn’t everything.
It doesn’t require “talent.” Just enough brains to know what to
look for. And I’ll tell you that.
It doesn’t require “youth.” One woman I worked with is over 70.
She’s travelled the world over, making all the money she needs,doing only what I taught her.
It doesn’t require “experience.” A widow in Chicago has been
averaging $25,000 a year for the past 5 years, using my methods.
These last sentences are very important. In short, he ap-
pealed to a very broad segment of the opportunity market andeven went beyond it to people who might not be looking for anopportunity but would ﬁnd this message compelling. And Karbocomes across as being incredibly honest. Remember, he told youthe cost of what he was going to send you and he seems to be
215THE LAZY MAN’S WAY TO RICHES
======================================== [Página 240] ========================================

very honest throughout his ad, even to the point of being disarm-
ing. Remember, honesty is a powerful psychological selling tool.
Now comes the closing pitch, with complete and total enthu-
siasm for his concept and his book. Once again, Karbo realizesthat many of his readers have jobs and at this point in the copy arewondering if they will have to give them up to learn what he hasto offer. He uses a little sage wisdom given to him by a wise manhe met. And then he wraps up the entire ad with a question thatbuilds the ﬁnal level of curiosity to a point that compels you to re-spond in order to ﬁnd out what this man has to offer.
What does it require? Belief. Enough to take a chance. Enough to
absorb what I’ll send you. Enough to put the principles into ac-
tion. If you do just that—nothing more, nothing less—the results
will be hard to believe. Remember—I guarantee it.
You don’t have to give up your job. But you may soon be making
so much money that you’ll be able to. Once again—I guarantee it.
The wisest man I ever knew told me something I never forgot:
“Most people are too busy earning a living to make any money.”
Don’t take as long as I did to ﬁnd out he was right.I’ll prove it to you, if you’ll send in the coupon now. I’m not ask-
ing you to “believe” me. Just try it. If I’m wrong, all you’ve lostis a couple of minutes and an 8-cent stamp. But what if I’m right?
It is interesting to see the cost of a ﬁrst class stamp back in
1973. Today as I write this book a stamp costs 39 cents, so thecost of his book relative to the cost of a postage stamp wasequivalent to $50 in today’s dollars.
Then you examine the coupon. But right above the coupon
you ﬁrst read a sworn statement from his accountant: 
“I have examined this advertisement. On the basis of personal ac-
quaintance with Mr. Joe Karbo for 18 years and my professionalrelationship as his accountant, I certify that every statement istrue.” (Accountant’s name available upon request.) 
He also includes his bank reference. Once again, this really is
very convincing as prior to Karbo, nobody had ever put anythinglike this in an ad. He was strongly establishing his credibility by us-ing the bank’s name as an indirect testimonial to his honesty—something his prospects needed in order to feel conﬁdent to reachfor their checkbooks and send him their hard-earned money.
216PROVING THE POINTS—AD EXAMPLES
======================================== [Página 241] ========================================

The coupon is a summary of the offer. 
Joe, you may be full of beans, but what have I got to lose? Send
me the Lazy Man’s Way to Riches. But don’t deposit my check or
money order for 31 days after it’s in the mail.
If I return your material—for any reason—within that time, re-
turn my uncashed check or money order to me. On that basis,
here’s my ten dollars.
He even has a small box you can check if you want his
“material” sent by airmail for only one dollar more.
Note that he is sending “material” and not just a book. “Ma-
terial” makes the program appear much more valuable—morelike a course as opposed to a book. It has much more sizzle thanjust saying “book.”
If you sent in your money, you received a wonderful book
that actually looked like it cost about 50 cents to print. But itcontained both a motivational message and the direct marketingtechniques necessary to make money the “Lazy Man’s Way.”
Karbo ran these ads for several years. I had been establish-
ing the fact in my national advertising that there was no suchthing as too many words. By 1973 we were really cranking outour advertising, but mostly in the Wall Street Journal. One year
later when we advertised in many national magazines, we no-ticed that Karbo’s copy was expanding to include testimonialsand more examples to cover the broad market he was trying toreach. The ads became more wordy with each passing year.
But it was Joe’s very ﬁrst ad—the ﬁrst major mass market
advertising campaign to come from the income opportunity areain many years—that was the purest example of what I was teach-ing in my seminar.
Joe Karbo attended my seminar in 1978. At my seminar he
shared his background and told the story of how he wrote thisone ad.
Joe died in 1980 from a massive heart attack. He was being
interviewed at a local TV station near his home in Californiawhen the interviewer decided to unfairly attack Joe, thus chang-ing entirely the premise of the interview. Joe’s ﬁrst reaction wasa heart attack from which he never revived. Joe was survived byhis wife Betty and eight children.

His work and efforts have been continued in an excellent
recently revised version of his book (by Richard Gilly Nixon) in-cluding a workbook. Any student of mail order needing some re-ally good motivation should purchase it. Please see the listing inAppendix D for this course as well as several other good directmarketing books.
The Karbo ad was a classic. It was his biggest and best shot
in the mail order business and its signiﬁcance was felt by themany millions who bought his book and later indeed proﬁted byit. But if this seemed like a real ﬂuke—a once-in-a-lifetime ex-perience that would be impossible to duplicate—you’re wrong.It is happening even as you read this, with other entrepreneursusing direct marketing as a method to market their products.
The next true story tells of somebody who never wrote print
mail order copy before he sat down and wrote one of the classiclong-running mail order ads of the decade, and he did it right af-ter attending my seminar. Read on.

Frank Lewis Schultz is a farmer who grows grape-
fruit in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. For years hehad used a simple letter or direct mailing to build hiscustomer base into a nice-sized business that soldgrapefruit by mail. But something always seemed toelude him. He couldn’t get print mail order advertis-ing to work for him.
He realized that space advertising (the idea of
reaching millions of people for the same price it takes toreach thousands by mail) sounded like a great concept.And along with reaching millions, he could add credi-bility to his company and more proﬁt to his bottom line.
It all sounded great until Schultz hired one of the
nation’s most respected direct response agencies. Theﬁrst ad bombed. So did the second. In fact, his grosssales didn’t cover the raw cost of the ad space.Schultz was discouraged.
When I announced my ﬁrst seminar in 1977, Schultz was
one of the ﬁrst to sign up. During the seminar, he was very quiet,but he seemed to be absorbing everything I had to say. I didn’tknow at the time that he had a degree in marketing from theUniversity of California at Berkeley.
After the seminar, with the information fresh in his mind, 
he went to the local Holiday Inn in Minocqua, Wisconsin, andstarted drafting his ﬁrst print ad.
He based it on both the successful letter that he had run for
years and the information I had taught. And the result was sentto me in Northbrook, Illinois, upon my return home after theseminar.
The ad was great. It wasn’t the very technical style of the
JS&A ads, but it had a homespun feel that grabbed you at the

ﬁrst ad and 
it became 
a classic.
======================================== [Página 244] ========================================

start and drew you through the copy all the way to the very end.
As Frank later said about the seminar and what he had learnedabout writing copy, “It was actually pretty easy because sud-denly everything was clear. I knew what I had to say and how tosay it. I learned that you don’t have to be a professional copy-writer to write effective copy.”
When I received Schultz’s ad, I called him on the phone and
told him, “Your ad is great. I only have a few changes to suggestbut they are minor. Your big problem is the headline.” I suggested“Fluke of Nature” instead of “A Stroke of Luck from Mother Na-ture”—the one he had written. I suggested the subheadline: “A newgrapefruit discovery may change your concept of fruit.” I also sug-gested he take out a line, “The zesty ﬂavor of Royal Ruby Redgrapefruit juice will help start your day with a smile,” as it seemedalmost a cliché—something an ad agency might have written. Andthere were several other small changes, but again, they were minor.
There were two pictures captioned with copy explaining the
offer, and of course all the elements were designed to get you toread the ﬁrst sentence. Let’s examine the copy as we did with theKarbo ad and see how Schultz captured the essence of what Itaught, and in a very simple yet persuasive way. The copy startsout with a ﬁrst paragraph that was printed in bold type to act al-most as a subheadline, thus drawing you further into the copy:
I’m a farmer. And the story I tell you is the absolute truth, as in-
credible as it may seem.
This is a classic opening for an ad. Remember we talked
about how each word has an emotion and a story attached to it?What does the word farmer bring to mind? How about honesty,
hard work and integrity? Simply by stating that he is a farmer, hehas established a degree of credibility right from the start of thead. And then look at the curiosity he creates right away in thesecond sentence. How could you not continue?
It all started in a grove owned by Dr. Webb, our family doctor.
One of the men who was picking fruit in the doctor’s orchardcame up to the Webb house holding six of the strangest grapefruitanyone had ever seen. A single branch of an ordinary grapefruittree had produced these six unusual fruit.
These were big grapefruit, unusually big. And they had a faint
220PROVING THE POINTS—AD EXAMPLES
======================================== [Página 245] ========================================

red blush on their skin. When Dr. Webb sliced open the grape-
fruit, the fruit was a brilliant ruby red in color.
Dr. Webb decided to taste this strange new grapefruit. The fruit
was perfect, juicy and luscious. It wasn’t sour like other grape-fruit either—it was naturally sweet without sugar.
For some reason, we’ll never know why, nature had chosen to
produce an entirely new kind of grapefruit here in our Magic RioGrande Valley. It was incredible—men had labored for years toproduce the ideal grapefruit, and had failed. But suddenly on asingle branch of one tree in one grove, Mother Nature had done itall by herself!
The copy reads almost like a fairy tale with the use of the
Magic Rio Grande Valley name and the story of this unexpecteddiscovery. Schultz created this environment—all woven througha compelling and interesting story that holds your attention andkeeps you reading. You can’t stop now. You’ve got to see wherethis all takes you. Schultz now goes into more detail on the fruititself. And he uses one technique that you would never believecould be applied to fruit. He makes his product a rarity—a lim-ited edition to be shared by very few people. Read the followingand see what I mean.
YOU CAN IMAGINE THE EXCITEMENT
From the fruit on that one branch, grove after grove now pro-
duces our own Texas Ruby Red Grapefruit. When I say, “Not oneman in a thousand has ever tasted this grapefruit”—you can eas-ily understand why.
To begin with, Ruby Reds are rare. You can look for them in
stores but I doubt if you’ll ﬁnd one. You may ﬁnd pink grape-fruit, but seldom if ever do you see the genuine Ruby Reds.
So you start with the rarity of Ruby Reds, and to get to ROYAL
Ruby Reds you have to get rarer yet. Only 4 to 5 percent of theentire crop will qualify as a “Royal Ruby Red.”
Schultz graphically brought out the true rarity of what he
was selling. You can certainly do that with a collectible, but thesimple way Schultz made his fruit rare was ingenious. After hetold you that “not one man in a thousand has ever tasted thisgrapefruit,” you might have thought he was going to pitch youon the fruit. Instead he started to explain what makes it evenmore rare. And it got so rare that it seemed quite plausible thatfew people indeed have tasted this fruit.
221A FLUKE OF NATURE
======================================== [Página 246] ========================================

In the next passage, Schultz continues to build the story but
now he makes his message a very personal one. It almost soundslike he goes right into the grove with his men to pick the fruit. Heis personally involved in every step of the growing and pickingprocess, and he uses this approach to make his message personal.Secondly, he even uses a technical explanation—something thatreally builds conﬁdence in the expertise he brings to his farming.A technical explanation in selling electronics would make sense,but see how he does it here with a very nonscientiﬁc product—grapefruit. And he also gets you totally involved with the fruit it-self. Your taste buds are activated and you can almost savor thegrapefruit as you read the copy. He is actually using your sense oftaste as an involvement device. Instead of turning the knobs of aTV set or clicking on the keys of a calculator to involve you, he’sgetting you to salivate. The copy continues:
Each Royal Ruby Red weighs a pound—or more! Each has a rich
red color, ﬂowing juices, luscious naturally sweet ﬂavor, and theability to stay this way for many weeks.
Why, we won’t even consider harvesting a grove until I’ve
checked out the fruit for tree-ripened maturity myself. I check for“natural sugar,” low acid balance and high juice content. I checkto see that the fruit is plump and meaty, and I even check to seethat the skin is thin. Not only does each factor have to check out,but all the factors have to be in a proper relationship to each otherbefore I’ll harvest a grove.
And when we pick the fruit, we’re just as fussy. Every one of us
takes a “picking ring” when we harvest. If the fruit is smallenough to pass through this ring—we don’t pick it! It simply isn’tbig enough to qualify as a Royal Ruby Red!
Even after picking there are other careful inspections each fruit
must pass before I’ll accept it. I size the fruit. And I grade it forbeauty. Sometimes the fruit will be wind scarred. I won’t acceptit. Or sometimes it will have a bulge on the stem that we call“sheep nose.” I won’t accept it. You can see I really mean it whenI say I accept only perfect Royal Ruby Reds.
By now you can just picture Frank Schultz out in the grove
with his picking ring rejecting wind-scarred grapefruit or fruitthat has sheep nose. By now you are actually convinced that thisfruit is very carefully selected—chosen not only for its juicecontent but also for its beauty. Beauty? Yep, beauty.
Probably the one thing that he uses with great skill is the
222PROVING THE POINTS—AD EXAMPLES
======================================== [Página 247] ========================================

personal nature of his presentation. His company sounds small—
as if it is made up of just Schultz and a few other pickers. Andthey all go out with their picking rings, spend the day gatheringonly the prettiest and juiciest grapefruit, and then return withtheir harvest for shipping to just a few of their customers thenext day. It is a beautiful example of the personal one-to-oneselling technique that you want to capture in print, and Schultzhas managed to do this in a very simple and masterful way.
Think also about the nature of grapefruit. This is unquestion-
ably a simple product and this chapter is a good example of my“simple versus complicated” rule. When something is simple,like a grapefruit, you make it complex. If it’s complex, you makeit simple. What could be more simple than a grapefruit? But lookat how Schultz has brought out all the features and the complexi-ties of his selection process and even his own expertise by tellingyou more than you’ve ever wanted to know about grapefruit.
Schultz is now ready for the pitch. The grapefruit could not
get any better. It is rare, it is delicious, it is beautiful and it hasvalue. It’s now up to Schultz to make his customers reach intotheir pockets and exchange their hard-earned dollars for hisgrapefruit, and he makes it as simple as possible.
Frank does this by offering a sample shipment—a low-
priced no-risk opportunity just to try his product. He makes it sosimple that you begin to wonder if he’s going to be ripped off.And what does that signify? That’s right—a satisfaction convic-tion—something that is so compelling, you wonder if people aregoing to take advantage of him.
When I realized that the Royal Ruby Reds were the ultimate
fruit, I decided to form a club and sell only to my club members.In this manner, I can control my production to insure that nobodywill be disappointed.
But before I ask you to join my club, I want you to sample my
Royal Ruby Reds for yourself, at no cost to you whatsoever. Let mesend you a box prepaid of 16 to 20 Royal Ruby Reds. Place four ofthem in your refrigerator until they are thoroughly cool. Then cutthem in half and have your family sample this unusual fruit.
You decide whether or not Royal Ruby Reds are everything I say.
You determine whether or not eating a Royal Ruby Red is thefantastic taste experience I promise.

more of this superb fruit and on a regular basis, too. If the fourRoyal Ruby Reds make you say “yes,” then keep the remainingfruit. Otherwise return the unused fruit (at my expense) and youwon’t owe me a single penny.
But you are never going to know just how wonderful genuine
Royal Ruby Reds are unless you place your order right quick.
This way you are sure to receive your package containing 16 to 20
Royal Ruby Reds for you and your family to sample. But since thesupply is strictly limited it’s important to place your order now.
Note the use of the words “right quick.” That’s the way farm-
ers talk, isn’t it. And it is this homey-sounding copy that capti-vated his audience. In fact, Schultz asked me if he should leave itin. “It isn’t really good English” was his concern. “By all means,leave it in,” I suggested. “It sounds great to me.”
His offer then went on to give the terms of the purchase. The
ﬁrst box was going to cost $5 less than the standard shipment—afurther incentive to at least try his grapefruit. In fact, you actuallydidn’t pay anything up front, as he also included a bill for $9.95.You paid only if you wanted to keep the shipment and you thenwere enrolled in his monthly club. His copy continued:
Now suppose you do like Royal Ruby Reds—suppose you love
them—can you be sure of getting more?
You surely can. By saying “yes” to my ﬁrst shipment you have
the privilege of automatically joining my Winter Fruit Club.Please be assured you pay nothing in advance. But each monthduring the winter, I’ll ship you a pack of 16 to 20 orchard-fresh,hand-selected, hand-picked Royal Ruby Reds.
Every Royal Ruby Red you receive will pass my tough tests.
Each will weigh a pound or more. Safe delivery is guaranteed.This fruit is picked, packed and shipped each month, Decemberthrough April.
You pay only after you have received each shipment. And you can
skip or cancel any shipment, simply by telling me your wishes.
He summarized his offer. He restated most of the points he
told you in the previous copy at the very end of the ad. And thenhe goes into the close:
Remember, it obligates you to nothing except making a taste test
of the best grapefruit that has ever been grown. And this taste testis on me!

Of course, as you can well imagine, when I say supplies are lim-
ited—I’m not kidding! There’s just so many club members I canaccept before I must close my membership this year.
In this statement, he is giving you a sense of urgency that is
both believable and true. Production is limited and getting yourorder in quickly is very important to ensure that you’ll be part ofthe membership program. He also makes it sound risk free andeasy to test.
So to taste this “miracle” grapefruit and have the opportunity to
savor it each month during the growing season, be sure to placeyour order at no obligation, today.
Frank was pleasantly surprised when he ran his test ad in the
Wall Street Journal: “Our cost per order was the lowest of any
outside list we’ve ever used, and I realized that a single advertise-ment held the key to the rapid growth of our company.”
But Frank Schultz didn’t stop there. He continued to advertise
in the Wall Street Journal, theNew York Times, Parade , and TV
Guide , to name only a few. “When you’re a farmer you always
worry about the crop. It’s growing too slow—you worry. It’s grow-ing too fast—you really worry,” said Frank later in a letter to me.
“I ﬁnd it to be about the same when a farmer gets into space
advertising. The orders are coming in so good from our spaceads, I’m beginning to worry. A high-class worry, I’ll admit.”
In December 1980, an article on Schultz appeared in Texas
Monthly magazine. The story talked about his wonderful copy
and how the copy made his business seem small and personal.Yet it also explained that the business was quite large by then.He harvested 26,000 tons of grapefruit in 1979 with only 4 per-cent passing Schultz’s rigorous standards for Royal Ruby Redgrapefruit. The rest were sold to the grocery chains. And he nowhad 80,000 customers in the 48 contiguous states. He owned14,000 acres of orchards spread out from Brownsville toMcAllen, Texas, and had hundreds of employees. He truly was asuccess story—all created from the power of his pen.
And yet, his customers visualized Frank with his picking
ring out in the orchard picking those perfect Royal Ruby Redgrapefruit free of sheep nose and wind scarring.

From time to time, Frank would send me some of the letters
he received complimenting him on his copy. One came from Stan-ley Marcus, then the chairman of Neiman Marcus. Some werefrom other copywriters who recognized his ad as brilliant. And formany years Schultz ran the ads until they ﬁnally wore out.
I myself was in Schultz’s grapefruit club for many years. And
from my orders alone, he probably made back all the money hehad spent on my seminar. If you’d like Royal Ruby Red grapefruitsent directly to your door, call Frank toll free—1-800-477-4773between 8

Victoria’s Secret is now a major chain with 900 stores do-
ing $2.4 billion in sales with a major catalog division thatdoes $870 million by itself. But back in 1979, it consistedof just three small stores and a catalog—all founded by anentrepreneur named Roy Raymond. And that is when Bar-bara Dunlap attended my seminar.
The ad she wrote helps illustrate many of the principles
you’ve learned in this book and also points to a few sheoverlooked. Let’s start with the headline and subheadline. Ifyou were a man or a woman reading through a newspaper,you might stop dead in your tracks if you saw the following:
Headline: Lingerie for Men
Subheadline: How a Group of Very Special Men Made It
All Possible
Note that the headline was just three words—short,
concise and certainly enough to get you to read the sub-headline. Then notice that the subheadline did not giveaway the premise of the ad; you still don’t know what it is.In fact, it might sound like some men got together and made thewearing of lingerie possible. You just don’t know, so you keepreading.
Now read the ﬁrst paragraph, which is in large type and ac-
tually draws you into the copy. Also note the storytelling feel ofthe ﬁrst few paragraphs.
WE WERE ASTOUNDED ! When we opened the doors of our new busi-
ness, we thought most of our customers would be women. After all,beautiful designer lingerie is the kind of luxury a lady can’t resist.
How wrong we were.
That ﬁrst Valentine’s Day, the men came in droves! Hundreds of
men, who had secretly been dying to visit our boutique. At last,they had the perfect excuse—Valentine’s Day gifts for their fa-vorite ladies.
227Lingerie for Men Chapter 25
The ad drew a lot
of attention but
missed a few
major points 
at the end.
======================================== [Página 252] ========================================

They loved the merchandise.
Can you imagine how shocked we were? All those men—milling
about our Victorian boutique. Admiring the silk stockings andlacy garter belts from France. Totally smitten by the luxurioussilk and satin kimonos from London. Crowding around the braand bikini sets from Italy. They couldn’t wait to surprise theirwives or girlfriends with something truly special.
Once again as the story is told you can visualize the scene.
You can almost see the merchandise and appreciate how the vari-ety of merchandise is woven neatly into the story. But now a ques-tion might pop into your mind as you are reading this. And thisvery question is brought into the copy at precisely this moment.
Weren’t they embarrassed?
The truth is, they were. But not enough to keep them away! They
had seen our exciting, full-color catalogue. A breathtaking pic-ture book of beautiful women, wearing enticing creations. Be-sides, a few men became our ﬁrst satisﬁed customers. And in ashort time, they had managed to spread the good word. Victoria’sSecret wasn’t like shopping for lingerie in a department store. Nomatronly saleslady to make a man feel uneasy. No raised eye-brows or pursed lips asking about sizes. No racks of ﬂannel andterrycloth to wade through. And no clunky, plastic boxes over-ﬂowing with boring white foundation garments.
There were a number of good issues just covered. First, Dun-
lap comes across as being truthful when she admits that the menwere embarrassed. In short, she raises an objection in the para-graph heading (“Weren’t they embarrassed?”) and then answers ithonestly. But then she brings in the fact that they were motivatedby a full-color catalog that she refers to as a “breathtaking picturebook.” Here she very subtly brings in the catalog as the motiva-tional factor that prompted all these men to come to the store.
Another objection you might raise if you decided to go to
the store is the store environment itself and the human elementin the store—the salesclerks. If you were a man, would you beembarrassed? Here in this same paragraph (which really shouldhave been a new paragraph) she raises the objection and resolvesit by pointing out that the store has none of the embarrassmentsfound in a department store. In short, this is a store that wouldnot embarrass a man at all.

In this ad, Dunlap ﬁrst got your attention and raised all the
objections that you might have if you were a man and wanted tobuy lingerie for your wife or girlfriend in a women’s lingeriestore. In the next paragraph, Dunlap broadens the market fromjust a few men to all men, similar to the way Karbo broadenedhis income opportunity ad to include anybody interested in bet-tering his or her life. Here’s what she said.
The men in our life.
Since that ﬁrst Valentine’s Day, we’ve learned a lot about our
male customers. Mainly, they can’t be stereotyped. Some areconservative, some far from it. Some are rather old, while othersare much younger. Whether doctors, accountants, salesmen orbankers . . . they all have one thing in common. They are trueconnoisseurs of beauty. They know how sensuous and lovely alacy camisole or elegant gown looks on a woman. And what’smore, they know how wonderful a woman feels to receive some-thing beautiful and intimate from a special man. And it takes avery special man to shop from Victoria’s Secret.
Not only does Dunlap include a broad range of men but she
then compliments the men on their taste and understanding ofwomen in general.
In the next paragraph we ﬁnally get the real pitch of the ad.
Since the only Victoria’s Secret stores were located in northernCalifornia at the time, the real purpose of this ad, which ran na-tionally, was to attract catalog customers from the other 49 states.So after the paragraph heading “Our luxurious photo album . . .”comes the pitch. Note the colorful and sensuous language, whichonly helps to create the environment for this ad.
If you’re like our male patrons—sensuous and fashion-conscious
in your own right—you’ve been dying to ﬁnd a place like Victo-ria’s Secret. However, if you live outside of northern Californiayou won’t ﬁnd it. But for $2.00 you can have the next best thing.Our luscious, full-color catalogue of alluring designer lingerie.
What if you don’t like our style?
We guarantee you’ll be the ﬁrst man who didn’t. But . . . if after you
receive our catalogue, you ﬁnd our fashions too sensuous or tooluxurious for the lady in your life, you haven’t lost a thing. Ourlush, full-color catalogue is an elegant collector’s item—a conver-sation piece your friends will adore! (Already, our customers are re-questing previous editions of the Victoria’s Secret catalogue.)

There was one main problem with this ad, and unfortu-
nately it came at the most critical part—at the end. The objectionsome prospects might raise is, “What if I’m not pleased with the$2 catalog or any of the merchandise?” Nothing was indicatedabout their return policy. And a nice hook could have been to al-low customers to use their $2 investment in buying the catalogtoward the purchase of their ﬁrst order. Or even allowing them$10 toward their ﬁrst order.
From what I understand, the ﬁrst ad was moderately suc-
cessful in bringing in catalog requests, which in turn brought insales. This was a two-step process—to scan the market for possi-ble customers and then make them customers through the cata-log. This is a very good application of a print ad and a goodexample of many of the principles.
The principles that you should particularly pay attention to
are the excellent timing of the objections and how they were re-solved and the beautiful use of words that told a story and cre-ated the perfect environment for the offer. The real offer was thecatalog, but the story that was told gave men permission to getthe catalog and buy from it—a lot less embarrassing than goinginto the store.
“Lingerie for Men” was brief, it was interesting and it
ﬂowed quite nicely. And although its ending could have beenmore compelling and more effective, it brought you through thecopy like a slippery slide all the way to the very end. I wouldhave also added a byline to the ad to make it even more personal. 
The catalog Victoria’s Secret published back in 1979 was a
lot more sensuous than the catalog they put out today. If I had toclassify it, I would say it was an upscale version of a Frederick’sof Hollywood lingerie catalog. And indeed, both catalogs werequite popular with the men.
Two advertising people from Victoria’s Secret attended my
seminar before the franchise was sold to The Limited. The twowomen used their copywriting skills to write the colorful cata-logs. They both claim that the seminar was one of the turning

points in their careers and a major factor in the early success of
Victoria’s Secret. Tragically, Roy Raymond, Victoria Secret’sfounder, committed suicide in 1993 by jumping off the GoldenGate Bridge.
The lesson to be learned from this example is that you can
write a great ad but then miss some important opportunities atthe end. And the end of the ad is when the buying decision has tobe made—it’s a critical point in any advertisement.
In the next chapter, I give you an example of a company
trying to resolve a problem without ﬁrst raising it. It will clarifythe important method of always raising an objection and thenresolving it.

This is a good example of an advertising message that
could have been quite powerful if it weren’t for one fatalﬂaw. Let me explain.
I was ﬂying back from Rockford, Illinois, in my own
private plane. I was about 50 miles from the Pal-Waukeeairport where I was scheduled for an instrument landingeven though the weather was perfect for ﬂying. The airtrafﬁc controllers were unusually quiet as I approachedPal-Waukee. It was a bright clear day—one of those raredays when you could see for miles.
As I got closer to Pal-Waukee, I could see off in the
distance a big ﬁre near Chicago’s O’Hare airport. I landedmy plane, parked and walked into the airport ofﬁce whereI learned from a television broadcast that American Air-lines ﬂight 191 had just crashed on takeoff from O’Hareand that all its passengers had died. That was May 25,1979, and it was one of those memories that remains indeliblyetched in my mind.
The plane that crashed was a DC-10—one of McDonnell
Douglas’s largest and most popular aircraft. Immediately after thecrash, it was determined that there was a hydraulic problem that,under certain circumstances, could cause loss of control and conse-quently a crash. McDonnell Douglas quickly corrected the prob-lem, but for a while all DC-10s were grounded.
If that weren’t enough, the DC-10 was involved in two
more crashes within a relatively short period of time. The lasttwo were unrelated to any fault of the airplane, but the stigma ofthe American Airlines crash was still on the mind of the public.McDonnell Douglas realized that it had to do something to offsetthe negative publicity.
They picked Pete Conrad to act as spokesman in an adver-
tisement to address the public’s concern. But instead of raising the
233The More You Learn Chapter 26
This ad had a
major ﬂaw. The
entire ﬁrst part
was missing.
======================================== [Página 258] ========================================

objections of the plane crashes and then resolving the problem
with the excellent copy that was written, the objection was totallyignored. The resulting ad was hollow. The following is the copy asit was written:
Headline: “The more you learn about our DC-10, the more you
know how great it really is.”
Byline: Pete Conrad, Former Astronaut, Division Vice President,
McDonnell Douglas
Copy: I’ve watched airplanes and spacecraft take shape for much
of my adult life. I’m certain that nothing made to ﬂy has ever beendesigned or built to more exacting standards than our DC-10.
Eighteen million engineering man-hours were invested in this
plane’s development. That includes 14,000 hours of wind tunneltesting, as well as full-scale ‘fatigue testing’ for the equivalent of40 years of airline service.
I’m convinced that the DC-10 is the most thoroughly-tested jet-
liner ever built. Along with U.S. Government certiﬁcation, theDC-10 has passed structure tests just as demanding, in their ownway, as those required of U.S. Air Force ﬁghter planes.
The DC-10 ﬂeet demonstrates its dependability ﬂying more than
a million miles a day and serving 170 cities in 90 countriesaround the globe.
The ad then ended with a place to write McDonnell Dou-
glas to get more information.
The copy was good copy—very persuasive in terms of build-
ing conﬁdence in the plane. And all this was presented by a formerastronaut to add credibility. But it lacked an important opening thatwould have made the copy many times more effective.
What if the ad had started out differently? If I were given
the assignment of writing the ad, here’s the way it would go:
Headline: DC-10’s Big Secret
Subheadline: You’ve heard a lot of bad publicity about the DC-10.
But here’s something you may not have known.
Byline: By Pete Conrad
Copy: It was horrible. When American Airlines ﬂight 191
crashed at O’Hare in Chicago last May 25th, hundreds of peoplelost their lives in what was considered one of the worst planecrashes in American history. The plane—a DC-10.
But as the facts emerged, it was learned that a series of coinci-
dences resulted in a hydraulic malfunction that in all likelihood
234PROVING THE POINTS—AD EXAMPLES
======================================== [Página 259] ========================================

would never happen again. But it did happen. And in the subse-
quent weeks, a series of fail-safe systems were installed that makethe DC-10’s hydraulic system among the safest of any jetliner.
In addition, two other recent crashes of DC-10s were determined
to be totally not the fault of the airplane but of the pilots. But be-cause of the negative publicity generated by the American Air-lines crash and these other two crashes, we have been even morediligent. All airlines are required to give each DC-10 a completeinspection every 50 hours instead of the required 100 hours ofﬂying. The plane’s hydraulic system is checked before each ﬂightinstead of waiting until a required inspection. And the plane’sstructural system is checked not only by each mechanic but bythe pilots themselves. You couldn’t ﬂy a safer plane.
Then I would pick up the copy from the existing ad so it
would continue,
I’ve watched airplanes and spacecraft take shape for much of my
adult life. I’m certain that nothing made to ﬂy has ever been de-signed or built to more exacting standards than our DC-10.
The rest of the original copy would follow. Do you see the
difference? What I have done is to raise the real problem (or as Icall it, the “objection”) and then resolve it. Conrad’s copy, whichcould easily go at the end of my ad, would then contribute to re-solving the problem.
After reading my version of the ad, you would leave with
a positive feeling about both the company and the message.You would think, “That was a sincere effort to dispel thosefalse impressions on the safety of the DC-10.” The message isan emotional presentation that shows concern, integrity andleadership.
Now compare that with the way the ad was originally writ-
ten, which might have left you with the sarcastic impression,“Sure it’s a safe plane . . . .” Or maybe, “They are just trying to
cover themselves from all the heat they’ve been taking.”
Keep in mind that the copy they had was very good. They
just left off the entire front end of the ad and were avoiding thereal issue—the events that actually happened that prompted theirad. They just spent most of their copy resolving the objectionwithout acknowledging and addressing it directly.
235THE MORE YOU LEARN
======================================== [Página 260] ========================================

The lesson to be learned here is to realize the importance
of raising an objection, regardless of how embarrassing ordetrimental it may seem, and then doing your best to resolve it.You’ll ﬁnd that the public really appreciates your candor, honestyand frankness and will respond to your message in a positiveway, whether it be to buy your product, to develop a good feel-ing about your company or, as in the case of the DC-10, to re-store conﬁdence in an airplane.

Even if you never wrote a piece of copy in your life,
one look at this ad from Sony Video Communicationsand you would feel pretty much like the cartoon char-acter shown in it. You’d feel like falling asleep.
The advertising agency that created this ad prob-
ably thought they had a very clever idea. Their con-cept—show the contrast between typical types ofboring communications and a new, more stimulatingvideo presentation (new back in the mid-1970s whenthis ad appeared).
In keeping with the theme, the headline in the ad
was inadvertently boring in that it was hard to readwith its dense capitalized type. The ad layout was bor-ing. And ﬁnally, the copy was monotonous and did notfollow many of my principles. So whoever createdthis ad was certainly being consistent with the themein their presentation. It was boring.
But being consistent while going in the wrong direction is
not a great strategy, either. Very few people would want to read aboring ad. There are thousands of ad messages out there on adaily basis, and to stand out you need a message that grabs peo-ple’s attention and causes them to read your entire ad. And to getthem to read your entire ad, you must use many of the techniquesI’ve presented throughout this book, even if the ad you are creat-ing is not a mail order ad.
In the Sony ad they are ﬁrst trying to sell the concept of us-
ing video and then of using Sony video, once they have con-vinced their reader to try this new medium. My approach wouldhave been to create a story of somebody who switched to videoand saw a dramatic beneﬁt—more sales, greater productivity ormore awareness.
Here are the ﬁrst few paragraphs to give you the sense of
237A More Stimulating Way Chapter 27
The theme of
this ad was
“boring.” They
accomplished
their goal.
======================================== [Página 262] ========================================

how the copy ﬂowed. The ad had no subheadline, no cartoon cap-
tion and started out with a very long and boring ﬁrst sentence.
Every day, American business spews forth a virtually endless
stream of inter-ofﬁce memos, conference reports, training manu-als, brochures, telexes, phone calls, slide shows, letters, telegrams,direct mail pieces, annual reports, press releases and newsletters.
The average employee is deluged with communication.And there is no way of telling how much of it is either ignored,
forgotten, misplaced or summarily disposed of.
In short, American business is in the throes of a vast and complex
communication crisis.
A problem that today—in an age of shortened attention spans and
heightened communications costs—cries out for an efﬁcient andimaginative solution.
The ﬁrst sentence is too long and the copy is boring. But then
again, isn’t “boring” the theme of the ad? (I’m being facetious.)
The ad then tells how video is being used and what Sony
has to offer the new and emerging industry. If you thought theﬁrst few paragraphs were boring, so was the rest of the copy.And since I get bored typing it into my computer for this book,I’m not going to include any more for you to read. Just trustme—it was boring.
Chances are, unless you were totally interested in video
communications and were actively searching for everything youcould ﬁnd on the subject, you wouldn’t even consider readingthe entire ad.
And here’s my ﬁnal point. The ad was created by a profes-
sional ad agency using professional copywriters, layout artists andart directors. After reading this book, you could act as a consultantto that ad agency and improve its advertising by 1,000 percent andyou may not even be a professional anything. The ability to writegood advertising copy is not limited exclusively to professionals.Often even the most inexperienced person can write an incrediblyeffective ad. And certainly after reading this book, you can criti-cize even the most professionally prepared ads.

This JS&A mail order ad for the Magic Stat thermostat
basically tells a story but with a unique twist. The storystarts out with us hating the product, and then as the storyunfolds, the product takes a quantum leap in our approvalto become the best product on the planet. How I get thereis an interesting process.
First I realized that the number one drawback in pur-
chasing a thermostat is the installation. It’s not one of thosethings that consumers relate to. It could be dangerous han-dling all those wires and there’s a lot of extra expense inhaving an installer put one in. So one of the ﬁrst good fea-tures we ﬁnally like in our story is the ease of installation.In short, we recognize that consumers don’t like to be both-ered with installation and we hit this feature early in the ad.
The copy itself raises many objections—the case de-
sign, the look of it and even the name. We realized thatthese would be some of the same objections consumers wouldraise when they looked at the product. And we resolved themone by one as we ﬂoated through the copy.
A good portion of the copy explained in a light sort of way
the features of the product. And then near the end we built up thecompany selling us the product to add credibility and make theconsumer feel more secure. Our competition, after all, was Hon-eywell—a company with an established name and reputation.
The Magic Stat ad ran in print for almost three years start-
ing in 1983 and made the product into a very successful brandname. The company eventually was sold to Honeywell.
The following is the complete text of the ad:
Headline: Magic Baloney
Subheadline: You’ll love the way we hated the Magic Stat ther-
mostat until an amazing thing happened.
239Magic Baloney Chapter 28
I brought out the
worst aspects of
this product and
turned them
around.
======================================== [Página 264] ========================================

Caption: It had no digital readout, an ugly case and a stupid
name. It almost made us sick.
Copy: You’re probably expecting our typical sales pitch, but get
ready for a shock. For instead of trying to tell you what a greatproduct the Magic Stat thermostat is, we’re going to tear it apart.Unmercifully.
When we ﬁrst saw the Magic Stat, we took one look at the name
and went, “Yuck.” We took one look at the plastic case and said,“How cheap looking.” And when we looked for the digital read-out, it had none. So before the salesman even showed us how itworked, we were totally turned off.
REAL LOSER
So there it was—at ﬁrst blush a real loser. But wait, we did ﬁndone good feature—a feature that led us to a discovery. The MagicStat installs in a few minutes and no serviceman is required.Thermostat wires in your wall follow standard color codes. Sowhen you install Magic Stat, you attach the red wire to the red lo-cation and the white to the white. That’s play school stuff. Andit’s safe. Conventional thermostats installed over the past 20years are generally only 24 volts, so you can either turn off thepower or work with the “live” wires without fear.
OK, LET’S TEST IT
The Magic Stat installation was so easy that the least we could dowas test it. And that’s when we made an incredible discovery. Wediscovered that the Magic Stat was probably the most consumer-oriented, technologically-advanced and most sophisticated ther-mostat ever developed on the face of this earth and in our galaxyfor all times ever. What made us switch from hating the thing toloving it? Read the following:
The Magic Stat has six setback settings per day and a seven day
program. That means that you could set it for 70 degrees whenyou get up in the morning, drop the temperature to 54 degreeswhen you go to work, raise it to 68 degrees when you return fordinner, raise it up to 70 degrees after dinner as you watch TV andthen drop it down to 62 degrees when you go to sleep. Countthem—ﬁve settings with one to spare.
In one day the Magic Stat is programmed for the whole week and
for the weeks to come. If you want a different schedule for week-ends, you can individually program the thermostat for thosedays, too. “Big deal,” you might think. “What’s so great aboutthat?” Read on.
You set most electronic setback thermostats to the time you want
the furnace to go on in the morning, so when you wake up, yourroom is once again warm. But what if one morning it’s bitter
240PROVING THE POINTS—AD EXAMPLES
======================================== [Página 265] ========================================

cold outside and the next morning it’s much warmer? This
means that setting your furnace to go on at the same time may,on one morning, leave you cold and on the next morning causeyou to waste energy by warming up your house too soon.
By golly, the Magic Stat has everybody beat on this one too.
Throughout the night it senses and computes the drop in temper-ature and the time it will take to get your room to your exactwake-up temperature. So if you want to wake up at 7 AM to 70degrees—that’s the temperature you’ll wake up to every time.Because it’s a patented concept, no other thermostat has this fea-ture. But wait. There is also a patent on the setting feature.
SIMPLE TO SET
To set the thermostat, you press just one button. A small LEDlight scans the temperature scale until you reach your desiredtemperature and then you release the button. You change the tem-perature naturally, throughout the day, up to six times. The unitresponds and remembers that exact living pattern. The presenttemperature is displayed by a glowing red LED on the scale.
The system also computes the ideal length the furnace should
stay on to keep the temperature within a range of plus or minusone and one-half degrees. A battery backup lets you keep yourstored program in its memory so power outages as long as eighthours won’t let your unit forget. And if something happens andyour power is out for a few days, the unit will automaticallymaintain 68 degrees when the power is restored.
Quite frankly, we were so impressed with the unit, its ease of in-
stallation and setting plus its many energy-saving features, weseriously considered advertising it until we realized that our cus-tomers would probably not want to trust their future comfort to aproduct called Magic Stat. What if something went wrong withthe unit? How substantial was this Magic Stat outﬁt? Remember,a thermostat is something you live with as long as you live inyour home, and they’re supposed to last ages. After all, yourcomfort depends on it.
Well, we did our homework. We found the company to be a
sound, well-ﬁnanced organization. They have been in businessfor several years, and they back their products with a three-yearlimited warranty. In addition, the company has a policy of buyingback your unit in one year if you haven’t saved its full cost in en-ergy savings. We were satisﬁed with the company, the people, theproduct, its incredible features, the company’s commitment tothe product and above all, the energy savings.
We are so impressed now with the Magic Stat that we’re going
to make buying one irresistible. Buy one from us for only $79.

The ad drew your attention and brought you into the copy
with the way I knocked the product. Your question might havebeen, “What’s the gimmick? Why is he knocking the product?”
You started to read the ad. And then you discovered the one
feature that we liked, which happened to be installation—themost difﬁcult obstacle we had to overcome in selling this product.
From then on selling the Magic Stat was all downhill as if
on a slippery slide. Once we had the product installed, we couldthen discover its great features, raise and resolve the remainingobjections (the name and the appearance) and then sell all theproduct’s beneﬁts. And indeed we did for more than three years.

At JS&A we had three corporate aircraft. Like having
a lot of cars, you can ﬂy only one airplane at a time. SoI decided to get rid of the plane I used the least—myAerostar.
I paid close to $240,000 for it and everybody told
me that it was now worth only $190,000 at best. Icouldn’t believe this ﬁne aircraft had dropped so muchin value, so I decided to take out a single ad in theAOPA Pilot —one of the private pilot magazines—and
ﬁnd out if I could get my asking price.
The basic format of the ad was a story about my
lack of use of the airplane and my concern for our me-chanic/pilot Dave. And I use the story to weave in all thegood features of the plane. Then, at the end, to add a littlehumor, I offered to give away a small steer to anybodywho buys the plane. I ﬁnished the ad with a classic end-ing. In this ad the humor worked. My Aerostar sold quickly for$240,000—I got back exactly what I paid for it minus the cost ofthe ad, around $5,000. It was well worth the effort. Humor canwork if it is done in a friendly sort of way. In essence I was pokingfun at myself, but the serious message of the ad didn’t get over-looked. And, remember, I only needed to sell one to break even.

I bought 296PA in April of 1978. It was one of the last ones pro-
duced by Ted Smith before Piper bought the company. I alsohired a full-time mechanic, Dave, who did nothing but keep theship gleaming and in perfect ﬂying condition.

They said I’d

but it took only

======================================== [Página 268] ========================================

Instead of ﬂying the Aerostar, Dave and I ended up ﬂying the
other corporate planes—our Grumman Tiger and our BeechcraftBonanza—while the Aerostar was hangared, polished and look-ing pretty.
In two full years, Dave and I have only put 350 hours on our pet
plane—a lot less time than can justify owning this ﬁne ship.
DAVE IS A FARMER
Dave is also a farmer. In his early years he plowed the ﬁelds andmilked cows at his parents’ farm in Illinois. Dave has alwaysloved the farm—almost as much as Dave loves ﬂying.
In July of this year, Dave and I were talking. We weren’t using
the Aerostar enough to justify keeping it, yet Dave, a loyal, hard-working and excellent mechanic, would not have enough to keephim busy to continue working for JS&A if we sold it and he onlyhad the other two planes to work on.
I personally love ﬂying too. I am an instrument-rated commercial
pilot with a multi-engine rating. Unlike Dave, I was born in thebig city. I didn’t know what it was like to raise crops or work ona farm.
DAVE GETS THE WORD
I sat Dave down and told him that I was planning to sell 296PAand I asked him if he wouldn’t mind going back to the farm. Myidea was simply to buy a farm with the proceeds from the sale ofthe Aerostar, put in a landing strip and a small hangar, and Daveand his family could raise crops while he wasn’t working on theother two planes.
Dave loved the idea, so I decided to part with our Aerostar and
offer it for sale in this advertisement.
296PA is a fully pressurized light twin that gets an amazing 28
gallons per hour at a realistic cruise speed of 200 knots. It wasaerodynamically designed to take jet engines, but its designersettled for two 290 HP Lycoming engines which provide greatspeed and fuel efﬁciency.
ADVANCED AVIONICS
The avionics on the airplane remind me of many of the ﬁne prod-ucts our company sells. The fully computerized Bendix 2000system includes radar, R-Nav, DME, a radar altimeter plus all the goodies we could possibly put on the beautiful panel. There’san auxiliary hydraulic pump, surface de-ice plus a ﬂight phone.The plane had to be fully equipped—after all, my reputation de-manded it.
A comparably equipped 1980 Aerostar currently sells for over
$350,000 and doesn’t look nearly as pretty.

Our Aerostar was a Ted Smith original—built by dedicated
craftsmen who took great pride in their work. But with any newplane, there are always small bugs that surface. The JS&AAerostar is so debugged that we doubt you’ll see one soon. Davespent an enormous amount of time tightening, greasing, cleaningand examining every system in the plane. In addition to 100 hourinspections, Dave conducted 50 hour inspections. In addition toyearly inspections, Dave conducted semi-annual inspections.And if I mentioned I heard a strange creak on the plane, Davewould be there for days decreaking the plane.
In short, 296PA is a beautiful, fully-equipped airplane that has
been hangared and well taken care of for its short two-year life.And it’s for sale.
JS&A is offering our 601P for only $240,000 complete (sales tax
has already been paid on the plane) plus no postage or handling.It’s a genuine bargain that really has to be seen to be appreciated.Dave hangars the plane at the Waukegan airport, north ofChicago, and would be happy to arrange a showing. Simply callour toll-free number below to set up an appointment.
If you’re not interested in our Aerostar but would like one of
our most recent catalogs, call us on our toll-free number or dropus a line too. JS&A is America’s largest single source of space-age products and I’d be anxious to have fellow pilots as ourcustomers.
Dave has been looking at a lot of farms lately and is really ex-
cited about getting back into farming. And, of course, I’m anx-ious to sell my Aerostar so I could own a farm and keep a loyalemployee happy and productive.
And if somebody purchases my Aerostar from this ad, I’ll also
throw in, free of charge, a steer from our new farm. After all, asany airplane salesman will tell you, it’s hard to sell a plane with-out a little bull. Call early and see my Aerostar, today.
As I mentioned, the plane sold very quickly. And for the
asking price. It was only later, after a call from the FBI, that Idiscovered the plane was used for running drugs from SouthAmerica and had been conﬁscated.

After my success with the airplane, I had a chance to
really push the mail order envelope. Could I sell a $6million home? The exposure might ﬁnd one buyer—just as it did with my airplane—and all I needed wasone buyer.
So in 1987 I created the ad as a complete story
almost all the way to the end. The marketing strategywas to offer the house or a video. If the house didn’tsell, maybe I would sell enough videos to cover thespace costs. But I didn’t sell enough videos and the adwas a loss, as the house did not sell, either.

Copy: Have I got a deal. And even if you don’t buy this home,
you’ll love the story.
It all started with an invitation. I was invited by one of the top real
estate developers in the country to attend a party at his home inMalibu, California. I didn’t know why. All the developer wouldsay is, “Just come.”
The jet was waiting for me at O’Hare Airport in Chicago and his
chauffeur-driven limousine met me at Los Angeles for the driveto Malibu. It was class all the way.
When I drove up to the home, there was a party going on. Rolls-
Royces were lined up everywhere and the noise and music fromthe house made it clear that something special was going on.
VERY FAMOUS GUESTS
After I entered and was introduced to the host and his wife, theytook me around and introduced me to some of their guests. “This

And even 
Japanese yen.
======================================== [Página 272] ========================================

is Joe Sugarman, that famous mail order copywriter who writes
all those interesting mail order ads.”
I met a famous movie star, a nationally famous sports broad-
caster, a soap opera TV star, a few famous baseball players andtwo famous California politicians. I recognized everybody and afew even knew who I was. In fact, some of them were my cus-tomers. But why was I there? I still didn’t know.
I had a chance to look around the house. Now I’ve seen beautiful
homes in my life but this one had to be the most impressive I’veever seen. First, it was on top of a 90 foot bluff overlooking a sandybeach and the Paciﬁc Ocean. Secondly, it was night and I could seethe entire shoreline of Los Angeles. It was as if I were on a cruiseship at sea and I could look over the Paciﬁc and back at the city.
Then I recognized the cliff. Was this the site of the most publi-
cized wedding in show business where seven helicopters hoveredabove taking pictures? I found out later that it was.
The home took complete advantage of the view. Practically every
room faced the ocean. And the sliding glass doors completelyopened so you had an unobstructed view of the ocean—no parti-tions, no supporting beams.
The sound that ﬁlled the house with music ﬁrst appeared to be
live. But later I found that the home had the best acoustics everdesigned into a personal residence with a sound system that ri-valed a recording studio. And what a personal residence.
There was a sunken tennis court, a swimming pool, whirlpool
bath and solid state electronic lighting system that was controlledfrom any place in the house. The ceilings were 25 feet high andthe interior decor was so tastefully done that I could easily under-stand why it won all sorts of awards. But why was I here? Whywere all my expenses paid for? Then I found out.
The developer and his wife set me up in one of the ﬁve bedrooms
and after the guests had left invited me into the living room. “Joe,the reason we’ve invited you here is that we want you to write anadvertisement to sell our house. You’re one of the nation’s topcopywriters, and since this house is an award-winning world-classresidence, we wanted a world-class copywriter to do it justice.”
Now I’ll admit, I was ﬂattered. “But I’m a mail order copywriter.
How could I possibly sell a house this expensive?”
VERY SPECIAL
“Easy,” replied the developer. “By its value. This property is veryspecial. It’s on a peninsula that sticks out of the curved part thatfaces Los Angeles. When you look from the cliff you see Los An-geles as if it were rising out of the ocean. And because we are on

a point, we do not get the harsh winds off the ocean but rather
gentle breezes all year long. The property itself is so valuablethat our next door neighbor paid close to 9 million dollars for hisone bedroom house.”
I was starting to feel uneasy. “I’m sorry, but there’s no way I can
sell your home. I refuse to write anything except under my owncompany name. And I’m not in the real estate business.” But thedeveloper persisted.
“Joe, you really can be. This house is an investment. There’s a lot
of foreign money out there. And all it takes is that special personlooking for a celebrity-status world-class home on one of the bestsites in America and presto, it’s sold.”
FINAL REFUSAL
I refused and it was my ﬁnal refusal. “I’m sorry, I cannot sellanything without a 30 day return privilege. My customers allhave the opportunity to return anything we sell them for a promptand courteous refund. And then there’s the credit card issue. Wemake it easy for them to purchase with either Master Card, Visaor American Express.”
Well, the rest is history. I am indeed offering the house for sale.
Please call me at (312) 564-7000 and arrange for a personalshowing. Then I urge you to buy it. We accept Visa, Master Card,American Express, American dollars, Japanese Yen or any nego-tiable hard currency.

The developer and his wife are thrilled that I am selling their
home. They realize that the mail order business is a lot differentthan the real estate business and are willing to compromise. Butdon’t you compromise.

Some of my ads were never even published. Others
were not that successful and some appeared only inour catalog. From this last group I have selected onethat I felt struck out in a very unique direction and hadan interesting story. Hungarian Conspiracy appearedonly in our catalog and was moderately successful. Itwas, however, one of my favorites.
I actually traveled to Hungary, did all the photogra-
phy in Budapest and even met with Professor Erno Ru-bik, the inventor of Rubik’s Cube—a three-dimensionalpuzzle in the shape of a cube that was a fad in theearly 1980s.
What was unique in this ad was the message.
Consumers were urged not to buy the product througha tongue-in-cheek explanation of why purchasing onecould cause another major recession. It is only in the last para-graph of the ad that I actually offer the product for sale.
Keep in mind that when this was written in 1983, we still
had the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union with all the associatedparanoia.
The environment created in the ad for the product is both a
story and a tease. “What’s the gimmick here if they aren’t sellingthe product?” is one of the questions you might ask yourself asyou slowly slip through the copy. And you don’t get the answeruntil the very last paragraph. What do you think of the ad copy?

BUDAPEST (JS&A)—Reporters have smuggled intelligence re-
ports out of Hungary on a conspiracy that may have far-reachingconsequences for all Americans.
In the coming year, Hungarians will be shipping to the United
States, via Hong Kong, a game with the code name “XL-25.”
The game at ﬁrst may look innocuous—a typical electronic game
that could come from Mattel, or any of the other big electronicgame manufacturers. But beware. Whatever you do, don’t buy it.
MASSIVE CONSPIRACY
The game is part of a massive conspiracy to weaken the UnitedStates by destroying our productive work force and eventuallyputting the entire free world into a major depression. Here’s whatwe’ve discovered.
In 1980 when Erno Rubik, the Budapest University professor,
unleashed the now famous Rubik’s Cube, the United States econ-omy was growing at a nice clip. Shortly after the cube was intro-duced, America entered into a major recession. Our grossnational product dropped, factories started laying off people bythe thousands and the economy took a big nosedive.
The exact reasons for the recession are varied, but our theory is
quite simple. JS&A contends that millions of Americans were sobusy twisting that small cube that they were not paying attentionto their jobs. Productivity dropped, proﬁts plunged and consumerspending fell to new lows.
It was obvious to Russian intelligence sources that the cause of
the American recession was the Rubik’s Cube. The Russians rea-soned that if the Hungarians could invent games and then ﬂoodthe American market with them, they could cause a massive de-pression—one that would permanently weaken America thusmaking us easy targets for a communist takeover. If you thinkthis theory is farfetched, please read on.
THANK YOU
Hungarians everywhere, proud of the huge success of the Ru-bik’s Cube, were now inspired. Hungarians are quite a creativebunch to start with. They were responsible for such things asglass ﬁber optics, the micro ﬂoppy disk and the science of holog-
252PROVING THE POINTS—AD EXAMPLES
======================================== [Página 277] ========================================

raphy. Hungary always had creative people, but their potential
was never really unleashed until Rubik.
The Hungarian government wanted to not only encourage this
pent-up creativity, but help Hungary develop their game industryfor speciﬁc communist purposes.
A new private company was set up last year for the sole purpose
of developing computer games for the American market. Fundedby banks and run by successful Budapest business types, thecompany developed the XL-25 through the efforts of three gamedesigners shown to the left.
The bearded communist shown in the picture is Laszlo Mero, 33,
a winner of the 1968 International Mathematical StudentOlympiad held in Moscow. He’s bright, intelligent and one of thetop puzzle and game designers in Hungary.
AUTO PARTS DEALER
The man in the middle is Thomas Kovacs, a Hungarian auto partsdealer. At least that’s what our investigators turned up. We sus-pect auto parts is only a front.
The man to the left is Ferenc Szatmari, a physicist and a real ge-
nius. He graduated from the University of Budapest with a doc-torate degree in elementary particle physics.
The incredible game they invented and the one we must stop from
being sold in this country is quite fascinating. The XL-25 is an elec-tronic game with ﬁve rows of ﬁve squares or 25 squares in all. Eachsquare is actually a button with a built-in light-emitting diode.
When you start, lights light up under ﬁve of the buttons. The ob-
ject of the puzzle is to get all the lights under the buttons to lightup. But there’s a catch, and here’s where the frustration comes in.
Each time you press a button, the four buttons immediately sur-
rounding the button you push change state. If they’re lit, theygo off. If they’re off, they’ll go on. If you’re a little confused, itdoesn’t matter anyway. Just remember that the object of thegame is to get all the buttons to light up with the least numberof keystrokes.
The unit counts the number of button entries and you can ask the
XL-25 what your score is and still return to your game.
Once you try the XL-25, you’ll be immediately sucked into the
Hungarian conspiracy. But don’t worry. You’re in good company.Texas Instruments was so impressed with its design that they de-veloped the integrated circuit. A group in Hong Kong became soobsessed with it that they built the game with the quality you’dexpect from a Mattel or Atari game.
253HUNGARIAN CONSPIRACY
======================================== [Página 278] ========================================

Quite frankly, we were so hooked that we bought thousands and
even dispatched a reporter to Budapest where we made ourshocking intelligence discovery.
YOU CAN HELP
So there’s the story. A communist game, whose circuit was de-signed by a good ol’ American company, carefully assembled byone of our best friends in the Far East—all part of a massive con-spiracy to prepare Americans for a major communist takeover.
Prevent other Americans from falling into this scam. Order a unit
from JS&A. When you receive it, whatever you do, don’t playwith it. Instead, immediately take it to all your neighbors andurge them not to buy one. Tell them about the real cause of ourlast recession, the communist plot and the Hungarian conspiracy.And then make sure you give them the ultimate warning. “Any-body who buys this thing is a real idiot.”

The Vision Breakthrough advertisement was among
the most successful in my company’s history, so itmerits a close look.
In this ad I did not want to present the product as
another pair of sunglasses, so I presented it as a visionbreakthrough that protects you from the harmful rays ofthe sun. It was one of the ﬁrst ads that provided a realeducational message about the dangers of ultraviolet(UV) rays on the eyes. Before this ad ran, there was re-ally nothing in the popular press about UV ray damage.
The approach I used was to tell the story of how I
discovered the glasses and all the facts I learned aboutthem as well as the sun’s light. I did it in a simple yetpowerful way.
I also used a tremendous dose of curiosity. You
can’t experience the pair unless you personally try themon. Thus, you must buy them to satisfy your curiosity.
The BluBlocker advertising campaign was a major success
that started with this print ad in 1986 and continued on televisionfor several years. Today BluBlocker is a recognized brand namethat is sold in retail stores throughout the country.

will be well rewarded. If you don’t believe me, I will make itworth your while to change your mind. Let me explain.
Len is a friend of mine who knows good products. One day 
he called excited about a pair of sunglasses he owned. “It’s so

incredible,” he said, “when you ﬁrst look through a pair, you
won’t believe it.”
“What will I see?” I asked. “What could be so incredible?”Len continued, “When you put on these glasses, your vision im-
proves. Objects appear sharper, more deﬁned. Everything takeson an enhanced 3-D effect. And it’s not my imagination. I justwant you to see for yourself.”
COULDN’T BELIEVE EYES
When I received the sunglasses and put them on I couldn’t be-lieve my eyes. I kept taking them off and putting them on to seeif what I was seeing was indeed actually sharper or if my imagi-nation was playing tricks on me. But my vision improved. It wasobvious. I kept putting on my $100 pair of sunglasses and com-paring them. They didn’t compare. I was very impressed. Every-thing appeared sharper, more deﬁned and indeed had a greaterthree dimensional look to it. But what did this product do thatmade my vision so much better? I found out.
The sunglasses (called BluBlockers) ﬁlter out the ultraviolet and
blue spectrum light waves from the sun. Blue rays have one ofthe shortest wavelengths in the visible spectrum (red is thelongest). As a result, the color blue will focus slightly in front ofthe retina, which is the “focusing screen” in our eye. By blockingthe blue from the sunlight through a special ﬁltration process andonly letting those rays through that indeed focus clearly on theretina, objects appear to be sharper and clearer.
The second reason is even more impressive. It is harmful to have
ultraviolet rays fall on our eyes. Recognized as bad for skin, UVlight is worse for eyes and is believed to play a role in many oftoday’s eye diseases.
SUNGLASS DANGER
But what really surprised me was the danger in conventional sun-glasses. Our pupils close in bright light to limit the light enteringthe eye and open wider at night like the lens of an automatic cam-era. So when we put on sunglasses, although we reduce theamount of light that enters our eyes, our pupils open wider and weallow more of the harmful blue and ultraviolet light into our eyes.
DON’T BE CONFUSED
I’m often asked by people who read this, “Do those BluBlock-ers really work?” They really do and please give me the op-portunity to prove it. I guarantee each pair of BluBlockers to
perform exactly as I described.
BluBlocker sunglasses use Malenium™ lenses with a hard anti-
scratch coating. No shortcuts were taken.

The main feature of this ad is the storytelling approach,
which wove an educational message—the ﬁrst of its kind. Itbrought the awareness of the dangers of sunlight to the attentionof the public who were unaware of these dangers.
In addition, it launched the BluBlocker brand name and
created a new business, which continues to this day over 20 yearslater. It is a perfect example of the power of the pen—the samepower you will have upon completion of this book.

This was the ad that created a lot of controversy
when it appeared in our catalog in 1978. A number ofwomen complained vehemently. It is a good exampleof the insensitivity to women’s issues that I had at thetime. But, hey. I’m human and I learned.
I also received a lot of mail congratulating me on
the incredible piece of copy that I had written. So forits controversial response and for the sake of present-ing some interesting and entertaining copy, I have in-cluded it here.
Another interesting factor was the timing of this
ad. When we placed it in our catalog, prices for goldwere pretty low. Right after the ad appeared, the priceof gold skyrocketed, the response grew like crazy andwe sold out. So it proved to be quite a successful ad,too—but probably due to the serendipity of our timing.
Notice the use of the editorial “we” in the ad copy. It
would have been more personal had I used the word “I” in-stead. Also see if there is one place in the ad that might offenda woman currently employed in a primarily male job category.
Headline: Gold Space Chains
Subheadline: Dress her in style for that next trip through outer
space with America’s ﬁrst space-age gold chains.
Copy: Our good friend, Bob Ross, is one of America’s top
wholesale jewelry representatives.
A few months ago, Bob approached us with a suggestion, “Why
not offer gold chains to your customers?” We rejected the idea,for our catalog must only contain products that relate to space-age technology. And besides, it was too late; we had just passedour deadline.
But Bob persisted, “Most of your readers are men. Why not give
them something they could buy for their wives or loved ones?
259Gold Space Chains Chapter 33
This controversial
ad was a complete
departure from our
normal offerings.
======================================== [Página 284] ========================================

After all, you offer them all sorts of neat things to buy for them-
selves, but other than a good watch, there’s nothing for the lady.”
SUGGESTION REJECTED
We could not accept Bob’s argument. Although we have a 90%male readership, and although we felt that our customers mightindeed want to buy jewelry from our catalog, we felt that ourstrict adherence to the principles of space-age product selectionprecluded our making any variation in our philosophy.
Then Bob tried to appeal to our sense of proﬁt. “Your customers
are wealthy and smart. Offer them gold chains at very low prices.You’ll sell a ton because they have the money to spend, and theyhave the brains to recognize good value.”
Again we had to disappoint Bob. True, our customers earn an av-
erage of $50,000 a year, higher than practically any other buyinggroup in the country. And true, our customers include some ofthe nation’s leading businessmen, politicians, newscasters, doc-tors, and even movie stars. But we could not justify the violationof our principles and take advantage of an opportunity just be-cause our customers are above average. “Sorry Bob,” we said.“JS&A has an important reputation to maintain.”
HE DOESN’T GIVE UP
Bob is quite a successful salesman. He never gives up until hehas exhausted all arguments. A good salesman is persistent, andBob certainly persisted. He just wouldn’t give up.
“Why don’t you call the gold chains ‘Space Chains’—space-age
jewelry for the lady you want to take on that trip through outerspace? After all, giving it a space-age theme really makes it tienicely into your catalog, and besides, gold is a valuable metalfound on many of the planets in outer space.”
“That would be deceiving,” we told Bob. To think that we could
use a ﬂimsy theme like that to tie such an unrelated product tospace-age technology was almost an insult. It was at this point thatwe thought seriously of asking Bob to leave. “Bob, you’re a niceguy and we’ve known you for years, but you’ll have to leave now.”
ENTER BOB’S COUSIN
But Bob pleaded, “Let me show you one thing before I leave. Mycousin Joy is very pretty, and I’m sure she would be happy tomodel the jewelry for you in your advertisement.” Bob then tooka photograph from his wallet and showed it to us.
At this point, Bob had worn out his welcome. We were surprised
to discover that he would stoop so low as to use one of his rela-tives as a means of getting his products displayed in our catalog.But then we gave the whole matter some very serious thought.
260PROVING THE POINTS—AD EXAMPLES

“Actually Bob, space-age jewelry isn’t a bad idea for our catalog.
After all, the only items we have for women are watches. GoldSpace Chains might go very well. Of course we would keep ourprices low to provide some real bargains, and I’m sure our cus-tomers would appreciate the convenience of being able to buysuch a valuable gift. Bob, can she be at our photographer Tues-day so we can make our extended deadline?”
“Sure,” said Bob. “But what about the selection?”“Who cares about the selection? Why don’t you just pick the
most popular styles in various price ranges, and we’ll have thosephotographed too.”
Bob left quickly. He selected the chains and his cousin is shown
above.
We did keep our prices considerably less than any jewelry store
or catalog discount showroom. In fact, if you have a chance, youmight compare. Or compare them after you receive the chains.14 carat gold makes a nice gift for any lady and with our space-age theme, what a combination!
Bob’s a funny guy. He probably thinks he’s quite a salesman. Ac-
tually, if it weren’t for our open-mindedness, our keen ability torecognize outstanding new space-age-oriented products, and ourcompelling desire to satisfy the needs of our customers, Bobwouldn’t have a chance.
[Prices were then listed for different styles on the order form. ]
In the above ad, I mentioned that our customers earn, on av-
erage, $50,000 a year. In 1978 when this ad was written, a$50,000 salary was very high.
Did you ﬁnd the offending passages? What could I have
said that would have made it less offensive without changing thebasic premise of the ad? And what was the premise of the ad?Let me answer this last question.
The premise of the ad was to introduce a product that had
nothing to do with our product line and could not be justiﬁed as an offering in our catalog—unless we created a very strongreason for including it. The strong reason was Bob’s beautifulcousin, Joy, who agreed to model the jewelry for us. After all, wewere human and Joy was a beautiful girl.
As I mentioned, the ad did quite well but it was primarily
because of the dramatic increase in the price of gold right afterour catalog was published.

This ad was one of the best examples of the slippery
slide theory. If you just read the headline, subheadlineand the bold “Impossible-to-trace Guarantee,” youwould be compelled to read the ﬁrst sentence.
Once you started to read, you wouldn’t be able to
stop until you reached the end of the copy. It was ahighly effective piece of advertising copy that I wrotein 1976.
This was one of my favorite ads in that it was
not the typical JS&A ad. In the JS&A ads I was theexpert in space-age products. In the ConsumersHero ad I was a consumer advocate speaking thelanguage of the consumer. It showed that I couldwrite copy for two totally diverse businesses. Eachad had its own set of expressions and method of de-livery. It was also a good example of relating in ahuman way without being humorous. It remains one of mypersonal favorites.
Headline: HOT
Subheadline: A new consumer concept lets you buy stolen mer-
chandise if you’re willing to take a risk.
Copy: We developed an exciting new consumer marketing con-
cept. It’s called “stealing.” That’s right, stealing!
Now if that sounds bad, look at the facts. Consumers are being
robbed. Inﬂation is stealing our purchasing power. Our dollars are shrinking in value. The poor average consumer is plundered,robbed and stepped on.
So the poor consumer tries to strike back. First, he forms con-
sumer groups. He lobbies in Washington. He ﬁghts price in-creases. He looks for value.
So we developed our new concept around value. Our idea was to
steal from the rich companies and give to the poor consumer,save our environment and maybe, if we’re lucky, make a buck.

reading this ad,

A MODERN DAY ROBIN HOOD
To explain our concept, let’s take a typical clock radio retailing
for $39.95 at a major retailer whose name we better not mentionor we’ll be sued. It costs the manufacturer $9.72 to make. Themanufacturer sells the unit to the retailer for $16.
THE UNCLE HENRY PROBLEM
Let’s say that retailer sells the clock radio to your Uncle Henry.Uncle Henry brings it home, turns it on and it doesn’t work. SoUncle Henry trudges back to the store to exchange his “lousy rot-ten” clock radio for a new one that works (“lousy” and “rotten”are Uncle Henry’s words).
Now, the defective one goes right back to the manufacturer along
with all the other clock radios that didn’t work. And if this majorretail chain sells 40,000 clock radios with a 5% defective rate,that’s 2,000 “lousy rotten” clock radios.
CONSUMERS PROTECTED ALREADY
Consumers are protected against ever seeing these products againbecause even if the manufacturer repairs them, he can’t recyclethem as new units. He’s got to put a label on the product clearlystating that it is repaired, not new and if Uncle Henry had his waythe label would also say that the product was “lousy” and “rotten.”
It’s hard enough selling a new clock radio, let alone one that is
used. So the manufacturer looks for somebody willing to buy hisbad product for a super fantastic price. Like $10. But who wantsa clock radio that doesn’t work at any price!
ENTER CONSUMERS HERO
We approach the manufacturer and offer to steal that $39.95 ra-dio for $3 per unit. Now think of it. The manufacturer has al-ready spent $9.72 to make it, would have to spend another $5 inlabor to ﬁx and repackage it, and still would have to mark theunit as having been previously used. So he would be better offselling it to us for $3, taking a small loss and getting rid of his de-fective merchandise.
Consumers Hero is now sitting with 2,000 “lousy rotten” clock
radios in its warehouse.
Here comes the good part. We take that clock radio, test it, check it
and repair it. Then we life test it, clean it up, replace anything thatmakes the unit look used, put a new label on it and presto—a$39.95 clock radio and it only costs us $3 plus maybe $7 to repair it.
Impossible-to-trace Guarantee
We guarantee that our stolen products will look like brand
new merchandise without any trace of previous brand identi-
ﬁcation or ownership.
264PROVING THE POINTS—AD EXAMPLES
======================================== [Página 289] ========================================

We take more care in bringing that clock radio to life than the
original manufacturer took to make it. We put it through moretests, more ﬁne tuning than any repair service could afford. Weget more out of that $10 heap of parts and labor than even themost quality-conscious manufacturer. And we did our bit forecology by not wasting good raw materials.
NOW THE BEST PART
We offer that product to the consumer for $20—the same prod-uct that costs us $3 to steal and $7 to make work. And we make$10 clear proﬁt. But the poor consumer is glad we made ourproﬁt because:
1) We provide a better product than the original version.2) The better product costs one half the retail price.3) We are nice people.
BUT THERE’S MORE
Because we are so proud of the merchandise we refurbish, we of-
fer a longer warranty. Instead of 90 days (the original warranty),we offer a ﬁve-year warranty.
So that’s our concept. We recycle “lousy rotten” garbage into su-
per new products with ﬁve-year warranties. We steal from therich manufacturers and give to the poor consumer. We work hardand make a glorious proﬁt.
To make our concept work, we’ve organized a private membership
of quality and price-conscious consumers and we send bulletins tothis membership about the products available in our program.
Items range from microwave ovens to TV sets to clock radios, digi-
tal watches, and stereo sets. There are home appliances from toast-ers to electric can openers. Discounts generally range between 40and 70 percent off the retail price. Each product has a considerablylonger warranty than the original one and a two week money-backtrial period. If you are not absolutely satisﬁed, for any reason, returnyour purchase within two weeks after receipt for a prompt refund.
Many items are in great abundance but when we only have a few
of something, we select, at random, a very small number ofmembers for the mailing. A good example was our $39.95 TV set(we had 62 of them) or a $1 AM radio (we had 1,257). In short,we try to make it fair for everybody without disappointing amember and returning a check.

Since the time I wrote the Consumers Hero ad I have written
many different ads for many different companies. The point Iwish to make is simply this: A good copywriter can write to ﬁtany market. His or her ads can sound very upscale for one clientand then very downscale for the next. Simply by understandingand applying the principles, one can rise to any copywriting chal-lenge—through understanding the jargon of the customer and us-ing the appropriate words that will resonate with that customer.
266PROVING THE POINTS—AD EXAMPLES
======================================== [Página 291] ========================================

Imagine writing an ad with dozens of misspelled words
and bad grammar and running it in the Wall Street Jour-
nal. That’s exactly what I did in what was one of my
most unusual advertising approaches. 
I was presented with a closeout product. The Nau-
tilus Lower Back machine had stopped selling at retail.As a result, the manufacturer, loaded with inventory,decided to liquidate the entire load to one of the bartercompanies in New York.
There was only one proviso in the closeout sale.
The manufacturer did not want the product offered at adiscount because it would embarrass his retailers whosold customers this product at its full retail price. “If ithad to be advertised, it had to be at the full retail price,”was the directive from the barter company representa-tive who called me on the phone.
The product was going to cost me only around $100. And I
could easily sell it for $250 and make a nice proﬁt. But I was be-ing forced to offer it for $485. If it died at retail, chances wereslim to none that I could sell any at $485.
So I created a novel strategy. I would offer the product at
$500, even more than the full retail price. I would then allowreaders of the ad to circle any misspelled words and I wouldgive them $10 off the retail price for each misspelled wordthey found. I could then misspell 25 words and sell the ma-chine for $250 without creating a problem with my vendor.Nobody except the buyer would know the actual price eachmachine sold for, as it depended on the spelling skills of myreaders.
So in June of 1985, I ran the following ad. I had fun writing
it—purposely misspelling words as well as using bad grammar.
267Nautilus Spelling Sale Chapter 35
There were 25
misspelled words
in this ad and
some pretty bad
grammar.
======================================== [Página 292] ========================================

Read the ad and see how you would have done in the Nautilus
Spelling Sale.
Headline: Nautilus Spelling Sale
Subheadline: Every mispelled word you ﬁnd in this advertisement
is worth $10 towards the purchase of this popular exercise product.
Bold Copy:
Americans have two weaknesses. The ﬁrst is spelling and the
second is in our lower backs. JS&A intends to do something
about both problems.
Byline: By Joseph Sugarman, President
Copy: This advertisment has several mispelled words. Some of
them are intentionally mispelled and others are because myspelling is pretty lousy. (My grammar’s bad too.)
For every mispelled word you ﬁnd in this advertisment, I’ll re-
duce the price of the product shown here by $10. If you ﬁnd 10words mispelled, you get $100 off the price. If you ﬁnd 25 wordsmispelled, you get $250 off the price. And if you ﬁnd 50 wordsmispelled, you get the product for absolutely nothing. Why suchgenerosity?
TOO COSTLY
Hundreds of retailers throughout the country have been sellingthe Nautilus Lower Back machine for its full retail price of $485.Nautilus designed it for the consumer market. Their $3,000 hos-pital version, used for rehabilitation purposes, was too costly forthe average consumer.
So Nautilus designed one for the home and sold thousands. Then
JS&A got hold of a few thousand and felt that an entirely newmarket would develope if the unit could sell for $250 or less. Butthe manufacturer would obviously be concerned as the machinewould upset those who had sold the unit for its full price.
So by running this special sale and listing the full retail price and
with nobody really knowing what price we’re really offering theunit for anyway (I told you my grammar wasn’t good), we canmake everybody happy—especially those of you with goodspelling skills and with lower backs you want to strengthen. Therules are really quite simple.
THE RULES
Look through this ad trying to ﬁnd several mispelled words. Circleeach mispelled word you ﬁnd and put the total number of mis-pelled words in the circle above. Please don’t correct my grammar.Then multiply the number of mispelled words by $10 and thendeduct that amount from the $500 price show in this advertisment.

======================================== [Página 293] ========================================

We promise to deliver a unit to you for the price you earn. But be
careful. If you circle a word that is not mispelled, we reserve theright to return your order and have you arrested. All orders must bemailed in and paid for by check or money order. (We can’t affordthe credit card charges, and COD’s are more bother than they areworth and at this price we don’t need the extra espense.)
If you just want to enter this sale without purchasing anything,
simply send the ad in with the number in the circle. If you guessthe correct number of mispelled words, you will get a $10 credittowards all the products listed in our catalog which we will alsosend you (not all the products, just our catalog).
There are a few disclamers. We only have a few thousand of
these machines so we reserve the right to run out of them. Wealso reserve the right to return any order that claims more mis-pelled words than we’ve actually made. We will ship each unitfreight collect with charges usually running around $50 east ofthe Mississippi or a little more in California. And ﬁnally, a littleclue. There are three mispelled words in this paragraph.
DESIGNED FOR THE LOWER BACK
The Nautilus Lower Back machine is designed to strengthenyour lower back. If you’re an executive who sits at a desk forlong hours, your back muscles soon grow weak and cannot sup-port your spine and your skeletal frame as it was designed to do.
What I like about the back machine is how easy it works to
strengthen the back. As little as ﬁve minutes a day and three daysa week is all the exercise you need to start the program. Andsince the exercise time is so short and not very strenuous, youcan exercise anytime of the day or night.
There are ten tension positions. You start at the smallest setting
and gradually build up as you increase your strength. In a rela-tively short time, you’ll be able to feel the difference. I can’tguarantee that your lower back problems will be gone forever,but the Nautilus Lower Back machine can really make a differ-ence. And even with its low price, the Nautilus comes with a 30-day exercise trial period. If the unit doesn’t make a big differencein your exercise program, return the unit to JS&A for a full re-fund of your purchase price. But act quickly. Once we sell allthese units, that’s all we can get. One last thing. Please don’t callour operators to ﬁnd out the number of mispelled words.
The Nautilus Lower Back machine is made out of tubular steel
that will take a tremendous amount of abuse. All the contact sur-faces are cushioned and covered with black Naugahyde. It takesonly a few minutes to assemble it with a screwdriver and wrenchand it measures 34
1/2″×51″x 54″and weighs 150 pounds. The

I had two surprises with the results from this ad. The ﬁrst
was the number of people who missed many of the words. Wemade more proﬁt than I had anticipated. There were exactly 25misspelled words, but on average most people found around 20of them.
The second surprise was the number of people who called
me to tell me that they had spent hours reading and rereading thead to ﬁnd the number of misspelled words even though they hadno intention of buying the unit. 
I then used this technique to sell the Franklin Spelling
Computer. For the spelling computer, it certainly made sense asit tied into the product nicely. But it was this ﬁrst Nautilus ad thatreally launched the concept.
One of the strong points of this ad was the involvement that
it created on the part of the reader. I received mail months laterasking me for the correct number of misspelled words. Peoplewere spending hours reading my ad. How many ads can claimthat distinction?
The people who found most or all of the words really had a
bargain too. And we eventually sold all of our inventory in whatwas a very successful ad. Bad spelling, bad grammar, whocared? We broke a few rules and came up with a very uniquemarketing concept that could still work today.

the material I have presented. You know how to write great copyand build that slippery slide. You understand the psychologicaltriggers and how effectively they can be used to sell your prod-uct or service. And ﬁnally, you understand the role of a powerfulsatisfaction conviction.
Once you understand the principles of a print mail order ad,
you’re ready to apply those principles to enhance all your com-munication skills. Whether in a radio commercial or on a website, all the principles apply, with one caveat—some principlesare more important than others depending on the format or themedium. Let me explain.
Whereas in a mail order ad your copy is very important,
what techniques work best on TV? What psychological triggerswork best on radio or on the Internet? For example, on the Inter-net there is greater involvement on the part of the prospect. He orshe must take an action such as clicking on a button or on a link.So interactivity is an important concept.
The remainder of this handbook focuses on the various me-
dia and how they differ from a print ad, and consequently how towrite copy for each format.
I am also including a large amount of marketing informa-
tion to help guide you in the copywriting process. If you don’tknow the best way to market a particular product or service in aspeciﬁc medium, how can you write copy for it? So I go intodepth and explain the differences and the quirks to watch for asyou examine all the media possibilities and their potential.

Catalogs
Here’s a format where copy and graphics play a big role. The
catalog cover should present the best picture—the most dramaticshot in the entire catalog or a product that best represents whatcan be found inside.
I used to feature a product on the cover of my catalogs that
was unusual, novel and different and looked dramatic. It didn’tmatter if it wasn’t a big seller. The important point was that itcaused the prospect to pause and not just throw the catalog away.The cover is like the headline in a print ad. Its sole purpose is toget you into the catalog and to start reviewing the other productsor to put it aside for reading later. You want to avoid it beingsimply thrown in the trash.
A good catalog should have a message from the president in
the front of the catalog along with his or her picture. This is im-portant. A catalog is like a store. If the store lacked a proprietor,it would seem cold, too big or corporate.
That personal message at the front of the catalog is like a
Wal-Mart associate standing at the entrance of a Wal-Mart storegreeting visitors as they walk in. It makes the store more human,makes the proprietor a friendly face you can contact shouldthings not work out to your satisfaction. You feel safe in dealingwith the company because you know there is a human behind thecatalog and that human is real and reachable. Your copy shouldreﬂect this. It should read like a personal letter to your prospectsand should express your sincerity and commitment to satisfyingtheir needs. I would rank this letter as one of the most importantpieces of copy in the entire catalog.
Producing a catalog is a matter of arranging graphics and
copy in a pleasing and easy-to-follow format. Combining thegraphics and copy is similar to creating a print ad. You should
277Writing for Different Media Chapter 36
======================================== [Página 302] ========================================

have a short but enticing headline, a subheadline that explains a
little more about what you are offering and then copy that coverseach aspect of the product and its beneﬁts to your prospect.
It is extremely important to include all the salient features
of the product you are selling. Leave out one small fact—evenone that may seem insigniﬁcant such as a product’s weight—and you’ll reduce your sales. A catalog description should con-tain all the information you need for your prospect to make abuying decision. Leave out one small fact, and you run the riskof reducing your response. The missing fact gives the buyer anexcuse to delay his or her decision. And it raises a question as towhether the product will ﬁt his or her needs. Nobody wants tobuy something and then have to return it. So being thorough inyour description will make a big difference in the minds of yourprospects. They will feel conﬁdent that what they buy they willlike and keep—always knowing, of course, that they can returnthe item for any reason.
The next thing to consider is the environment you create
through the graphics and the look of the catalog. If you are send-ing your catalog to sophisticated buyers, make sure that the copyand the look of the catalog are upscale. If you are selling prod-ucts in a closeout catalog, you don’t want your catalog to looktoo slick. Your customer doesn’t expect to see an expensive cata-log selling products at really cheap prices. As a guide, set the en-vironment based on the price points you are selling yourproducts for.
In a mail order ad you should feature a single product or
service, leaving variations of that product out of the sales mes-sage. But in a catalog you have the opportunity of offering sev-eral variations of the main product you might sell in a mail orderprint ad. In fact, that’s what your customers expect.
A good example of this was given earlier in this handbook
(“Simplicity” in Chapter 19). I offered a single style of the SwissArmy watch and tested it against several styles. The single styleoffer worked best in the mail order ad, whereas the other watchstyles worked best in our catalog.
Finally, what works exceptionally well for product catalogs
is the personal sales message—something that I have used for
278UTILIZING YOUR COPYWRITING SKILLS
======================================== [Página 303] ========================================

years with great success. Let each product description sound like
a personal conversation with the prospect.
Say “I” or “me” or “my,” and talk as if you were a friendly
person chatting with your prospect. Your conversation mightsound something like, “I was walking down the street when Ihad this neat idea for my catalog.” Such rhetoric combines story-telling and the personal approach to advertisng, which I stronglyrecommend.
In the case of a catalog, think of it as a store, sell in it like
you would in a store and show your enthusiasm for the productsyou sell through your copy and your use of the ﬁrst person.
If something is important, give it more space. Make sure
you have your toll-free phone number on each page. Often aprospect will tear out a page and throw away the rest of the cata-log only to discover later that the toll-free number is missing.And even if your prospect keeps the entire catalog, having yourphone number on each page will make ordering easier.
Use an easy-to-remember toll-free phone number. Use
words to make up the number. When I call FedEx for a pickup,all I have to remember is 1-800-GOFEDEX. And if you do usewords to convey a phone number, also include the actual num-bers to make it easier for the prospect to dial.
The toll-free number should be large and rather obvious on
the order form. Most people will order over the phone or go to aweb site to order. So why not make the order form show thattoll-free number and web site address loud and clear?
Then make sure that your order form is easy to ﬁll out and
provides plenty of room to list all the necessary information. Ifmost people respond on the phone with the toll-free number oron your web site, though, why even have a catalog order form?The answer is that many catalog buyers ﬁrst list their purchaseson the order form before they actually call and order. It makesthe ordering process go faster and is a convenient record for thecustomer.
Finally, make sure that each operator who takes an order on
the phone has a script to sell something else after the customerplaces an order. This will certainly add incremental business andincrease catalog proﬁts.

Flyers: Insert Stuffers, Bounce Backs, and Broadsides
The common thread that all of these formats have is that they are
after-the-sale advertisements. Once you’ve made the sale, youshould place something in the package you are shipping that of-fers something your new customer might also be interested in.
The piece might contain offers on some of the other prod-
ucts you sell. It might even be a catalog designed speciﬁcally fornew customers. Or even the catalog from which the order wasoriginally made. It usually doesn’t cost any more postage to shipthese solicitations. And since it is being sent to a customer, thereis a better chance that it will be read and acted upon than if it wassimply sent to a prospect.
Insert stuffers and bounce backs are ﬂyers that are placed in
packages going to customers. A broadside is the ﬂyer folded toﬁt in a standard-sized #10 business envelope.
In the case of these solicitations, the piece you design
should use a similar format to your catalog page to provide alevel of continuity. Use an attention-getting headline, use bulletpoints where appropriate and don’t forget to provide that all-important ordering information—a coupon with your address,toll-free phone number, and web site address.
Direct Mail
One of the more effective ways to sell in print is through direct
mail. It’s a way to target a speciﬁc prospect who has exhibitedcertain buying tendencies, and it’s a way to target all of thosetendencies in a very efﬁcient way. But there are some importantnotes about copywriting that need to be observed in this form ofcommunication.
As I have mentioned throughout this handbook, the per-
sonal approach to selling can’t be beat. Selling is really a per-sonal relationship between the seller and the buyer. It’s arelationship of trust. And to enhance that trust there is nothinglike having your prospects know clearly whom they are dealingwith. Your prospects will pick up the vibrations of what youwrite, especially if you are making your communications soundvery personal.
Direct mail copy is among the most personal types of copy
280UTILIZING YOUR COPYWRITING SKILLS
======================================== [Página 305] ========================================

you can write. It is a letter written directly to another individual.
It is a message to a person whom you have sought out by simplyreﬁning your mailing criteria to focus on just those attributes thatrepresent your prospect. By selecting a mailing list that encom-passes those attributes, your chances of success will be greatlyenhanced.
The most important thing to be aware of is to keep the mes-
sage personal. Using the ﬁrst person is important. Use the word I
and avoid the term wewhen referring to your associates. In fact, it
is a lot better when referring to your company to talk about the staffas a team—for example, “My team of great engineers is availableto help you.” Compare that to: “We at Acme Motors have the skilland knowledge to provide assistance to you.” And your letter be-comes even more personal when it is signed by the sender.
In a direct mail piece, the letter is the most important part of
the entire mailing package. In it you must include the sales pitch,the slippery slide—designed to get the recipient of your mailingpiece to read the entire letter—and all the psychological triggersdescribed earlier. You have the space and the time to make a verygood sales presentation.
The length of the letter can vary. If you can get your mes-
sage onto one page, you make the mailing less intimidating.More pages are okay, too, if you’ve written a strong enough ﬁrstpage to keep them reading and of course if the subject is interest-ing to the reader; then you’re doing your job as a copywriter.Write 10 pages if you feel it is important to do so in order to sellyour product or service, but the letter has got to be so compellingthat the reader continues to read straight through to the end ofthe letter as if on a slippery slide.
Use any collateral material that is included with the letter to
visually describe your product or service. The more importantmessage, however, is in the letter. A brochure won’t sell yourproduct as effectively as a good letter. The brochure or the colorﬂyer could be critical to the sale but not nearly as important asthe letter.
And you can certainly refer to the brochure in your letter,
but don’t rely on that fancy brochure to do the complete sellingjob. It won’t, no matter how pretty and how good it may look.
281WRITING FOR DIFFERENT MEDIA
======================================== [Página 306] ========================================

Don’t forget that postscript (PS). The PS in a letter is often
the most-read line of type on the page. So either offer somethingin the PS that causes the reader to solidify a buying decision orreiterate a very important point.
Use objects with the letter. When I did advertising for my
ski-lift account I had a small number of prospects—around 500.It was therefore practical for me to include something unusual ineach mailing. I sent a large button that said “No Jerk” to empha-size the smooth nature of my ski lift. I sent a brochure that ex-panded so that one side read “expand” and sent it with a niceletter. My prospects looked forward to each mailing simply toﬁnd out what I was going to say and include in my next mailing.
In direct mail, the mailing list is also a critical element to
the success of a direct mail piece. Your own satisﬁed customersfor a similar product will be your best and hottest list if they’vepurchased recently—the more recently the better. If you pur-chase lists, make sure the prospects on a list are demographicallysimilar to your customers and that they have bought fairly re-cently through the mail and for purchases within the price rangeof what you are offering.
But let’s say you have a great letter, a cute little gimmick
you are mailing with your letter and a ﬁrst-rate mailing list.What is missing? How about a great message on your envelope?Your envelope is like the headline on a mail order ad. It will at-tract those prospects interested enough to read the subheadline,which usually is inside the envelope so you often need to getthem to open the envelope in order to read the subheadline. Ofcourse you can put the subheadline on the envelope, too. Youmight even try using some attention-getting statement if you feelthe statement will cause the customer to open the envelope. If re-cipients are interested in your offer, they will know right awaywhether to open the envelope or throw it into the trash.
Just as people are inclined to discard Internet spam if they
don’t recognize the sender without even opening the e-mail, re-cipients of your mailings are inclined to throw out your mailingpiece without even opening it. But there are ways to get them toopen the envelope.
If you put no name or headline on the envelope (just the re-
282UTILIZING YOUR COPYWRITING SKILLS
======================================== [Página 307] ========================================

turn address), most of the recipients will open it out of curiosity.
After all, it might be a credit card (many credit cards are sent thisway). If the envelope has your company name and address andthe person receiving it recognizes it as a company he or she hasbought from before, chances are they will open it.
A computer-addressed envelope that looks like it was in-
dividually typed provides a strong incentive to open the enve-lope as well.
A good tip is for you to study the mail that comes into your
mailbox. Which ones do you open and which ones do youquickly throw out? Often you are representative of the peoplewho are your prospects.
What works can be easily determined if you test every
mailing piece you send out against a different version of thesame mailing piece. Testing is the critical factor that makes a bigdifference in the success of anything you do in direct marketing.And as a copywriter you can learn so much by observing whatworks and what doesn’t.
Newspapers
Newspapers are one topic I can speak about from a great deal of
experience. Not only have I advertised in many daily and weeklynewspapers, but I actually published a weekly newspaper, theMaui Weekly , for six years in Maui, Hawaii, before I sold it to
the island’s daily newspaper in 2005.
If the ad you are placing in a newspaper is a mail order ad,
it should pay for itself and cover the cost of the insertion the ﬁrsttime it appears.
If you are advertising something that promotes a retail es-
tablishment, then frequency is a major key. Putting an ad in apaper only once is simply a waste of time and money. Oftenpeople don’t respond right away. There is a lag time betweenseeing your ad the ﬁrst time and then seeing it so often that alevel of trust develops. Or it could be simply the time isn’t quiteright when the ad ﬁrst appears because of other events in thecommunity.
Let’s say you are advertising a restaurant. The ad is to ap-
pear each week in the dining section of the weekly newspaper
283WRITING FOR DIFFERENT MEDIA
======================================== [Página 308] ========================================

for a total of 13 weeks. The ad appears the ﬁrst week and there
seems to be little response. The ad appears the second week anda few more people show up. Slowly but surely the restaurant’scustomers appear in greater numbers.
I can remember when I was in college at the University of
Miami and a restaurant owner who saw that I was a studentasked if I knew how to encourage other students to come to hisOld Hickory Barbeque restaurant. I told him that I felt I couldreach the students. I knew what the students responded to andfelt that an ad in the daily college paper, the Hurricane , would
do the trick. But as an aspiring copywriter, I also knew that thecopy for this chicken and rib joint on the outskirts of town had tobe so compelling and different that students would respond to itand not think of it as just advertising.
So the ad I ran talked about a chicken and rib special and
then I told students that there was a catch. To get this specialprice, they had to bring in the top of a Brinks armored car. Thead ran. I held my breath and at ﬁrst was too embarrassed to goto the restaurant and see the owner, concerned that maybe Ihad been a little over-the-top in what I had written. But to mysurprise when I ﬁnally pulled up to the restaurant, there was aline around the block—with students carrying pieces of ply-wood, sheets of tin, garbage can covers marked “Brinks Ar-mored Car Top” and a variety of other similar objects. The adwas a huge success.
I was communicating with the students in a way that they
appreciated. And they responded in large numbers. It was alsoone of the few times when an ad for a retail establishmentworked without the beneﬁt of frequency.
Mail order ads in newspapers are designed to hit the mass
market. Assuming you are advertising in a daily newspaper cov-ering a large metropolitan area, then you’ve got to think in termsof lower-priced items that the mass market may relate to in largeenough numbers. If, however, you have higher-ticket items, theWall Street Journal would be your better venue for advertising.
In the case of the Wall Street Journal , you go to a higher demo-
graphic to ﬁnd the target audience you’ll need to sell your prod-uct or service.
284UTILIZING YOUR COPYWRITING SKILLS
======================================== [Página 309] ========================================

At its peak, my mail order company, JS&A, used the Wall
Street Journal extensively to sell my high-priced gadgets. In
fact, at one point we were among the Journal ’s largest advertis-
ers. I liked the Journal because I was able to get my ads into the
paper quickly—usually within a few days—and get my responsea few days later. With the fast pace at which our products wereintroduced, peaked and then became obsolete, this speed was es-sential in introducing new products quickly and keeping up withthe rapid price deterioration that was taking place in the con-sumer electronics industry.
You could make a nice proﬁt in a daily newspaper if you
bought your space right. And there are brokers who handle thistype of advertising and are able to provide the newspaper spaceat very low prices so that indeed a nice proﬁt can be made.
The same principles that apply to a mail order ad de-
scribed in the ﬁrst part of the book apply here, of course. Andyour goal is to make a proﬁt from your mail order ad the ﬁrsttime you run it.
If the cost of space is a concern and you can get your mes-
sage across in a smaller ad without much copy, then a small admight be a good way to conserve your cash. An ad with a low-priced offer where the low price is the big attraction works wellin this kind of situation. But keep in mind that you are compet-ing with other small ads instead of dominating the page as youwould with a larger, more descriptive ad.
Daily newspapers in the United States are losing circula-
tion. Weekly community newspapers are gaining in circulation.Why? Because the public can get their national and internationalnews from TV or on the Internet 24/7. Community newspaperssuch as the Maui Weekly cover issues of interest to the local
community—news that can’t be found on TV or on the Internet.
One of the things I did when I ﬁrst bought the Maui Weekly in
1999 was to change the format of the paper and keep this sameformat week after week. Each issue was interesting and consistent.I also used many of the principles that I’ve explained in the ﬁrstthree sections of this book to enhance my rapport with the com-munity. I found that consistency was my most important principle.It took awhile but before long the community embraced the publi-
285WRITING FOR DIFFERENT MEDIA
======================================== [Página 310] ========================================

cation and looked forward to receiving it each week. And our cir-
culation and advertising grew as a result. The one powerful triggerof consistency also worked for our advertisers. Keeping a regularschedule and the same format while changing the copy proved tobe successful for our advertisers as well.
The big advantage of a newspaper is the fast response
time—your ability to get your ad into a paper quickly and thespeed of the response you receive after your ad appears. Thelife of each issue of a daily newspaper is usually just a fewdays, so your prospect will generally respond quickly duringthat time frame. For a weekly, the life of an issue is typicallyaround 10 days.
Frequency is also an important consideration if you are
running retail advertising for such establishments as restau-rants, car dealerships, furniture stores, clothing outlets and realestate sales.
Another nice feature of running ads in newspapers is the
sheer volume of newspapers available to advertise in. If your adworks, it can be run nationally and reach millions of people in arelatively short period of time.
If you have a product or service that would appeal to the
general public and it is priced low enough while representinggood value, newspapers are a good choice. For a higher-pricedproduct, reﬁne your choice of newspapers to the more upscalepapers such as the Wall Street Journal or many of the other busi-
ness publications.
Billboards
A billboard uses few words to convey its message, so those
words must be very powerful or create immediate awareness orthe billboard is useless. From your research you must write a sin-gle headline and, at the most, a minimal subheadline, accompa-nied by a graphic that conveys the big idea you’re trying toconvey.
Here is where simplicity is the controlling factor. Your mes-
sage has to be so simple and direct that occupants of cars passingby at 75 miles an hour can pick out the message and quicklygrasp its meaning.
286UTILIZING YOUR COPYWRITING SKILLS
======================================== [Página 311] ========================================

A billboard can create curiosity and a buzz such as in the
Folgers coffee teaser campaign of the late 1960s that stated, “Amountain is moving to Chicago,” when Folgers introduced itscoffee to the Chicago area. The mountain was actually thegraphic on the container of coffee, but nobody knew exactlywhat the billboards meant until the formal announcement.
The point you always want to remember when you write
copy for a billboard is that you need to capture the imaginationof your prospect in a very short, simple and effective way in amatter of a few seconds.
Billboards have been used effectively to create a buzz, as in
the Folgers example, or to establish brand recognition, and areideal for a recognized brand as well as to build brand awareness.They can be used to promote an establishment up the road or tosell beer. But whatever the task, the key is brevity and simplicity.
Press Releases
Press releases are a means of disseminating information to vari-
ous media where the information is published at no charge. It’sfree and sometimes can provide great value.
But wait. There is a risk—the chance that the person pub-
lishing what you send may distort the message in a rewrite. It’s atwo-edged sword. In general, though, this free publicity is a pos-itive thing and can be used very effectively either as the sole wayto market a product or part of a campaign.
First, let’s make sure that we put the proper heading at the
very top of the paper so the person receiving the message knowsthat it’s for public relations (PR). My suggestion is to put “NewsRelease” at the top—“Press Release” has gotten old hat.
I would then put the date and the words “For Immediate
Release” in the top right-hand corner of the release. Giving alater release date is also acceptable but very rare.
Next, I would come up with a headline and subheadline
that would appeal to the readers of the publication receivingthe release.
Then put the city of origin for the news release, similar to
the way news stories appear in a newspaper: something like“(Chicago, IL) A major new breakthrough . . .”
287WRITING FOR DIFFERENT MEDIA
======================================== [Página 312] ========================================

The news release should be written like a news story, com-
plete with as much detail at the beginning as possible. Within afew paragraphs all the salient points should be encapsulated soan editor or any reader can get the gist of what you’re sayingvery quickly. Use the typical who, what, when, where, why andhow at the very beginning of your release.
Remember you are appealing to the editor to view what you
are sending as news and not a puff piece promoting your com-pany or its product. The editor wants to make sure that the pieceis relevant to the publication’s audience.
You can use quotes in the release that can be attributed to
experts who will say things about your product or service thatyou can’t say in the body of your release. “John Jackson, chair-man of the company making the Bone Fone, says, ‘Never be-fore in the history of sound has a product this novel beenintroduced.’ ” A quote like this has to be attributed to someone,so use the device as an opportunity to include testimonials, state-ments from the president of the company or other comments thatenhance the news in your article.
Psychological triggers that play an important role in a
news release are “linking” and “current fads.” If there is a fadsweeping the country, see if you can cleanly link into it withyour product or service. For example, in the 1960s at the heightof the women’s liberation movement, my ski resort accountasked if I could help promote its snowmobile rental businessthrough PR. It seems that nobody realized that snowmobilescould be rented at this ski resort.
The hottest fad or trend at the time was the women’s libera-
tion movement, and tying it into my client’s wishes, I came upwith a headline, “Ski Resort Bans Woman Snowmobile Dri-vers.” The subheadline then explained the ban in more detail:“Schuss Mountain Ski Resort in northern Michigan claimswomen snowmobile drivers are causing too many accidents soowner bans all women from using them.”
The release that followed was brief. It didn’t have to be too
long. I quoted Dan Iannotti, the owner of the resort, as saying,“There’s nothing worse than a woman behind the wheel of asnowmobile.”
288UTILIZING YOUR COPYWRITING SKILLS
======================================== [Página 313] ========================================

Iannotti had an open mind and thought the idea was clever
enough to possibly make a big splash, so he approved it. All hellbroke loose after it was released to the local media. The releasemade the national network news shows and the front page ofmany newspapers and became one of the most discussed topicson the talk shows. I had indeed linked into a strong trend thathelped my client get out his message.
The snowmobile rentals jumped at the resort—of course
not before we issued another release a week later with the head-line “Ban Lifted at Ski Resort” and subheadline “Because of thepressure, Schuss Mountain ski resort lifts ban on women snow-mobilers”—and all this was followed by text that explained thechange of heart by the owner after a number of women com-plained about the ban. “We have set up a school to teach goodsnowmobile habits,” said Iannotti in the text of the release.
A friend of mine had a product that he sold using only PR.
It was a device that he put over his toilet and onto which a catclimbed to use the toilet. I’m not kidding. And the productworked. But he couldn’t advertise it in any magazine as they allwere repulsed by the thought of advertising this type of product.He then resorted to PR and was able to get national publicitymore easily than he could from trying to advertise it.
This is not meant to be a resource on PR principles but
rather some of the principles that could apply to a news releasesent to a publication or TV network. Realize that as a copy-writer, your role here is to look at your copy as news editorswould and write it to ﬁt their model of what a good news storyshould reﬂect.
Radio
Radio draws on the imaginations of your listeners to get a strong,
personal message across. And radio is negotiable and often notvery expensive, making it a good part of an advertiser’s mix.
To make radio work, you need frequency. You can have a
great radio spot but unless it is repeated often enough, it won’tbe as effective.
As with TV , you can buy many different forms of radio. A
radio spot is typically from 10 seconds to 60 seconds in duration,
289WRITING FOR DIFFERENT MEDIA
======================================== [Página 314] ========================================

and there is also the long-form radio commercial referred to as
“brokered time.” This is where the advertiser buys the time slot(usually a half hour to an hour) and uses it just like a talk show topromote his or her own business. It might be a real estate show,an investment program or even a show on health.
Los Angeles advertising guru and radio copywriter Dan
O’Day says that it is vital to have only one message to convey tothe listener in the typical radio spot, and that should be what hecalls the “core message.”
“Radio is the most personal of all mass media. You listen to
the message in a linear fashion one statement after the next,”says O’Day.
O’Day points out that radio is also a very visual medium in
the sense that the listener has to imagine what is being described.For example, if a child is described as beautiful, the listener pic-tures a child he or she considers to be beautiful. If this was doneon TV and a child was shown, there might be a credibility gap.The child visualized by the radio listener may be personallymore beautiful to him or her than the actual one seen on TV .
If you are doing a direct response radio spot, one of the
most important elements is the toll-free number. Is it easy to re-member? Most radio listeners are driving their cars, and othersjust may not have a pen and paper handy. Some advertisers areusing words instead of numbers to make it easy to remember.For example, 1-800-FLOWERS or 1-800-CARPETS or even1-800-BLUBLOCKER. These make great radio phone numbers.
In the case of the BluBlocker number, there are a few extra
letters in BluBlocker (9 instead of the correct 7) but that’s okayas it doesn’t matter to the phone company if you punch a fewmore keys after you dial the number, and besides, it’s easy to re-member. But you’ve got to be careful that people spell the pho-netic version of your number correctly. For example, manypeople have typed in 1-800-BLUEBLOCKER by mistake,spelling “blue” correctly even though it is not the actual spellingof the brand. So we arranged for both the correct and the incor-rect numbers to be directed to the same phone line. We assumedin advance that sometimes it was going to be misspelled andtherefore prepared for it.
290UTILIZING YOUR COPYWRITING SKILLS
======================================== [Página 315] ========================================

The second thing to remember with a direct response spot is
that the start of the spot is critical for people to stay tuned andpay attention. So you might start out with a curiosity trigger suchas, “I’ve got some important news for those of you who are con-cerned about the bird ﬂu.” Radio is a music and news medium.The more you therefore make your message sound like news, themore compatible your message is with the medium.
Dick Orkin was known in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s for
his humorous spots. They told a story. And the humor was notfor the sake of being funny—more for the fact that it grabbedyou and lent a human tone to the message. In the 1960s and early1970s radio personality Stan Freberg produced some funnyspots, too. But the spots from both Orkin and Freberg had thatsingle core message that came across loud and clear.
Take the commercial from Motel 6. “We’ll leave the light
on for ya” was the tagline at the end of those spots. But the coremessage, according to O’Day, “was not that well-recalled sloganbut that Motel 6 had the lowest room rates—actually the lowestroom rates of any national chain.” And it also had a very per-sonal message recited by Tom Bodett. Radio became Motel 6’sprimary advertising medium.
I’ve used radio very effectively during my entire advertis-
ing career. More recently, I have used radio to promote myBluBlocker sunglasses brand. Since BluBlocker is already an es-tablished sunglasses brand, I used radio to draw attention towhere you could buy BluBlockers. It’s a product worn in goodweather, so I sponsored the weather and trafﬁc reports. The an-nouncer would always have a captive audience wanting to hearthis information so I had the perfect environment for my mes-sage. The announcer would start out, “The trafﬁc and weatherare brought to you by BluBlocker high-resolution sunglasses.Get BluBlockers at your local Walgreens Drug Store.” In just afew seconds I was able to get across my core message, “Get yourBluBlockers at Walgreens.” And those spots worked very wellfor us through daily repetition.
As a copywriter, realize that radio is among the most per-
sonal of all media with a core message—simple, clean and easyto comprehend.

Television
Writing copy for TV follows many of the same principles
you’ve learned in this book, but the copy will vary by length ofthe commercial. Now that might seem obvious but let me ex-plain further.
I have had personal experience and both success and failure
in all of the various TV formats we will discuss. I have sold mil-lions of pairs of sunglasses and other products on infomercials,home shopping channels and TV spots. I have tested all elementsof a TV commercial and know what works and what doesn’t.What you read here should act as an excellent guideline on howto write copy for TV because it is presented by somebody withextensive personal experience in all of the various TV formats.
Some of the facts mentioned will have more to do with
marketing than copywriting. But as a copywriter you would bewasting your time writing copy for a TV spot that won’t workbecause it is violating some important marketing principle. So ina sense, knowing a little about marketing in this very powerfulcategory is very important to the copywriter.
Let’s start with the TV spot commercial or what is called
short-form TV , which can be anywhere from 30 seconds totwo minutes long, and go over six of the copywriting and mar-keting points you’ll need to know to successfully write copyfor this format.
1.Typically the most effective way to determine if your product
is suitable for this form of advertising is price point. If yourproduct is an impulse item (deﬁned as being in the $29.95 orless retail price category), then chances are this might be anappropriate format to sell your product.
2.The next criterion should be value. It must appear almost too
good to be true. Greed will play a role here. Your customersmust feel that they are getting a bigger value than they be-lieve possible. They must subconsciously think, “How canthey do it?”
3.Simplicity is extremely important, too. Keeping the offer
simple and uncomplicated is critical. Anything that compli-cates the commercial will lose sales. The only exception to
292UTILIZING YOUR COPYWRITING SKILLS
======================================== [Página 317] ========================================

this rule is near the end of the spot when you start adding on
additional items to increase the value. For example, “If youcall within the next 20 minutes, I’ll also include an extramixer free of charge. That’s two mixers for $19.95.” Don’tgive the prospect a choice to make. There should be only onechoice—“Buy this product now and get all of this.” Don’t of-fer different colors or sizes. It’s one offer and no choices.Only when your prospects call on the phone do you “upsell”them to other items or offer various versions or multiples ofthe same offer.
4.Use a sense of urgency. You need to make sure that the
prospect doesn’t copy the phone number down with the ideaof purchasing your product later on, because chances are heor she won’t. Like the preceding, using greed as a motivatorand a time limit to respond works wonders.
5.Include a web site address. Many viewers will copy both the
toll-free number and the web site address and then go to theircomputers. People are different. Some like to buy on thephone, others through the mail and still others on the Internet.You want to appeal to all of them. Some prospects may getturned off when they call to order a product and reach some-body in another country who speaks with an unintelligibleaccent. They may decide to hang up and buy the item on theInternet. It has happened to me. And with so much of our ser-vice industry being exported to other countries, the Webmight be a logical place to buy.
6.Your product must appeal to a mass market: all women, all
men, both men and women over the age of 40 or large seg-ments of the general public. After all, TV reaches a massmarket and unless your product appeals to the masses you arewasting a lot of money reaching your target market. For ex-ample, I have run spots for my BluBlocker sunglasses andhave done quite well. Why? They appeal to a mass audienceof both men and women and almost all age groups. Sun-glasses are a mass market product.
If your product ﬁts the preceding criteria, then you’ve got a
good chance at succeeding in this medium. Your approach now
293WRITING FOR DIFFERENT MEDIA
======================================== [Página 318] ========================================

is to determine how to write a spot that is compelling, stops the
viewer and makes an offer that provides a real beneﬁt to theconsumer.
Once again, the same principles of copywriting apply to a
TV spot. But in a spot you have to literally count your words,making them reach the point quickly while presenting yourproduct and its beneﬁts in the proper environment.
You create the environment by the visuals. If you’re selling
a kitchen appliance, use a kitchen as your background. If you’reselling an automobile dent remover, show a homeowner at homeremoving the dents from his or her moderately priced car. Re-member that you are reaching the masses and use props thatidentify and are typical for that market.
Focus on the core message you want to convey. Every word
and every visual element have to lead the viewer to the ﬁnal buy-ing conclusion. If you offer bonuses, make sure the bonus youoffer is something the same audience would want. You don’twant to give a free gift of something that a portion of the audi-ence may not care for. What this does is deter them from buyingthe product they intended on buying because they feel they arepaying for something they don’t want.
I recently saw a TV spot offering a very small table to be
used whenever you needed to work or eat while watching TV .The free bonus gift was a cloth TV remote holder that you woulddrape over the side of your chair. Even though logically the clothremote holder made sense because the table would be used pri-marily for TV , this was a bad idea. First, your chair may not havea side to it. Secondly, many viewers may not care for the free giftanyway and would reject the main offer because in their mindsthey would be paying more for something they didn’t want.
The key in all these offers is to test the free gift versus no
gift and maybe against another gift. It is during the testingprocess that you ﬁnd out what really works, and it is often notwhat you expected.
The Infomercial
The infomercial (half-hour commercial), commonly referred to
in the advertising trade as long-form TV , became an advertising
294UTILIZING YOUR COPYWRITING SKILLS
======================================== [Página 319] ========================================

phenomenon in the mid-1980s when the Federal Communica-
tions Commission (FCC) deregulated many of its policies andallowed for the broadcast of 30 minutes of straight advertising.
At ﬁrst, real estate shows appeared on the air. Then the
BluBlocker sunglasses made their ﬁrst showing in 1986, andshortly thereafter came the exercise, self-help and get-rich-quickshows. Infomercials became extremely popular in a very shortperiod of time. Overnight companies launched what soon be-came household names. Some marketers became instant million-aires, making small fortunes in just a few months, while otherslost millions and went bankrupt just as quickly.
The key to this medium is to determine a good format in
which to present your show. It should resemble what is popularand what is currently being broadcast. For example, if realityshows are popular, then maybe your product would lend itself toa reality show. If interview shows like Larry King Live are popu-
lar, then set up an interview format. If your product would ap-peal to the Oprah Winfrey Show audience, then set use a set that
looks similar to Oprah’s. In short, you identify with a popularformat that ﬁts your product and with which your prospectiveaudience is comfortable and that they can harmonize with.
A good example of this approach is our BluBlocker in-
fomercial, which ran in four different versions for six years andcreated a brand name for sunglasses from all the exposure, not tomention a lot of sales. I used a candid-camera approach famousduring the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. I would walk up to strangersand interview them right on the street or on the beach, and thenhave them try on my sunglasses and react with surprised expres-sions of wonder or amazement.
For a product to work on long-form TV , the keys for suc-
cess are a good product in the $39 to $250 price range with sufﬁ-cient margin or one that has good continuity and back-end salespotential—in short, a product that you can automatically ship toyour customers every month like vitamins or one that has strongsales after the initial sale. With a half hour you have more time tosell and therefore can justify a purchase to the viewer muchmore easily than you can in a TV spot.
Today, the infomercial industry has shaken out the ﬂy-by-
295WRITING FOR DIFFERENT MEDIA
======================================== [Página 320] ========================================

nights, and only the more experienced and stable companies re-
main. It is also a lot more difﬁcult to succeed in this ﬁeld unlessyou really know what you are doing. And that includes knowingthe importance of a product with continuity and back-end sales.
Back-End Sales
When you produce a successful TV spot or infomercial and your
customer calls to order your product, there is a major sales op-portunity available to you while your customer is on the phone.The sale in this case is called back-end sales, or what is com-monly called in the industry “upsells.” Often, you can take asimple $49.95 sale and turn it into a $200 sale if you come upwith some good products to enhance the initial purchase or evena service that your prospect may want after the sale such ascoaching in the case of some income opportunity shows.
For example, when I called to order the knife set Ron
Popeil offered in an infomercial in early 2006, the operator hada script she used to try to sell me more related products. This isone more opportunity for a copywriter to come up with salescopy to increase the sales of the product that was originally of-fered. It may be copy that says, “Because you are orderingwithin 20 minutes of the show, you are entitled to buy our spe-cial deluxe knife set holder. This handsome wooden holdercomes with engraved names for each of the knives you haveordered .... ”
You can offer anything from a deluxe version of a product
or a second one at a discount to a complete set of something thatmay relate to your product or even the opportunity to get theproduct for less if the buyer signs up for automatic shipments(what is called “continuity”).
As a copywriter, you may be asked to write copy for the up-
sell. After all, it is a form of selling and you should be preparedto write copy for this selling opportunity. My suggestion is tocall up and order some of the products on TV and see how theoperators handle their upsells. Often the upsell will vary greatlydepending on the current approach to upsells. For example, to-day many upsells try to encourage continuity sales (regularmonthly shipments), and other times it might be coaching or a
296UTILIZING YOUR COPYWRITING SKILLS
======================================== [Página 321] ========================================

deluxe version of something. Keeping your ﬁngers on the pulse
of the market is an excellent way for you to become an expert onthis important selling opportunity. Once you are knowledgableabout the product, the prospect and even the currently offeredupsells by others, you’ll be able to apply the same principlesyou’ve already learned to come up with a variety of different ap-proaches, all of which will require testing to determine whichone will work best.
After-Sale Opportunities
If you thought that the upsell was the last opportunity to make
that sale, think again. You now have a huge mailing list of thosewho have bought your product from your ads on TV , some withaverage orders and others spending into the hundreds of dollars.
How do you address these people to sell them more? What
tricks of the copywriting trade do you use to entice them to keepbuying from you?
Here’s a clue. If you have a list that was gathered from cus-
tomers who bought on TV , use telemarketing. If they bought outof a catalog or from a print ad, use print or direct mail.
You may be wasting your time and money trying to reach
somebody using a catalog or a direct mail solicitation when thetelephone is the way to reach them. And a good copywriter willcreate a good telephone selling message to reach this potentiallylucrative audience.
Again, using the principles already expressed in this hand-
book is a start. Begin the conversation with the purpose of estab-lishing dialogue: “Mrs. Jones, how are you today?” “Fine,” shesays. Then you respond with the reason you are calling and theoffer you are making with the hope of having each question youask elicit a yes or positive answer. For example, “I understandyou have purchased Ron Popeil’s knife set—is that correct?”
Your customer once again responds with a positive re-
sponse. “Yes, I did” might be the answer. You have now estab-lished rapport and have gotten the start of the “yes” answers youneed to create the harmony required to lead you to a positive an-swer when you ask for the sale.
“Well, Mrs. Jones, Ron Popeil has asked me to call you
297WRITING FOR DIFFERENT MEDIA
======================================== [Página 322] ========================================

with a special offer—something that would go nicely with your
knife set.” Here you are using a little bit of curiosity. What is thething Ron Popeil is offering? “Do you have a minute to talk?”Here you are getting another yes. Then you go into the salespitch and ask, “How many sets would you like?”
Home Shopping
I’ve had a lot of experience selling on QVC—the home shop-
ping network both in Europe and in the United States. There isnot much a copywriter needs to do there except for creating awritten sales pitch the show hosts use to brief themselves. Again,it is the job of the copywriter to describe the product, brieﬂymentioning all its beneﬁts and features. You can recommend var-ious upsells and create the copy for the operators, but very oftenthe upsell is up to QVC both to script and to use as they see ﬁt.
The home shopping networks in the United States and
throughout the world are usually live broadcasts without theneed for scripts, but they are worth mentioning if only to showthat a copywriter’s job can cover all of the aspects of TV regard-less of the form it may take.
QVC does over $6 billion in sales a year. Their programs
reach millions of households and have successfully delivered toconsumers quality, value and convenience. And they love prod-ucts that have proven themselves both in print and on TV . So ifyou are successful with a product in the other formats mentionedhere, QVC would make a great opportunity for you once you’veproven that you have a winning product.
Once during a “Today’s Special Value” feature on QVC
over 250,000 pairs of BluBlockers were sold. Now, that is in-credible power—and all in one day.
The Internet
The Internet holds such incredible advantages for copywriters
and marketers that it indeed has become a major revolution insales and marketing. And it will continue to grow now and wellinto the future. There are four reasons for this.
First, you can be a tiny company with little means but look
like even the biggest companies on the Internet. In short, yourenvironment is your graphic presentation. The Internet levels the
298UTILIZING YOUR COPYWRITING SKILLS
======================================== [Página 323] ========================================

playing ﬁeld, and graphics determine your image. Your race, re-
ligion and age do not matter. Cameron Johnson made millions ofdollars on the Internet before he reached voting age. At 15 heearned $50,000 selling Beanie Babies and went on to earn$15,000 a day on one of his many sites. Now, at 21, he’s one ofthe most successful Internet marketers in history—and note, hestarted as a teenager.
Second, testing is now less expensive and more immediate.
You can easily test a marketing concept and your copy—eventest the results of changing just a few words—to determine thedifference in response, and all at almost no cost. This is a majorbreakthrough in the art and science of testing.
Third, the speed at which you can come up with an idea and
implement it quickly at low cost dwarfs almost every other formof selling and marketing. This is a wonderful time to be living ifyou love copywriting and marketing.
Finally, there are many ways to sell using the Internet: e-
mail broadcasts, using other media to call attention to yourweb site, links from other web sites, afﬁliate programs and thelist goes on.
And with the emergence of Internet video, a new dimension
has been added—all the features of television combined with allthe advantages of the Internet—resulting in a powerful medium,one that is still expanding and unfolding. As bandwidth andvideo grow on the Web, so do the possibilities for an extremelyeffective way to grow a business.
How does a copywriter tackle a copywriting assignment to
write copy for the Internet? How do we write for the Internet?How do you capture a prospect on this unique and exciting for-mat? It’s more involved than you may think, but once you under-stand some of the thinking and the marketing principles behindthe format you can truly build an empire.
First you’ve got to get people to read your copy. They either
have to hear about your web site from some publicity you’vegenerated, advertising you’ve done, links from other web sites ore-mail broadcasts you make. The problem is that people refer tounsolicited e-mails as spam and therefore unwanted.
What will often work is a combination of elements to allow
299WRITING FOR DIFFERENT MEDIA
======================================== [Página 324] ========================================

you to build your opt-in names and consequently send them
communications they would not only be interested in but lookforward to receiving on a frequent basis.
Some companies have found that sending a catalog to a
prospect from which the prospect buys creates a great opt-inbuyer who can easily become a future Web buyer. Catalogsales are dropping while Internet sales grow, but this doesn’tmean that the catalog is dead or dying. It’s still alive and welland really needed to break through the bad reputation spamhas given the Web.
The catalog qualiﬁes the buyer as a potential Internet buyer.
And so would a TV spot or a radio announcement. Your list ofcustomers culled from some other form of advertising can be-come a major source of hot prospects and future customers forInternet sales.
There are a few different formats that you can use to apply
your copywriting skills on the Web. There’s the e-mail broad-cast, the web site home page, the web catalog, the blog, the e-zine, the long sales letter and various combinations using video,links and search engine optimization to attract those prospects.
You can see how many different formats and combinations
there are and how varied each can be. So let’s take the most im-portant ones and see how the various principles you’ve learnedearly in this handbook apply. But let me warn you. A lot of whatI will describe is more marketing oriented than it is copywritingoriented. But to be a great copywriter you must learn everythingyou can about the medium you are working in. And if you knowpositively that something won’t work, you’ll save yourself oryour client a lot of time and money. So get ready for some goodmarketing tips and insights on how to make the World Wide Webwork for you.
The E-Mail Broadcast
As in direct mail, e-mail is the most personal form of communi-cation on the Web. In fact, using many of the word processingprograms, you can personalize each letter with the recipient’sname. Not only can you start the body of the e-mail with a ﬁrstor last name, but you can also add personal information or para-
300UTILIZING YOUR COPYWRITING SKILLS
======================================== [Página 325] ========================================

graphs that make each broadcast even more personal. And you
can sign each e-mail with your own signature. But be careful notto overdo it. Your letter should sound like a very personal letter,not like you’ve just discovered a new personalization techniqueand you’re overdoing it.
The principle of having a personal communication with
your prospect is important here. The more personal the better.Keep it brief. If your e-mail is too long, it appears very intimi-dating and you’ll lose the reader. Remember, the average personin business has to ﬁlter through hundreds of messages a day.Keeping your message brief and offering a link to a catalog or alonger sales message is the approach you should use.
Unlike other forms of personal communication, the great
number of e-mails received during a typical business day and theprevalence of spam mean that recipients are very jaded in whatthey will even open and read. The ﬁrst step in enticing them is toget them to read the subject line. I know that in a long list of e-mails waiting for me, the ﬁrst thing I do is scan the subject lines.If I ﬁnd one that interests me or I recognize the person or com-pany that sent it, I will open it ﬁrst. In this process, I will alsodelete the ones I don’t have time for or I know are spam.
A subject line should be brief and either let the prospect
clearly know who is sending it or cover a subject that yourprospect would be interested in. I hope your business isn’t thestock market, real estate or a pharmacy selling Viagra. It seemsthat most of the spam is from these types of companies and theaverage recipient is already deleting a lot of that with spam ﬁlters.
Your subject line is like the envelope of a direct mail cam-
paign. The envelope copy compares to a headline in a mail orderprint ad. In an e-mail, that subject line is a tough one ﬁrst to getthrough the spam ﬁlters and then to draw the attention of recipi-ents who often discard it as more spam.
Let’s say you have a great headline, one that won’t be ﬁl-
tered out by the spam ﬁlters, which delete such words as “Free”or “Viagra” or “Low Interest Rates” or—well, you get the pic-ture—seemingly all of the words that a sales message might usein a headline. Then how should the copy read?
Well, I’ve already said that the copy should be brief. Maybe
301WRITING FOR DIFFERENT MEDIA
======================================== [Página 326] ========================================

the subject line could direct the prospect someplace else where
the message is a lot longer.
Joe Vitale, proliﬁc top-selling author whose recent book is
There’s A Customer Born Every Minute (John Wiley & Sons,
2006), says that the copy should be what he calls “relationshipbuilders.” In short, don’t try to sell anything but rather develop adialogue and a level of trust with your prospect.
Get prospects to open your e-mail each time you send one
because you are sharing valuable or useful information that theyappreciate. Your words should make prospects get into the habitof opening your e-mail. By sharing this sought-after informa-tion, it is easy then to wax enthusiastic about a product that youhave and would like to sell them.
By the time you do that, the prospect feels a little guilty if
he or she doesn’t respond. Plus you’ve developed this wonderfulrapport and they feel they can trust you. You have integrity.
Vitale calls it “karmic marketing.” Do enough good by giv-
ing of yourself and your knowledge to help people and you willreap the rewards at the end. “It’s really karmic,” says Vitale.
Joe Polish, a top-niche marketing expert from Phoenix,
agrees. He says, “You need to educate and provide value in youre-mails. Only after you’ve communicated and provided valueand even bonded with the prospect do you start to offer themyour product or service.”
Polish says there are three elements to obtain good opt-in e-
mail addresses—push, pull and dangle. You pull them from yourmedia ads or any off-line activities. Then you dangle somethingfree that would interest them. And ﬁnally you push out market-ing messages. Money is made only on the last step.
Polish feels that there are two types of marketing methods:
transaction versus relationship marketing. Once you develop therelationship, it is much easier to succeed in selling somethingthan it is in strictly a transaction situation where you are sellingright off the bat. And many marketers don’t realize this.
The Long Internet Letter
Just as the long copy ads of the past 35 years have been a greatmethod of conveying the value of premium products and ser-
302UTILIZING YOUR COPYWRITING SKILLS
======================================== [Página 327] ========================================

vices, there is an equivalent on the Internet—the long letter or e-
zine (an Internet version of a sales magazine).
I have seen letters that were 32 pages long on the Web. I
have seen testimonials not only in full color with actual peopleand real names but also with sound and video. The testimonialscome alive, and you are the one who can play them simply byclicking on the control strip located below the picture.
The art in all this technology gives Internet marketers tools
they never had before and an involvement with the prospect thatwas never even imagined a decade ago.
As a copywriter you use the same principles you would
use to write that print ad but you add a few bells and whistlesto enhance your message. In general, the longer the copy, themore expensive the purchase. But regardless of how muchcopy you use, it should be so interesting and compelling thatyour prospects feel like they are on a slippery slide, unable tostop reading.
Now here is where the difference comes in between the
print ad and the Internet ad. In a print ad, the prospect knows toglance at the end of the ad to get a summary of the offer and allthe ordering information. Not so with a long Internet ad.Throughout the ad you need to have “Buy Now” buttons on al-most every screen, even at the very beginning of the ad.
In a print ad it is very helpful to have paragraph headings
to make the copy look less intimidating. That makes a lot ofsense. In a long Internet letter having paragraph headings couldserve that purpose as well. But if you make those paragraphheadings into links that go straight to your order page, you canaccomplish both—a less intimidating look and a direct link toyour order page.
I always recommend having testimonials in a print ad and
to make sure the testimonials are genuine. They become evenmore real and believable when you can include the testimonialgivers’ true names and actual hometowns.
The Internet takes the matter of testimonials one notch
higher by incorporating both audio and video. You click on the“Play” button and the person recites his or her glowing com-ments with both sound and motion. In short, you are harnessing
303WRITING FOR DIFFERENT MEDIA
======================================== [Página 328] ========================================

the advantages of television to make the testimonials that much
more impressive. And you can do that several times in a singleletter. You can put them at the beginning or the end, group themin the middle, or sprinkle them throughout the letter.
The long letter does not have to limit audio and video to
just testimonials. Often a small demonstration might makesense. Or the person making the sales presentation could do it ina video clip. But be careful. Make sure the person has good dic-tion, can speak naturally, not like he or she is reading from ascript, and looks presentable. Whether you like it or not, therewill be some out there who will judge the presenter on his or herlooks and you may evoke a negative emotion from someprospects and lose them as customers—just because they didn’tlike the presenter’s handsome face or gorgeous ﬁgure. Test theletter with and without the video or your audio sales presentationand ﬁnd out if you are creating bad emotional response.
Your picture should be in that long letter. Again, like the
testimonial, it evokes trust and conﬁdence. Prospects feel a realperson is behind the product or service they are contemplatingpurchasing.
Long copy is both informative and educational. As long as
you are providing very interesting information to somebody whois hungry for that information, the length of the letter does notmatter. Just follow the basic principles of copywriting explainedin the ﬁrst part of this handbook, incorporate a lot of the newvideo technology if it makes sense, and you will truly capture theattention, respect and trust of your prospect. And you will makeplenty of sales in the process.
The Internet Infomercial
It would stand to reason that the Internet would be the idealplace to run infomercials. After all, you’ve got the audio andvideo capabilities right on your computer—the same elementsyou see on commercial or cable TV .
And if somebody is interested in your product or service,
they’ll appreciate seeing and hearing as much information aboutit as possible.
Typically, the length of an infomercial on TV is 28
1/2min-
304UTILIZING YOUR COPYWRITING SKILLS
======================================== [Página 329] ========================================

utes. But when you are using the Web, your infomercial can be
any length you want. You can run one on TV and run it on theWeb in its full length or you can edit it to 15 minutes and run itin a shorter format. There are also a few rules to keep in mind asyou prepare an infomercial for the Web.
The ﬁrst rule is regarding price: The more expensive the
product, in general, the longer the infomercial.
The second rule covers the ordering process. Since you are
on the Web, you can make it very easy to place an order. Simplyput an “Order Now” button on your screen when you would nor-mally put the call to action. (It can be in the ﬁrst ﬁve minutes orlater in the show.) Your prospect will press the Order Now but-ton and place the order.
The third rule to remember has to do with attention span.
Your typical Internet viewer has a much shorter attention spanthan your TV viewer and is more likely to leave your site than aTV viewer is to switch channels. TV viewers are accustomed tohalf-hour segments, so once they are viewing a show they maybe less inclined to change channels. If they did, they would endup in the middle of some other program. Not so on the Internet.They can go anywhere on their computers—from checking e-mail to ﬁnding something else that might interest them. So youneed to keep your presentation interesting, fast moving, and inmost cases shorter than an infomercial on TV .
Finally, don’t forget the upsell potential on your infomer-
cial. You can do the upsell with audio and video once they’vemade the buying decision and have placed the order. Youshould also list the toll-free number. Many will not feel com-fortable placing their order on the Web and will want to talk toa real human.
Your infomercial need not be expensive. You can shoot
your program with a good quality consumer video camera. Andit could be a simple format like you being interviewed bysomebody.
You will start seeing more and more infomercials on the In-
ternet in the very near future. In fact, I predict that this will beone of the fastest growing segments on the Internet, so considerit when you look at your media mix.

The Book Promotion
One of the major changes in marketing has occurred in the book
industry. Traditionally, an author, to get his or her book onto thebest seller lists, had to go on a major public relations (PR) tourand do book signings, besides getting great reviews and spend-ing plenty of money on advertising. All that has changed as a re-sult of the Internet, and now smart authors are taking a totallydifferent route.
Here’s what a copywriter should know to write excellent
copy to create a promotion leading to a number one best seller.And here’s the good part: If you’re an author, you need none ofthe old methods you had to use before the advent of the Internet.Here’s what successful authors are doing now.
A week before the publication date of a book, an author will
create a web site in which he plugs his book and makes an offerto his opt-in list. He encourages his list to buy the book on its re-lease date, so all the response comes in at once. Each prospectwho buys the book on the very day it is released receives freegoodies worth sometimes thousands of dollars. The free goodiesoften come from the author and the author’s friends.
And these friends also sell books, have web sites, and are
happy to supply their goodies to the author because doing so en-ables them to expand their own opt-in lists. These friends thenbroadcast the author’s offer to their entire opt-in lists, too. Eachfriend’s free gift to a book purchaser has a catch to it. The freegift requires the e-mail address and name of the recipient of thefree gift in order to have access to it. This builds the friend’s opt-in e-mail list and becomes a win-win for both parties. Expandthis to a dozen friends looking to expand their opt-in lists andyou can see the viral effect this can have for the book’s successand for the friends’ ability to increase their opt-in names.
The free gifts usually cover electronic ﬁles a customer can
obtain over the Internet by downloading some report or a portionof an e-book or some similar item.
Joe Vitale offered his recent book, Life’s Missing Instruc-
tion Manual (John Wiley & Sons, 2006), along with numerous
gifts as part of the purchase if his opt-in list members would or-der through Amazon.com or Barnes&Noble.com on the publica-
306UTILIZING YOUR COPYWRITING SKILLS
======================================== [Página 331] ========================================

tion day. Over 35,000 books were quickly sold and the book was
number one on Amazon.com for four straight days.
Dozens of Vitale’s friends participated in the offer both by
supplying their own free gifts for his promotion and volunteer-ing their opt-in lists to spread the word. Millions of opt-in nameswere contacted, and the response catapulted the book to the topslot on Amazon.com. As a result of what was accomplished andthe resulting publicity associated with making the number onelist, a single chain purchased 10,000 books.
“The gifts were well thought out,” says Vitale. “You just
don’t offer any old thing but items that the prospect might buyjust on its own. I look for quality items to offer.”
Recently, Wayne Dyer, a spiritual guru and author of the
million seller Your Erroneous Zones (Funk & Wagnalls, 1976),
did a major promotion of his new best seller, Inspiration (Hay
House, 2006). He used the Internet selling method describedhere despite his best-selling-author image. In short, even estab-lished, highly respected authors are using this method. Thishandbook that you are holding was to be introduced this way. Ifyou’re just starting out with your ﬁrst book, you have the oppor-tunity to become a successful author using this method. Theplaying ﬁeld is much more level than at any other time in the his-tory of the publishing industry.
The Personal Blog
It started as a way of giving people the opportunity to expressthemselves, tell the world what they are doing and share every-thing from pictures to emotions—a great opportunity for peoplewho enjoy writing.
Web logs, or blogs, are now a major trend throughout the
world, with people in all walks of life starting them—from doc-tors to students, from housewives to authors. It is easy to set oneup, fun to watch it grow and a way to promote yourself if you area copywriter or certainly a way to share your personality andyour view of events with the world.
So if you’re a copywriter, set one up if you haven’t already
done so. And express yourself in writing each day. You’ll beamazed at how your writing will improve and how many peoplewill be interested in reading your musings.
307WRITING FOR DIFFERENT MEDIA
======================================== [Página 332] ========================================

The search engines that look for content pay considerable
attention to blogs, often placing them quite high on search re-sults lists. And one of the tips that Joe Vitale offers if you wanthigh search engine presence is to use popular events, currenttrends and famous names to get the best rankings. Vitale ran theheadline, “What I Learned from Lindsay Lohan about LosingWeight,” and it was picked up prominently by the search enginessimply because of the association with a famous personality.
Once again, a blog is a great way to expand your writing
skills. You can do reviews, entertain or even brag a little aboutwhat you do. It’s all fair game on a blog. Go for it.
The Viral Transmission
Don’t worry, it’s not a new disease and you won’t need any vac-cine. Here’s how it works. Let’s say you have a brand-name prod-uct and you want to promote the brand. Or you have a web siteand want to attract more hits. You can do what I did along with afriend, Stan Oliver, to promote the BluBlocker brand name.
Oliver has a web site that promotes his “CyberSpacers” car-
toon characters. BluBlocker has its web site that promotes itssunglasses. What Oliver did was locate an exciting video gamethat had been developed in one of the Eastern European coun-tries and obtain a license to use the game software. With the helpof a cartoonist he turned it into a game that incorporated sun-glasses, video game action and his cartoon characters.
He then made contact with a small advertising agency in
London that I visited. The agency specialized in sending broad-casts out through the Internet with games or humorous anima-tion. After they transmit the game they then monitor and rank thegame to determine how many times it has been played in whichcountry over a period of time.
Since there are several similar games or video clips, each
item is ranked according to number of hits. Within a week of ourgame’s launch, it became a major hit, scoring number one in therankings (the King Kong game promoting the 2005 movieranked second). The more than 1.5 million hits on our gamecame from many countries throughout the world. Every conti-nent and almost every major country had people playing the
308UTILIZING YOUR COPYWRITING SKILLS
======================================== [Página 333] ========================================

game. The hits to the BluBlocker web site grew as well, and the
brand became known to a whole new generation of prospects.And sales followed suit.
It was easy to understand the viral nature of the game.
When somebody played it and liked it, they referred their friendsto it, who downloaded it, played it and then recommended it toall of their friends. If you do the math, you see it doesn’t takelong for the game to circle the globe. And that’s what this gamedid. In fact, it probably is still circling the globe as you read this.
With a program like this, we added copy to our web site to
take advantage of the exposure and to suggest to those visitingus for the ﬁrst time to check out our store. As a copywriter, Ineeded to turn those visits into sales. I had to write copy to getour visitors involved with getting to know more about our line ofsunglasses.
If you have a client and he or she wants to explore the oppor-
tunities with viral broadcasts, you now know how it’s done andwhat you need to do to take advantage of this new opportunity.
The Internet Store
People love to shop on the Internet. It’s convenient and generallyfast, often beating the time needed to call a live operator to placean order.
To run a successful Internet store you have to learn a few
basic principles. First, let’s start with a few assumptions. Ideally,prospects have bought from a catalog, know the store that con-tacted them or searched on a search engine for a store sellingwhat they are looking for. They’ve also agreed to opt in for fu-ture offers.
Great. These people are now excellent prospects for future
purchases. Your Internet company then sends an e-mail broad-cast to its list. A recipient opens the e-mail to see what the com-pany has to offer.
Here’s where the offer has to be so simple that it will take
only seconds to comprehend. Let’s assume for a moment some-one purchases a leather jacket on the Internet after ﬁnding a storethat has the style she is looking for.
The package arrives quickly. This is very important. The
309WRITING FOR DIFFERENT MEDIA
======================================== [Página 334] ========================================

main advantage of buying retail is that you can bring the product
home with you. No waiting. Instant gratiﬁcation is what a retailstore offers. But when you buy through the Internet and theproduct is shipped to you, there is a lag time. To beat the retailersat their own game, Internet stores have learned to ship almost onthe same day if possible to allow that item to arrive quickly.Shipping promptly greatly reduces the advantage retail has overmail order.
Let’s get back to that company that sold the leather jacket.
The customer likes the jacket when she receives it and sees thatthe invoice states clearly how she could return it if by chance shedidn’t like it. So far, so good. The leather company has built trustin her continuing as a loyal customer. She wouldn’t mind receiv-ing e-mails from that company in the future.
Then an e-mail from the store does arrive. The subject line
is “20% Off on Leather.” And as I mentioned previously, open-ing the e-mail reveals a single simple message with a nicegraphic background. There is enough curiosity to cause her toclick on the image shown in the e-mail and connect with thestore. This ﬁrst click gets her to the web site, where she can shopfor anything else she might want to buy.
The store has a list of product categories of all its leather
products from clothes to accessories, from motorcycle jackets tofashion jackets. You then click on the category you would like toexplore and the category appears with several thumbnail photosof various products that come under this category. You then clickon the picture of the item you are interested in and immediatelyit enlarges to give you a better view of the product and some textdescribing the item.
This is where I ﬁnd a lot of companies fail. They don’t de-
scribe the items in enough detail to make the prospect feel com-fortable with their purchase. And I suspect dissatisfaction returnrates would drop if they did. But you as a copywriter reading thishandbook will know this and will provide more text in the de-scription. Just mentioning color, size and texture won’t cut it.You need something more. Maybe talk about the type of leather,where it was made, how it was sewn, what features make it bet-ter than any other similar product. Include as much information
310UTILIZING YOUR COPYWRITING SKILLS
======================================== [Página 335] ========================================

about the item as possible. People don’t mind reading about
something they are about to buy.
One of the things you want to do for your store is to make
sure that ordering is quick and easy. It has been proven that themore clicks required to consummate a purchase, the less likely itis that the purchase will be made. Requiring several clicks al-lows the potential purchaser to change his or her mind. WhenAmazon.com sends me an e-mail with a book offer, I can order itwith just a few clicks. I don’t mind spending a minute or so toorder the book, as it would have taken me an enormous amountof time to shop at a retail bookstore.
Make sure you keep your clicks to a minimum, you deliver
quickly and you describe your products fully, and you’ll have alot of success with your web site store.
The Future of the Internet
In the early 1980s I predicted in American Airlines’ in-ﬂightmagazine that the TV , the home computer and the telephonewould merge into a single entity that would provide entertain-ment, enable communications and become a great research tool.We have already reached that point and have gone well beyondit. We can now watch TV shows on our computers, we can shopthe far reaches of the world and we have at our ﬁngertips the re-search tools to ﬁnd anything we want when we want it. It truly isan amazing time we live in.
But even more amazing is the equal opportunity the Web
offers everyone reading this handbook. From aspiring entrepre-neurs to experienced marketers, the Web is offering a new andmore efﬁcient way to distribute, sell or market products and ser-vices. And we are only at the beginning of that revolution. Thereis a lot more to come.
With the ability to communicate in writing you hold one of
the keys to this fast-emerging technology—a technology to en-rich your life and indeed the lives of others.
311WRITING FOR DIFFERENT MEDIA

The material that you have read was based on an exclusive
seminar I conducted from 1977 through 2000. During this time Itaught many students who went on to build great companies andfortunes for themselves. I’m proud of them all.
And you should be proud of yourself, too, for having read
this book. You have had to read and learn a great deal. I hopeyou will use this material to contribute to your community and toyour country in a positive and productive way through the infor-mative, entertaining and effective use of advertising.
There are many businesses to build in the future. There’s
the Internet and all the opportunities associated with it. There’sthe combination of direct marketing and the new technologiesthat are only now being developed even as you read this. Con-gratulations for making the effort to succeed. 
I am not the smartest of men. Had I been smarter I would
not have made many of the mistakes I did. I would have readmore of the direct marketing books and learned more that wouldhave prevented those mistakes from ever happening. I wouldhave tested more. I would have thought more carefully beforerisking my money and my time.
I never graduated from college, my grades were not great
and I practically ﬂunked English. I’ve never taken an advertisingcourse (although that may have been the best educational break Iever had) and I’m not formally educated in many of the subjectsnecessary to ply my craft.
I am also not that much more talented than others. There are
many great writers, marketers and entrepreneurs. If you worklonger hours, if you risk more of your time and capital, eventu-ally you learn. I worked and risked a lot. And I learned a lot.
Then what do I have? I would say two things could sum me
up. The ﬁrst is the skill I have to take a very complex issue andpresent it in a very simple, understandable way—in short, my
313Some Final Thoughts Epilogue
======================================== [Página 338] ========================================

communications skill. Because of it, I therefore became a good
teacher and was able to pass along to my students the underly-ing reasons for why things work. I was able to share the manyexperiences I’ve had and point out the real lessons that Ilearned. Very often a teacher does not make a good practitionerand a practitioner does not make a good teacher. I like to think Ican do both.
The second thing I have is persistence. I don’t easily give
up. And if I do, it is not without a very good reason. To me, itwasn’t whether I won or lost that was important. It was whether Iplayed the game. And I played hard.
There comes a time in your life to step out of the trenches
and share the knowledge that you have acquired in your years ofbattle—to examine the scars and reﬂect on the lessons and theoften odd directions you’ve taken. For me, that time is right nowand this book is a product of that introspection.
Claude Hopkins, one of the early pioneers in advertising,
explained why he wrote his book My Life in Advertising in the
1920s: “Any man who by a lifetime of excessive applicationlearns more about anything than others owes a statement tosuccessors.”
If I had to pick another motivation for writing this book, it
would be my strong desire to give of myself to others. I learnedmore at my seminars by giving and sharing than I did at any timebefore or after. And aside from acquiring many insights from theseminar participants themselves, I was forced to organize and articulate my concepts to present them properly—which made mea better copywriter and marketer, as I soon started following myown advice.
Many of the seminar participants were highly motivated.
You had to be motivated to spend up to $3,000 to attend. And toget to know more than 200 of them personally—their successes,their failures and the lessons they learned—simply added to mybase of knowledge and experience. You learn from the mistakesand failures of others, and as I was sharing my mistakes and fail-ures, so were they sharing theirs. 
As mentioned in Chapter 1, Edwin Land, the inventor of the
Polaroid camera, once said, “A mistake is a future beneﬁt, the
314EPILOGUE: SOME FINAL THOUGHTS
======================================== [Página 339] ========================================

full value of which is yet to be realized.” And in that spirit many
of my mistakes became learning tools that I shared with my students and that inspired them.
I have helped many entrepreneurs build outstanding busi-
nesses and go on to contribute greatly to their industry and theircommunity. That is my greatest thrill. For if I can continue thatachievement with this book, I will have left a legacy that can livelong after I am gone.

As you can see from the diagram, by not assuming
any constraints the answer to the puzzle on page 56becomes quite simple. All too often we assume con-straints that aren’t really there. By breaking out ofthe box you can come up with incredibly effectiveanswers—whether you’re writing copy or simplysolving everyday problems. 
Assumed Constraint Examples
The following are examples of assumed constraints
from history. When somebody tells you it can’t bedone, recall these seven historical examples beforeyou become discouraged.
1.“Drill for oil? You mean drill into the ground to try to ﬁnd
oil? You’re crazy.” This was said by drillers whom wildcatterEdwin L. Drake tried to enlist in his project to drill for oil in
1859.
2.“Airplanes are interesting toys but of no military value.”
Ferdinand Foch, professor of military strategy, EcoleSuperieure de Guerre, later commander of Allied Armies
in World War I.
3.“Stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high
plateau.” Irving Fisher, professor of economics, Yale Uni-
versity, 1929.
4.“I think there is a world market for maybe ﬁve computers.”
Thomas Watson Sr., president of IBM, 1943.
5.“So we went to Atari and said, ‘Hey, we’ve got this amazing
thing, even built with some of your parts, and what do youthink about funding us? Or we’ll give it to you. We just wantto do it. Pay our salary, we’ll come work for you.’ And theysaid, ‘No.’ So then we went to Hewlett-Packard, and they said,
317Assumed Constraints, Continued Appendix A
======================================== [Página 342] ========================================

‘Hey, we don’t need you. You haven’t got through college
yet.’” This was related by Steven Jobs, Apple Computer co-
founder, on his attempts in the mid-1970s to get Atari and
Hewlett-Packard interested in his and Steve Wozniak’s per-sonal computer.
6.“A cookie store is a bad idea. Besides, the market research re-
ports say America likes crispy cookies, not soft and chewycookies like you make.” This was a response in the mid-1970sto Debbi Fields’ idea of starting Mrs. Fields Cookies.
7.“640K ought to be enough for anybody.” Bill Gates, 
Microsoft founder, 1981.

You couldn’t wait, could you? You had to turn to the back of the
book before you read the next line of copy in Chapter 10. Well,you just fell for the seeds of curiosity theory big time:
Your message must always be so compelling that you moti-
vate the reader to do things normally not done.
I realize that you might think this is a dirty trick and the story
never took place. You’re wrong on both counts. This is exactlywhat happened and this is no dirty trick. But to get people to reachinto their pockets and exchange their hard-earned dollars for yourproduct is not a natural act. It’s one of the most difﬁcult things acopywriter must do to sell a product. It requires tremendous moti-vation—motivation that needs to be generated by a compellingmessage, a message so compelling that people will become totallyinvolved with your copy, slide down the slippery slide and call orwrite to place an order or feel guilty if they haven’t.
I guess it wouldn’t be fair, now that I’ve proven my point,
to leave you hanging. After all, you were so involved with mytext that you skipped all the rest of the chapters in this book(something you normally wouldn’t do) to ﬁnd out exactly whatGinger said to me at that dramatic moment in my ofﬁce.
“Joe, I want only you to help me. I want you as my mentor—
my guide through this direct marketing jungle. I don’t know whatI can do to motivate you to help me, but I do know what most menappreciate. I’ve had men proposition me all my life but I’ve neveropenly propositioned a man. What I’m saying, Joe, is that—”
“Wait,” I said, fumbling for words as I held up one hand as
if to say stop. “You’ve got the wrong guy. Don’t embarrass your-self any further. I can no longer accept what I think you’re tryingto say. I can’t do the work for you. I’m really too busy to takeoutside projects. But attend my seminar. I’ll let you attend forfree on the condition that you pay me back after you make yourﬁrst million.”
319Seeds of Curiosity, Continued Appendix B
======================================== [Página 344] ========================================

Ginger left the ofﬁce, maybe a bit embarrassed. And I never
heard from her again. I suspect that she thought she could enticeme into writing copy by ﬂaunting her body. And would she havereally followed through? I guess I will never know.
When I returned home that evening and my wife asked me
how the day went, I replied, “Oh, I was almost seduced by a gor-geous blonde who was willing to give me her body for my copy-writing ability.”
320SEEDS OF CURIOSITY, CONTINUED
======================================== [Página 345] ========================================

The following lists summarize the axioms and major points of
copywriting that have been presented throughout this book.
Axioms
Axiom 1: Copywriting is a mental process the successful
execution of which reﬂects the sum total of all your experiences,your speciﬁc knowledge and your ability to mentally processthat information and transfer it onto a sheet of paper for the pur-pose of selling a product or service. (page 24)
Axiom 2: All the elements in an advertisement are primar-
ily designed to do one thing and one thing only: get you to readthe ﬁrst sentence of the copy. (page 29)
Axiom 3: The sole purpose of the ﬁrst sentence in an adver-
tisement is to get you to read the second sentence. (page 33)
Axiom 4: Your ad layout and the ﬁrst few paragraphs of
your ad must create the buying environment most conducive tothe sale of your product or service. (page 38)
Axiom 5: Get the reader to say yes and harmonize with
your accurate and truthful statements while reading your copy.(page 44)
Axiom 6: Your readers should be so compelled to read your
copy that they cannot stop reading until they read all of it as ifsliding down a slippery slide. (page 49)
Axiom 7: When trying to solve problems, don’t assume
constraints that aren’t really there. (page 58)
Axiom 8: Keep the copy interesting and the reader inter-
ested through the power of curiosity. (page 63)
Axiom 9: Never sell a product or service. Always sell a
concept. (page 71)
Axiom 10: The incubation process is the power of your
subconscious mind to use all your knowledge and experiences to
321Summary of Axioms and Major Points Appendix C
======================================== [Página 346] ========================================

solve a speciﬁc problem, and its efﬁciency is dictated by time,
creative orientation, environment and ego. (page 80)
Axiom 11: Copy should be long enough to cause the reader
to take the action you request. (page 85)
Axiom 12: Every communication should be a personal one,
from the writer to the recipient, regardless of the medium used.(page 92)
Axiom 13: The ideas presented in your copy should ﬂow
in a logical fashion, anticipating your prospect’s questions andanswering them as if the questions were asked face-to-face.(page 97)
Axiom 14: In the editing process, you reﬁne your copy to
express exactly what you want to express with the fewest words.(page 102)
Axiom 15: Selling a cure is a lot easier than selling a pre-
ventive, unless the preventive is perceived as a cure or the cura-tive aspects of the preventive are emphasized. (page 197)
Emotion Principles
These are the three points to remember about emotion in adver-
tising from page 66.
Emotion Principle 1: Every word has an emotion associ-
ated with it and tells a story.
Emotion Principle 2: Every good ad is an emotional out-
pouring of words, feelings and impressions.
Emotion Principle 3: You sell on emotion, but you justify
a purchase with logic.

signing a mail order ad. (Chapter 4)

Reading a number of books on a variety of subjects prepares you
to become a good direct marketer and helps you avoid many ofthe mistakes others have made. That’s one of the beneﬁts youhave realized from reading this handbook. Many other people inthe direct marketing industry have also written books that mightbe helpful to you. By reading other perspectives on advertisingand copywriting, you can further your education and avoid costlyerrors that many before you have made. I wish I had read manyof them earlier in my career.

======================================== [Página 361] ========================================

Joseph Sugarman is recognized as one of the most effective
and proliﬁc advertising copywriters in America. As CEO ofJS&A Group, Inc., he introduced hundreds of space-age elec-tronics products in the 1970s and 1980s, setting the standard forother copywriters and marketers.
He was born and raised in the Chicago area and attended
the electrical engineering college of the University of Miamifor three and a half years before being drafted into the U.S.Army in 1962.
He then spent over three years in Germany where he served
with the Army Intelligence Service and later with the CIA. Re-turning home, he formed a company to market Austrian ski liftsin the United States and then later formed his own advertisingagency to service ski resort accounts.
In 1971, after six years of running his own ad agency, he
saw microelectronics as an exciting opportunity and formed acompany to market the world’s ﬁrst pocket calculator throughdirect marketing—all from the basement of his home in North-brook, Illinois.
His company, JS&A Group, Inc., soon grew to become
America’s largest single source of space-age products, and heeventually introduced dozens of new innovations and conceptsin electronics during the 1970s and 1980s, including the pocketcalculator, the digital watch, cordless telephones, computers anda variety of other electronic items. Each product introductionwas made in large, full-page advertisements, which became therecognized signature of his creative work.
In 1973, Sugarman’s company was the ﬁrst in the United
States to use the 800 WATS line service to take credit card ordersover the telephone—something that direct marketers had neverdone before.
337About the Author
======================================== [Página 362] ========================================

In 1986, JS&A concentrated solely on its line of
BluBlocker®sunglasses, which he sold in direct mailings, mail
order ads and catalogs and on TV through infomercials, TVspots and QVC, the home shopping channel. BluBlocker Corpo-ration is currently celebrating 20 years in business with 20 mil-lion pairs sold worldwide. 
In 1979, Sugarman was selected as the Direct Marketing
Man of the Year in an award ceremony in New York. In 1991, hewon the prestigious Maxwell Sackheim award for his creativecareer contributions to direct marketing.
Sugarman is also a professional photographer, graphic de-
signer, pilot (he has a commercial instrument-rated multi-enginerating), SCUBA diver and public speaker.
He has given speeches and marketing seminars throughout
the United States as well as in Europe, Asia and Australia. Healso conducted about 20 of his own exclusive marketing semi-nars from 1977 to 2000, attracting participants from all over theworld who paid up to $6,000 to attend. These four-day eventshad a major inﬂuence on the success of his students both in theUnited States and abroad.
Sugarman is also a published author with six books to his
credit. His ﬁrst book, Success Forces , was published in 1980 by
Contemporary Books and sold 100,000 copies.
In 1999, he purchased and was the editor and publisher of
the Maui Weekly—one of the fastest growing newspapers inHawaii. He sold the paper to a West Virginia newspaper chain in2005.
