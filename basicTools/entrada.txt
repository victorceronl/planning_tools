Tenth	Anniversary	Edition	of	 Emotional	Intelligence
In	 1990,	 in	 my	 role	 as	 a	 science	 reporter	 at	 The	New	York	Times ,	 I
chanced	 upon	 an	 article	 in	 a	 small	 academic	 journal	 b y	 two
psychologists,	John	Mayer,	now	at	the	University	of 	New	Hampshire,
and	 Yale’s	 Peter	 Salovey.	 Mayer	 and	 Salovey	 offered 	 the	 first
formulation	of	a	concept	they	called	“emotional	intelligence .”
Those	 were	 days	 when	 the	 preeminence	 of	 IQ	 as	 the	 st andard	 of
excellence	 in	 life	 was	 unquestioned;	 a	 debate	 raged 	 over	 whether	 it
was	set	in	our	genes	or	due	to	experience.	But	here ,	suddenly,	was	a
new	 way	 of	 thinking	 about	 the	 ingredients	 of	 life	 s uccess.	 I	 was
electrified	by	the	notion,	which	I	made	the	title	of 	this	book	in	1995.
Like	Mayer	and	Salovey,	I	used	the	phrase	to	synthe size	a	broad	range
of	 scientific	 findings,	 drawing	 together	 what	 had	 b een	 separate
strands	 of	 research—reviewing	 not	 only	 their	 theory	 but	 a	 wide
variety	 of	 other	 exciting	 scientific	 developments,	 s uch	 as	 the	 first
fruits	 of	 the	 nascent	 field	 of	 affective	 neuroscien ce,	 which	 explores
how	emotions	are	regulated	in	the	brain.
I	remember	having	the	thought,	just	before	this	book	 was	published
ten	years	ago,	that	if	one	day	I	overheard	a	conver sation	in	which	two
strangers	 used	 the	 phrase	 emotional	intelligence 	 and	 both	 understood
what	it	meant,	I	would	have	succeeded	in	spreading	t he	concept	more
widely	into	the	culture.	Little	did	I	know.
The	 phrase	emotional	intelligence ,	 or	 its	 casual	 shorthand	 EQ,	 has
become	ubiquitous,	showing	up	in	settings	as	unlikel y	as	the	cartoon
strips	Dilbert 	and	Zippy	the	Pinhead 	and	in	Roz	Chast’s	sequential	art	in
The	New	Yorker .	I’ve	seen	boxes	of	toys	that	claim	to	boost	a	chil d’s
EQ;	 lovelorn	 personal	 ads	 sometimes	 trumpet	 it	 in	 thos e	 seeking
prospective	 mates.	 I	 once	 found	 a	 quip	 about	 EQ	 prin ted	 on	 a
shampoo	bottle	in	my	hotel	room.
And	the	concept	has	spread	to	the	far	corners	of	ou r	planet.	EQ	has
become	 a	 word	 recognized,	 I’m	 told,	 in	 languages	 as	 d iverse	 as
======================================== [Página 6] ========================================

German	 and	 Portuguese,	 Chinese,	 Korean,	 and	 Malay.	 ( Even	 so,	 I
prefer	EI	as	the	English	abbreviation	for	 emotional	intelligence. )	My	e-
mail	 inbox	 often	 contains	 queries	 from,	 for	 example,	 a 	 doctoral
student	 in	 Bulgaria,	 a	 schoolteacher	 in	 Poland,	 a	 c ollege	 student	 in
Indonesia,	a	business	consultant	in	South	Africa,	a	managemen t	expert
in	the	Sultanate	of	Oman,	an	executive	in	Shanghai.	 Business	students
in	 India	 read	 about	 EI	 and	 leadership;	 a	 CEO	 in	 Arg entina
recommends	the	book	I	later	wrote	on	that	topic.	I’ve 	also	heard	from
religious	scholars	within	Christianity,	Judaism,	Isl am,	Hinduism,	and
Buddhism	that	the	concept	of	EI	resonates	with	outlo oks	in	their	own
faith.
Most	gratifying	for	me	has	been	how	ardently	the	con cept	has	been
embraced	 by	 educators,	 in	 the	 form	 of	 programs	 in	 “soc ial	 and
emotional	learning,”	or	SEL.	Back	in	1995	I	was	able 	to	find	only	a
handful	 of	 such	 programs	 teaching	 emotional	 intellige nce	 skills	 to
children.	Now,	a	decade	later,	tens	of	thousands	of 	schools	worldwide
offer	children	SEL.	In	the	United	States	many	distri cts	and	even	entire
states	currently	make	SEL	a	curriculum	requirement,	man dating	that
just	as	students	must	attain	a	certain	level	of	compe tence	in	math	and
language,	so	too	should	they	master	these	essential	skills	fo r	living.
In	Illinois,	for	instance,	specific	learning	standa rds	in	SEL	abilities
have	been	established	for	every	grade	from	kindergar ten	through	the
last	 year	 of	 high	 school.	 To	 give	 just	 one	 example	 o f	 a	 remarkably
detailed	and	comprehensive	curriculum,	in	the	early	e lementary	years
students	should	learn	to	recognize	and	accurately	l abel	their	emotions
and	how	they	lead	them	to	act.	By	the	late	elementary 	years	lessons	in
empathy	should	make	children	able	to	identify	the	non verbal	clues	to
how	someone	else	feels;	in	junior	high	they	should	b e	able	to	analyze
what	creates	stress	for	them	or	what	motivates	their	best	perfo rmance.
And	in	high	school	the	SEL	skills	include	listening 	and	talking	in	ways
that	resolve	conflicts	instead	of	escalating	them,	a nd	negotiating	for
win-win	solutions.
Around	the	world	Singapore	has	undertaken	an	active 	initiative	in
SEL,	as	have	some	schools	in	Malaysia,	Hong	Kong,	Jap an,	and	Korea.
In	 Europe	 the	 U.K.	 has	 led	 the	 way,	 but	 more	 than	 a	 dozen	 other
countries	 have	 schools	 that	 embrace	 EI,	 as	 do	 Austra lia	 and	 New
Zealand,	and	here	and	there	countries	in	Latin	Americ a	and	Africa.	In
2002	UNESCO	began	a	worldwide	initiative	to	promote	 SEL,	sending
a	 statement	 of	 ten	 basic	 principles	 for	 implementing	 S EL	 to	 the
======================================== [Página 7] ========================================

ministries	of	education	in	140	countries.
In	some	states	and	nations	SEL	has	become	the	organiz ing	umbrella
under	which	are	gathered	programs	in	character	educa tion,	violence
prevention,	antibullying,	drug	prevention,	and	scho ol	discipline.	The
goal	is	not	just	to	reduce	these	problems	among	schoo lchildren	but	to
enhance	 the	 school	 climate	 and,	 ultimately,	 students’ 	 academic
performance.
In	1995	I	outlined	the	preliminary	evidence	suggesti ng	that	SEL	was
the	 active	 ingredient	 in	 programs	 that	 enhance	 child ren’s	 learning
while	 preventing	 problems	 such	 as	 violence.	 Now	 the	 case	 can	 be
made	scientifically:	helping	children	improve	their	s elf-awareness	and
confidence,	 manage	 their	 disturbing	 emotions	 and	 impul ses,	 and
increase	their	empathy	pays	off	not	just	in	improved	 behavior	but	in
measurable	academic	achievement.
This	 is	 the	 big	 news	 contained	 in	 a	 recently	 complet ed	 meta-
analysis	of	668	evaluation	studies	of	SEL	programs	f or	children	from
preschoolers	through	high	school. 1	The	massive	survey	was	conducted
by	 Roger	 Weissberg,	 who	 directs	 the	 Collaborative	 f or	 Academic,
Social	and	Emotional	Learning	at	the	University	of	I llinois	at	Chicago
—the	organization	that	has	led	the	way	in	bringing	S EL	into	schools
worldwide.
The	 data	 show	 that	 SEL	 programs	 yielded	 a	 strong	 ben efit	 in
academic	 accomplishment,	 as	 demonstrated	 in	 achievement	 test
results	 and	 grade-point	 averages.	 In	 participating	 schools,	 up	 to	 50
percent	of	children	showed	improved	achievement	score s,	and	up	to
38	 percent	 improved	 their	 grade-point	 averages.	 SEL	 programs	 also
made	schools	safer:	incidents	of	misbehavior	dropped	 by	an	average
of	 28	 percent;	 suspensions	 by	 44	 percent;	 and	 other 	 disciplinary
actions	by	27	percent.	At	the	same	time,	attendance	r ates	rose,	while
63	 percent	 of	 students	 demonstrated	 significantly	 mor e	 positive
behavior.	In	the	world	of	social	science	research,	 these	are	remarkable
results	 for	 any	 program	 promoting	 behavioral	 change.	 SEL	 has
delivered	on	its	promise.
In	1995	I	also	proposed	that	a	good	part	of	the	eff ectiveness	of	SEL
came	 from	 its	 impact	 in	 shaping	 children’s	 developing	 neural
circuitry,	particularly	the	executive	functions	of	 the	prefrontal	cortex,
which	manage	working	memory—what	we	hold	in	mind	as	we	l earn
—and	inhibit	disruptive	emotional	impulses.	Now	the	first	prel iminary
scientific	 evidence	 for	 that	 notion	 has	 arrived.	 Ma rk	 Greenberg	 of
Pennsylvania	State	University,	a	codeveloper	of	the	PATHS	cu rriculum
======================================== [Página 8] ========================================

in	 SEL,	 reports	 not	 only	 that	 this	 program	 for	 elemen tary	 school
students	 boosts	 academic	 achievement	 but,	 even	 more	 si gnificantly,
that	 much	 of	 the	 increased	 learning	 can	 be	 attribute d	 to
improvements	in	attention	and	working	memory,	key	funct ions	of	the
prefrontal	 cortex. 2	 This	 strongly	 suggests	 that	 neuroplasticity,	 the
shaping	of	the	brain	through	repeated	experiences,	 plays	a	key	role	in
the	benefits	from	SEL.
Perhaps	the	biggest	surprise	for	me	has	been	the	impa ct	of	EI	in	the
world	 of	 business,	 particularly	 in	 the	 areas	 of	 lea dership	 and
employee	 development	 (a	 form	 of	 adult	 education).	 The	 Harvard
Business	Review 	 has	 hailed	 emotional	 intelligence	 as	 “a	 ground-
breaking,	 paradigm-shattering	 idea,”	 one	 of	 the	 most	 influential
business	ideas	of	the	decade.
Such	claims	in	the	business	world	too	often	prove	to 	be	fads,	with
no	 real	 underlying	 substance.	 But	 here	 a	 far-flung	 network	 of
researchers	has	been	at	work,	ensuring	that	the	app lication	of	EI	will
be	grounded	in	solid	data.	The	Rutgers	University-b ased	Consortium
for	Research	on	Emotional	Intelligence	in	Organizati ons	(CREIO)	has
led	 the	 way	 in	 catalyzing	 this	 scientific	 work,	 col laborating	 with
organizations	that	range	from	the	Office	of	Personne l	Management	in
the	federal	government	to	American	Express.
Today	companies	worldwide	routinely	look	through	the	lens	of 	EI	in
hiring,	 promoting,	 and	 developing	 their	 employees.	 Fo r	 instance,
Johnson	&	Johnson	(another	CREIO	member)	found	that	i n	divisions
around	 the	 world,	 those	 identified	 at	 midcareer	 as	 h aving	 high
leadership	potential	were	far	stronger	in	EI	compete ncies	than	were
their	 less-promising	 peers.	 CREIO	 continues	 to	 foste r	 such	 research,
which	can	offer	evidence-based	guidelines	for	organ izations	seeking	to
enhance	 their	 ability	 to	 achieve	 their	 business	 goa ls	 or	 fulfill	 a
mission.
When	Salovey	and	Mayer	published	their	seminal	artic le	in	1990,	no
one	 could	 have	 envisioned	 how	 the	 scholarly	 field	 t hey	 founded
would	be	thriving	just	fifteen	years	later.	Researc h	has	blossomed	in
this	area;	while	in	1995	there	was	virtually	nothin g	in	the	scientific
literature	on	EI,	today	the	field	has	legions	of	re searchers.	A	search	of
the	 database	 for	 doctoral	 dissertations	 investigati ng	 aspects	 of
emotional	intelligence	yields	more	than	seven	hundred 	completed	to
date,	with	many	more	in	the	pipeline—not	to	mention	stu dies	done	by
======================================== [Página 9] ========================================

professors	and	others	not	counted	in	that	database. 3
The	 growth	 of	 this	 area	 of	 scholarship	 owes	 much	 to	 Mayer	 and
Salovey,	 who,	 along	 with	 their	 colleague	 David	 Caru so,	 a	 business
consultant,	 have	 worked	 tirelessly	 on	 behalf	 of	 the 	 scientific
acceptance	 of	 emotional	 intelligence.	 By	 formulating	 a	 scientifically
defensible	theory	of	emotional	intelligence	and	prov iding	a	rigorous
measure	 of	 this	 capacity	 for	 effective	 living,	 they	 have	 set	 an
impeccable	research	standard	for	the	field.
Another	major	source	of	the	burgeoning	academic	findi ngs	about	EI
has	 been	 Reuven	 Bar-On,	 now	 at	 the	 University	 of	 Te xas	 Medical
Branch	 in	 Houston,	 whose	 own	 theory	 of	 EI—and	 high-en ergy
enthusiasm—have	inspired	many	studies	using	a	measure	h e	devised.
Bar-On	has	also	been	instrumental	in	developing	and	editing	a cademic
books	 that	 have	 helped	 give	 the	 field	 a	 critical	 mas s,	 including	The
Handbook	of	Emotional	Intelligence .
The	growing	EI	field	of	study	has	met	some	entrenched 	opposition
within	the	insular	world	of	scholars	of	intelligenc e,	particularly	those
who	embrace	IQ	as	the	sole	acceptable	measure	of	human 	aptitudes.
Nevertheless,	 the	 field	 has	 emerged	 as	 a	 vibrant	 par adigm.	 Any
important	 theoretical	 model,	 observed	 the	 philosopher 	 of	 science
Thomas	 Kuhn,	 should	 become	 progressively	 revised	 and	 refined	 as
more	stringent	tests	of	its	premises	are	made.	That	pr ocess	seems	well
under	way	for	EI.
There	 are	 by	 now	 three	 main	 models	 of	 EI,	 with	 dozens 	 of
variations.	 Each	 represents	 a	 different	 perspective .	 That	 of	 Salovey
and	Mayer	rests	firmly	in	the	tradition	of	intellige nce	shaped	by	the
original	 work	 on	 IQ	 a	 century	 ago.	 The	 model	 put	 for th	 by	 Reuven
Bar-On	 is	 based	 on	 his	 research	 on	 well-being.	 And	 my	 own	 model
focuses	 on	 performance	 at	 work	 and	 organizational	 le adership,
melding	 EI	 theory	 with	 decades	 of	 research	 on	 modelin g	 the
competencies	that	set	star	performers	apart	from	average.
Unfortunately,	 misreadings	 of	 this	 book	 have	 spawned 	 some	 myths,
which	 I	 would	 like	 to	 clear	 up	 here	 and	 now.	 One	 is 	 the	 bizarre—
though	widely	repeated—fallacy	that	“EQ	accounts	for 	80	percent	of
success.”	This	claim	is	preposterous.
The	 misinterpretation	 stems	 from	 data	 suggesting	 IQ	 ac counts	 for
about	20	percent	of	career	success.	Because	that	es timate—and	it	is
only	an	estimate—leaves	a	large	portion	of	success	un accounted	for,
======================================== [Página 10] ========================================

we	 must	 seek	 other	 factors	 to	 explain	 the	 rest.	 It	 d oes	not	 mean,
however,	that	emotional	intelligence	represents	the	 rest	of	the	factors
in	success:	they	certainly	include	a	very	wide	rang e	of	forces—from
the	 wealth	 and	 education	 of	 the	 family	 we	 are	 born	 i nto,	 to
temperament,	 to	 blind	 luck	 and	 the	 like—in	 addition	 to 	 emotional
intelligence.
As	John	Mayer	and	his	associates	point	out:	“To	the 	unsophisticated
reader,	bringing	up	the	‘80	percent	unaccounted	for 	variance’	suggests
that	there	may	indeed	be	a	heretofore	overlooked	var iable	that	truly
can	predict	huge	portions	of	life	success.	Although 	that	is	desirable,
no	variable	studied	in	a	century	of	psychology	has	 made	such	a	huge
contribution.” 4
Another	 common	 misconception	 takes	 the	 form	 of	 reckless ly
applying	this	book’s	subtitle—“Why	it	can	matter	more	 than	IQ”—to
domains	like	academic	achievement,	where	it	does	not	a pply	without
careful	 qualification.	 The	 extreme	 form	 of	 this	 miscon ception	 is	 the
myth	that	EI	“matters	more	than	IQ”	in	all	pursuits.
Emotional	intelligence	trumps	IQ	primarily	in	those	“s oft”	domains
where	 intellect	 is	 relatively	 less	 relevant	 for	 suc cess—where,	 for
example,	emotional	self-regulation	and	empathy	may	be	mo re	salient
skills	than	purely	cognitive	abilities.
As	 it	 happens,	 some	 of	 these	 circumscribed	 realms	 are	 of	 major
importance	in	our	lives.	One	that	comes	to	mind	is	hea lth	(as	detailed
in	Chapter	 11 ),	 to	 the	 extent	 that	 disturbing	 emotions	 and	 toxic
relationships	 have	 been	 identified	 as	 risk	 factors	 in	 disease.	 Those
who	 can	 manage	 their	 emotional	 lives	 with	 more	 calm	 and 	 self-
awareness	seem	to	have	a	distinct	and	measurable	heal th	advantage,
as	has	now	been	confirmed	by	many	studies.
Another	 such	 domain	 is	 romantic	 love	 and	 personal	 rel ationships
(see	Chapter	9 ),	where,	as	we	all	know,	very	smart	people	can	do	v ery
dumb	 things.	 A	 third—though	 I	 have	 not	 written	 about	 it	 here—
occurs	at	the	top	levels	of	competitive	endeavors	su ch	as	world-class
sports.	 At	 that	 level,	 as	 I	 was	 told	 by	 a	 sports	 ps ychologist	 who
coaches	 U.S.	 Olympic	 teams,	 everyone	 has	 put	 in	 the	 r equisite	 ten
thousand-plus	 hours	 of	 practice,	 so	 success	 hinges	 on	 the	 athlete’s
mental	game.
Research	findings	about	leadership	in	business	and	 the	professions
paint	 a	 more	 complex	 picture	 ( Chapter	 10 ).	 IQ	 scores	 predict
extremely	well	whether	we	can	handle	the	cognitive	c hallenges	that	a
given	position	demands.	Hundreds,	perhaps	thousands,	of	stu dies	have
======================================== [Página 11] ========================================

shown	that	IQ	predicts	which	career	rungs	a	person	 can	manage.	No
question	there.
But	 IQ	 washes	 out	 when	 it	 comes	 to	 predicting	 who,	 a mong	 a
talented	 pool	 of	 candidates	 within 	 an	 intellectually	 demanding
profession,	will	become	the	strongest	leader.	In	par t	this	is	because	of
the	“floor	effect”:	everyone	at	the	top	echelons	of 	a	given	profession,
or	at	the	top	levels	of	a	large	organization,	has	a lready	been	sifted	for
intellect	 and	 expertise.	 At	 those	 lofty	 levels	 a	 hi gh	 IQ	 becomes	 a
“threshold”	ability,	one	needed	just	to	get	into	and	stay	in	t he	game.
As	I	proposed	in	my	1998	book	 Working	with	Emotional	Intelligence ,
EI	 abilities	 rather	 than	 IQ	 or	 technical	 skills	 emer ge	 as	 the
“discriminating”	competency	that	best	predicts	who	amo ng	a	group	of
very	smart	people	will	lead	most	ably.	If	you	scan	th e	competencies
that	organizations	around	the	world	have	independen tly	determined
identify	 their	 star	 leaders,	 you	 discover	 that	 indi cators	 of	 IQ	 and
technical	 skill	 drop	 toward	 the	 bottom	 of	 the	 list	 t he	 higher	 the
position.	(IQ	and	technical	expertise	are	much	stron ger	predictors	of
excellence	in	lower-rung	jobs.)
That	 point	 was	 developed	 more	 fully	 in	 my	 2002	 book	 Primal
Leadership:	Learning	to	Lead	with	Emotional	Intelligen ce	 (coauthored
with	Richard	Boyatzis	and	Annie	McKee).	At	the	very 	highest	levels,
competence	models	for	leadership	typically	consist	of 	anywhere	from
80	 to	 100	 percent	 EI-based	 abilities.	 As	 the	 head	 o f	 research	 at	 a
global	executive	search	firm	put	it,	“CEOs	are	hired 	for	their	intellect
and	 business	 expertise—and	 fired	 for	 a	 lack	 of	 emotio nal
intelligence.”
When	I	wrote	Emotional	Intelligence ,	I	saw	my	role	as	that	of	a	science
journalist,	 reporting	 on	 a	 significant	 new	 trend	 in 	 psychology,
particularly	the	merging	of	neuroscience	with	the	st udy	of	emotions.
But	as	my	involvement	in	the	field	deepened,	I	steppe d	back	into	my
old	role	as	psychologist	to	offer	my	insights	into	mo dels	of	EI.	As	a
result,	my	formulation	of	emotional	intelligence	has	p rogressed	since	I
wrote	these	pages.
In	Working	with	Emotional	Intelligence 	 I	 proposed	 an	 expanded
framework	that	reflects	how	the	fundamentals	of	EI—sel f-awareness,
self-management,	 social	 awareness,	 and	 the	 ability	 to 	 manage
relationships—translate	 into	 on-the-job	 success.	 In	 doing	 so,	 I
borrowed	a	concept	from	David	McClelland,	the	Harvard 	psychologist
who	had	been	my	mentor	in	graduate	school:	 competency .
======================================== [Página 12] ========================================

While	 our	 emotional	 intelligence 	 determines	 our	 potential	 for
learning	the	fundamentals	of	self-mastery	and	the	lik e,	our	emotional
competence 	 shows	 how	 much	 of	 that	 potential	 we	 have	 mastered	 in
ways	 that	 translate	 into	 on-the-job	 capabilities.	 T o	 be	 adept	 at	 an
emotional	competence	like	customer	service	or	teamwork	 requires	an
underlying	 ability	 in	 EI	 fundamentals,	 specifically	 social	 awareness
and	 relationship	 management.	 But	 emotional	 competencies 	 are
learned	 abilities:	 having	 social	 awareness	 or	 skill 	 at	 managing
relationships	does	not	guarantee	that	one	has	master ed	the	additional
learning	 required	 to	 handle	 a	 customer	 adeptly	 or	 to 	 resolve	 a
conflict.	 One	 simply	 has	 the	 potential	 to	 become 	 skilled	 at	 these
competencies.
Again,	an	underlying	EI	ability	is	necessary,	thoug h	not	sufficient,
to	manifest	a	given	competency	or	job	skill.	A	cognit ive	analog	would
be	 the	 student	 who	 has	 excellent	 spatial	 abilities	 yet	 never	 learns
geometry,	let	alone	becomes	an	architect.	So,	too,	ca n	one	be	highly
empathic	yet	poor	at	handling	customers—without	having 	learned	the
competency	 for	 customer	 service.	 (For	 those	 ultradedi cated	 souls
wanting	 to	 understand	 how	 my	 current	 model	 nests	 twen ty	 or	 so
emotional	competencies	within	the	four	EI	clusters,	s ee	the	appendix
to	Primal	Leadership .)
In	 1995	 I	 reported	 data	 from	 a	 nationwide,	 demographi cally
representative	 sample	 of	 more	 than	 three	 thousand	 chi ldren	 aged
seven	 to	 sixteen,	 rated	 by	 their	 parents	 and	 teache rs,	 showing	 that
over	 the	 decade	 or	 so	 between	 the	 mid-1970s	 and	 mid-1 980s,
indicators	of	emotional	well-being	among	America’s	kid s	underwent	a
marked	 decline.	 These	 children	 were	 more	 troubled	 and 	 had	 more
problems,	 ranging	 from	 loneliness	 and	 anxiety	 to	 diso bedience	 and
whining.	(Of	course,	there	are	always	individual	ex ceptions—children
who	grow	up	to	be	outstanding	human	beings—whatever	t he	overall
numbers	show.)
But	a	later	group	of	children,	rated	in	1999,	seem	t o	have	improved
markedly,	rating	far	better	than	those	in	the	late	1 980s,	though	they
were	 not	 quite	 restored	 to	 the	 levels	 recorded	 in	 t he	 mid-1970s. 5
True,	parents	are	still	likely	to	complain	in	genera l	about	their	kids,
still	 concerned	 that	 their	 children	 are	 hanging	 out 	 with	 “bad
influences,”	 and	 whining	 seems	 worse	 than	 ever.	 But	 the	 trend	 is
clearly	upward.
Frankly,	 I’m	 puzzled.	 I	 had	 conjectured	 that	 today’s 	 children	 are
======================================== [Página 13] ========================================

unintended	victims	of	economic	and	technological	prog ress,	deskilled
in	EI	because	their	parents	spend	more	time	at	work	t han	in	previous
generations,	 because	 increased	 mobility	 has	 cut	 ties 	 to	 extended
family,	 and	 because	 “free”	 time	 has	 become	 so	 structur ed	 and
overorganized.	After	all,	emotional	intelligence	has 	traditionally	been
passed	on	in	the	midst	of	everyday	life—with	parents	 and	relatives,
and	in	the	rough-and-tumble	of	free	play—opportunitie s	that	are	now
being	lost	to	the	young.
Then	there’s	the	technological	factor.	Today’s	chil dren	spend	more
time	 alone	 than	 ever	 before	 in	 human	 history,	 staring 	 at	 a	 video
monitor.	That	amounts	to	a	natural	experiment	on	an	un precedented
scale.	 Will	 these	 tech-sawy	 children	 become	 adults	 w ho	 are	 as
comfortable	 with	 other	 people	 as	 they	 are	 with	 their 	 computers?	 I
suspected,	 rather,	 that	 a	 childhood	 spent	 relating	 to	 a	 virtual	 world
would	 deskill	 our	 young	 people	 when	 it	 came	 to	 relat ing	 person	 to
person.
So	went	my	arguments.	Nothing	has	happened	in	the	las t	decade	or
so	to	reverse	these	trends.	Yet	children,	thankfull y,	seem	to	be	faring
better.
Thomas	 Achenbach,	 the	 University	 of	 Vermont	 psycholog ist	 who
has	done	these	studies,	hypothesizes	that	the	econo mic	boom	of	the
1990s	lifted	children	as	well	as	adults;	more	jobs	and	less	cri me	meant
better	 childrearing.	 Should	 there	 be	 another	 major	 e conomic
recession,	he	suggests,	we	would	see	another	declin e	in	this	measure
of	children’s	skills	for	life.	That	may	well	be;	only	time	will	t ell.
The	 hyperspeed	 at	 which	 EI	 has	 become	 a	 topic	 of	 impo rtance	 in	 a
wide	array	of	fields	makes	prediction	difficult,	but 	let	me	offer	some
thoughts	on	what	I	hope	for	the	field	in	the	near	future.
Many	 of	 the	 benefits	 that	 accrue	 from	 developing	 emot ional
intelligence	capabilities	have	gone	to	the	privileged,	suc h	as	high-level
business	executives	and	children	in	private	schools .	Of	course,	many
children	 in	 impoverished	 neighborhoods	 have	 also	 ben efited—for
instance,	if	their	schools	implemented	SEL.	But	I	enc ourage	a	further
democratization	of	this	variety	of	human	skill	develo pment,	reaching
into	often-neglected	pools,	like	families	in	poverty 	(where	children	so
often	 suffer	 emotional	 wounds	 that	 compound	 their	 pli ght)	 and	 to
prisons	 (particularly	 for	 young	 offenders	 who	 could 	 benefit
enormously	 from	 strengthening	 skills	 like	 anger	 manage ment,	 self-
awareness,	 and	 empathy).	 Given	 the	 right	 help	 with	 t hese	 abilities,
======================================== [Página 14] ========================================

their	lives	would	improve,	and	their	communities	would	be	safer .
I’d	 also	 like	 to	 see	 the	 scope	 of	 thinking	 about	 emo tional
intelligence	 itself	 expand,	 leaping	 from	 a	 focus	 on	 capacities	 within
the	 individual	 to	 a	 focus	 on	 what	 emerges	 when	 peopl e	 interact,
whether	one	on	one	or	in	larger	groups.	Some	researc h,	notably	the
University	of	New	Hampshire	psychologist	Vanessa	Drus kat’s	work	on
how	teams	can	become	emotionally	intelligent,	has	seaml essly	made
this	leap	already.	But	much	more	could	be	done.
Finally,	 I	 envision	 a	 day	 when	 emotional	 intelligenc e	 will	 have
become	so	widely	understood	that	we	need	not	mention	 it	because	it
has	melded	with	our	lives.	In	such	a	future,	SEL	wou ld	have	become
standard	practice	in	schools	everywhere.	Likewise,	 EI	qualities	such	as
self-awareness,	 managing	 destructive	 emotions,	 and	 emp athy	 would
be	 givens	 in	 the	 workplace,	 “must-haves”	 for	 being	 h ired	 and
promoted,	and	most	especially	for	leadership.	If	EI	w ere	to	become	as
widespread	 as	 IQ	 has	 become,	 and	 as	 ingrained	 in	 soc iety	 as	 a
measure	 of	 human	 qualities,	 then,	 I	 believe,	 our	 famil ies,	 schools,
jobs,	and	communities	would	be	all	the	more	humane	and	nourishing .

Aristotle’s	Challenge
Anyone	can	become	angry—that	is	easy.	But	to	be	angr y	with	the	right	person,	to	the	right
degree,	at	the	right	time,	for	the	right	purpose,	and 	in	the	right	way—that	is	not	easy .
ARISTOTLE ,	The	Nichomachean	Ethics
It	was	an	unbearably	steamy	August	afternoon	in	New	 York	City,	the
kind	of	sweaty	day	that	makes	people	sullen	with	dis comfort.	I	was
heading	 back	 to	 a	 hotel,	 and	 as	 I	 stepped	 onto	 a	 bu s	 up	 Madison
Avenue	I	was	startled	by	the	driver,	a	middle-aged	b lack	man	with	an
enthusiastic	smile,	who	welcomed	me	with	a	friendly,	“ Hi!	How	you
doing?”	 as	 I	 got	 on,	 a	 greeting	 he	 proffered	 to	 eve ryone	 else	 who
entered	 as	 the	 bus	 wormed	 through	 the	 thick	 midtown	 t raffic.	 Each
passenger	was	as	startled	as	I,	and,	locked	into	th e	morose	mood	of
the	day,	few	returned	his	greeting.
But	as	the	bus	crawled	uptown	through	the	gridlock, 	a	slow,	rather
magical	 transformation	 occurred.	 The	 driver	 gave	 a	 ru nning
monologue	for	our	benefit,	a	lively	commentary	on	the	 passing	scene
around	us:	there	was	a	terrific	sale	at	that	store, 	a	wonderful	exhibit
at	this	museum,	did	you	hear	about	the	new	movie	that	 just	opened	at
that	cinema	down	the	block?	His	delight	in	the	rich	p ossibilities	the
city	offered	was	infectious.	By	the	time	people	got	 off	the	bus,	each	in
turn	had	shaken	off	the	sullen	shell	they	had	enter ed	with,	and	when
the	 driver	 shouted	 out	 a	 “So	 long,	 have	 a	 great	 day !”	 each	 gave	 a
smiling	response.
The	 memory	 of	 that	 encounter	 has	 stayed	 with	 me	 for	 cl ose	 to
twenty	 years.	 When	 I	 rode	 that	 Madison	 Avenue	 bus,	 I	 had	 just
finished	 my	 own	 doctorate	 in	 psychology—but	 there	 was 	 scant
attention	 paid	 in	 the	 psychology	 of	 the	 day	 to	 just 	 how	 such	 a
transformation	 could	 happen.	 Psychological	 science	 k new	 little	 or
nothing	 of	 the	 mechanics	 of	 emotion.	 And	 yet,	 imaginin g	 the
spreading	 virus	 of	 good	 feeling	 that	 must	 have	 rippl ed	 through	 the
city,	 starting	 from	 passengers	 on	 his	 bus,	 I	 saw	 tha t	 this	 bus	 driver
was	 an	 urban	 peacemaker	 of	 sorts,	 wizardlike	 in	 his	 power	 to
transmute	 the	 sullen	 irritability	 that	 seethed	 in	 hi s	 passengers,	 to
soften	and	open	their	hearts	a	bit.	In	stark	contra st,	some	items	from
this	week’s	paper:
======================================== [Página 16] ========================================

•	 At	 a	 local	 school,	 a	 nine-year-old	 goes	 on	 a	 rampa ge,	 pouring
paint	 over	 school	 desks,	 computers,	 and	 printers,	 an d	 vandalizing	 a
car	in	the	school	parking	lot.	The	reason:	some	thir d-grade	classmates
called	him	a	“baby”	and	he	wanted	to	impress	them.
•	 Eight	 youngsters	 are	 wounded	 when	 an	 inadvertent	 bump	 in	 a
crowd	 of	 teenagers	 milling	 outside	 a	 Manhattan	 rap	 c lub	 leads	 to	 a
shoving	 match,	 which	 ends	 when	 one	 of	 those	 affronte d	 starts
shooting	a	.38	caliber	automatic	handgun	into	the	cr owd.	The	report
notes	 that	 such	 shootings	 over	 seemingly	 minor	 slight s,	 which	 are
perceived	 as	 acts	 of	 disrespect,	 have	 become	 increas ingly	 common
around	the	country	in	recent	years.
•	For	murder	victims	under	twelve,	says	a	report,	57	 percent	of	the
murderers	are	their	parents	or	stepparents.	In	almost 	half	the	cases,
the	parents	say	they	were	“merely	trying	to	discipli ne	the	child.”	The
fatal	 beatings	 were	 prompted	 by	 “infractions”	 such	 a s	 the	 child
blocking	the	TV,	crying,	or	soiling	diapers.
•	A	German	youth	is	on	trial	for	murdering	five	Turki sh	women	and
girls	in	a	fire	he	set	while	they	slept.	Part	of	a	 neo-Nazi	group,	he	tells
of	 failing	 to	 hold	 jobs,	 of	 drinking,	 of	 blaming	 his 	 hard	 luck	 on
foreigners.	 In	 a	 barely	 audible	 voice,	 he	 pleads,	 “ I	 can’t	 stop	 being
sorry	for	what	we’ve	done,	and	I	am	infinitely	ashamed.”
Each	 day’s	 news	 comes	 to	 us	 rife	 with	 such	 reports	 o f	 the
disintegration	 of	 civility	 and	 safety,	 an	 onslaught 	 of	 mean-spirited
impulse	running	amok.	But	the	news	simply	reflects	bac k	to	us	on	a
larger	 scale	 a	 creeping	 sense	 of	 emotions	 out	 of	 con trol	 in	 our	 own
lives	and	in	those	of	the	people	around	us.	No	one	 is	insulated	from
this	erratic	tide	of	outburst	and	regret;	it	reache s	into	all	of	our	lives
in	one	way	or	another.
The	 last	 decade	 has	 seen	 a	 steady	 drumroll	 of	 report s	 like	 these,
portraying	 an	 uptick	 in	 emotional	 ineptitude,	 desper ation,	 and
recklessness	in	our	families,	our	communities,	and	our 	collective	lives.
These	years	have	chronicled	surging	rage	and	despai r,	whether	in	the
quiet	loneliness	of	latchkey	kids	left	with	a	TV	fo r	a	babysitter,	or	in
the	pain	of	children	abandoned,	neglected,	or	abuse d,	or	in	the	ugly
intimacy	 of	 marital	 violence.	 A	 spreading	 emotional	 mal aise	 can	 be
read	in	numbers	showing	a	jump	in	depression	around	t he	world,	and
in	the	reminders	of	a	surging	tide	of	aggression—teen s	with	guns	in

employees	massacring	former	fellow	workers.	 Emotional	abuse,	drive-
by	shooting ,	 and	post-traumatic	stress 	 all	 entered	 the	 common	 lexicon
over	the	last	decade,	as	the	slogan	of	the	hour	shi fted	from	the	cheery
“Have	a	nice	day”	to	the	testiness	of	“Make	my	day.”
This	 book	 is	 a	 guide	 to	 making	 sense	 of	 the	 senseles sness.	 As	 a
psychologist,	and	for	the	last	decade	as	a	journali st	for	The	New	York
Times ,	 I	 have	 been	 tracking	 the	 progress	 of	 our	 scientif ic
understanding	of	the	realm	of	the	irrational.	From	th at	perch	I	have
been	 struck	 by	 two	 opposing	 trends,	 one	 portraying	 a	 growing
calamity	in	our	shared	emotional	life,	the	other	offe ring	some	hopeful
remedies.
WHY	THIS	EXPLORATION	NOW
The	last	decade,	despite	its	bad	news,	has	also	see n	an	unparalleled
burst	of	scientific	studies	of	emotion.	Most	dramatic 	are	the	glimpses
of	 the	 brain	 at	 work,	 made	 possible	 by	 innovative	 met hods	 such	 as
new	brain-imaging	technologies.	They	have	made	visibl e	for	the	first
time	 in	 human	 history	 what	 has	 always	 been	 a	 source	 o f	 deep
mystery:	 exactly	 how	 this	 intricate	 mass	 of	 cells	 ope rates	 while	 we
think	and	feel,	imagine	and	dream.	This	flood	of	neur obiological	data
lets	us	understand	more	clearly	than	ever	how	the	br ain’s	centers	for
emotion	move	us	to	rage	or	to	tears,	and	how	more	anci ent	parts	of
the	brain,	which	stir	us	to	make	war	as	well	as	love ,	are	channeled	for
better	 or	 worse.	 This	 unprecedented	 clarity	 on	 the	 workings	 of
emotions	and	their	failings	brings	into	focus	some	fr esh	remedies	for
our	collective	emotional	crisis.
I	 have	 had	 to	 wait	 till	 now	 before	 the	 scientific	 h arvest	 was	 full
enough	to	write	this	book.	These	insights	are	so	la te	in	coming	largely
because	 the	 place	 of	 feeling	 in	 mental	 life	 has	 been 	 surprisingly
slighted	 by	 research	 over	 the	 years,	 leaving	 the	 emo tions	 a	 largely
unexplored	 continent	 for	 scientific	 psychology.	 Int o	 this	 void	 has
rushed	 a	 welter	 of	 self-help	 books,	 well-intentione d	 advice	 based	 at
best	on	clinical	opinion	but	lacking	much,	if	any,	s cientific	basis.	Now
science	 is	 finally	 able	 to	 speak	 with	 authority	 to	 these	 urgent	 and
perplexing	questions	of	the	psyche	at	its	most	irrat ional,	to	map	with
some	precision	the	human	heart.
This	mapping	offers	a	challenge	to	those	who	subscri be	to	a	narrow
view	of	intelligence,	arguing	that	IQ	is	a	genetic	 given	that	cannot	be
======================================== [Página 18] ========================================

changed	by	life	experience,	and	that	our	destiny	in 	life	is	largely	fixed
by	 these	 aptitudes.	 That	 argument	 ignores	 the	 more	 ch allenging
question:	What	can	we	change	that	will	help	our	children	fare	better
in	life?	What	factors	are	at	play,	for	example,	when 	people	of	high	IQ
flounder	and	those	of	modest	IQ	do	surprisingly	well ?	I	would	argue
that	the	difference	quite	often	lies	in	the	abiliti es	called	here	emotional
intelligence ,	 which	 include	 self-control,	 zeal	 and	 persistence, 	 and	 the
ability	 to	 motivate	 oneself.	 And	 these	 skills,	 as	 we 	 shall	 see,	 can	 be
taught	 to	 children,	 giving	 them	 a	 better	 chance	 to	 u se	 whatever
intellectual	potential	the	genetic	lottery	may	have	given	th em.
Beyond	 this	 possibility	 looms	 a	 pressing	 moral	 imperat ive.	 These
are	times	when	the	fabric	of	society	seems	to	unravel 	at	ever-greater
speed,	when	selfishness,	violence,	and	a	meanness	of 	spirit	seem	to	be
rotting	 the	 goodness	 of	 our	 communal	 lives.	 Here	 the	 a rgument	 for
the	importance	of	emotional	intelligence	hinges	on	th e	link	between
sentiment,	character,	and	moral	instincts.	There	is	g rowing	evidence
that	 fundamental	 ethical	 stances	 in	 life	 stem	 from	 und erlying
emotional	capacities.	For	one,	impulse	is	the	medium	of 	emotion;	the
seed	 of	 all	 impulse	 is	 a	 feeling	 bursting	 to	 express 	 itself	 in	 action.
Those	who	are	at	the	mercy	of	impulse—who	lack	self-co ntrol—suffer
a	moral	deficiency:	The	ability	to	control	impulse	is 	the	base	of	will
and	character.	By	the	same	token,	the	root	of	altruism	lies	in	emp athy,
the	 ability	 to	 read	 emotions	 in	 others;	 lacking	 a	 se nse	 of	 another’s
need	 or	 despair,	 there	 is	 no	 caring.	 And	 if	 there	 a re	 any	 two	 moral
stances	that	our	times	call	for,	they	are	precisely	 these,	self-restraint
and	compassion.
OUR	JOURNEY
In	this	book	I	serve	as	a	guide	in	a	journey	throug h	these	scientific
insights	 into	 the	 emotions,	 a	 voyage	 aimed	 at	 bringin g	 greater
understanding	 to	 some	 of	 the	 most	 perplexing	 moments	 in 	 our	 own
lives	and	in	the	world	around	us.	The	journey’s	end 	is	to	understand
what	 it	 means—and	 how—to	 bring	 intelligence	 to	 emotion. 	 This
understanding	itself	can	help	to	some	degree;	bringi ng	cognizance	to
the	 realm	 of	 feeling	 has	 an	 effect	 something	 like	 the 	 impact	 of	 an
observer	 at	 the	 quantum	 level	 in	 physics,	 altering	 w hat	 is	 being
observed.
Our	 journey	 begins	 in	 Part	 One 	 with	 new	 discoveries	 about	 the
======================================== [Página 19] ========================================

brain’s	emotional	architecture	that	offer	an	explana tion	of	those	most
baffling	moments	in	our	lives	when	feeling	overwhelms	 all	rationality.
Understanding	the	interplay	of	brain	structures	that 	rule	our	moments
of	 rage	 and	 fear—or	 passion	 and	 joy—reveals	 much	 about 	 how	 we
learn	the	emotional	habits	that	can	undermine	our	bes t	intentions,	as
well	 as	 what	 we	 can	 do	 to	 subdue	 our	 more	 destructiv e	 or	 self-
defeating	emotional	impulses.	Most	important,	the	neur ological	data
suggest	a	window	of	opportunity	for	shaping	our	chi ldren’s	emotional
habits.
The	 next	 major	 stop	 on	 our	 journey,	 Part	 Two 	 of	 this	 book,	 is	 in
seeing	 how	 neurological	 givens	 play	 out	 in	 the	 basi c	 flair	 for	 living
called	emotional	intelligence: 	 being	 able,	 for	 example,	 to	 rein	 in
emotional	 impulse;	 to	 read	 another’s	 innermost	 feeling s;	 to	 handle
relationships	smoothly—as	Aristotle	put	it,	the	rare	 skill	“to	be	angry
with	the	right	person,	to	the	right	degree,	at	the	 right	time,	for	the
right	purpose,	and	in	the	right	way.”	(Readers	who	 are	not	drawn	to
neurological	detail	may	want	to	proceed	directly	to	this	sect ion.)
This	 expanded	 model	 of	 what	 it	 means	 to	 be	 “intellige nt”	 puts
emotions	 at	 the	 center	 of	 aptitudes	 for	 living.	 Part	 Three 	 examines
some	 key	 differences	 this	 aptitude	 makes:	 how	 these	 a bilities	 can
preserve	 our	 most	 prized	 relationships,	 or	 their	 lac k	 corrode	 them;
how	the	market	forces	that	are	reshaping	our	worklif e	are	putting	an
unprecedented	 premium	 on	 emotional	 intelligence	 for	 on -the-job
success;	and	how	toxic	emotions	put	our	physical	hea lth	at	as	much
risk	 as	 does	 chain-smoking,	 even	 as	 emotional	 balance 	 can	 help
protect	our	health	and	well-being.
Our	genetic	heritage	endows	each	of	us	with	a	serie s	of	emotional
set-points	 that	 determines	 our	 temperament.	 But	 the	 br ain	 circuitry
involved	is	extraordinarily	malleable;	temperament	is	 not	destiny.	As
Part	Four 	shows,	the	emotional	lessons	we	learn	as	children	a t	home
and	at	school	shape	the	emotional	circuits,	making	us 	more	adept—or
inept—at	 the	 basics	 of	 emotional	 intelligence.	 This	 me ans	 that
childhood	 and	 adolescence	 are	 critical	 windows	 of	 o pportunity	 for
setting	down	the	essential	emotional	habits	that	will	govern 	our	lives.
Part	 Five 	 explores	 what	 hazards	 await	 those	 who,	 in	 growing	 to
maturity,	 fail	 to	 master	 the	 emotional	 realm—how	 deficie ncies	 in
emotional	intelligence	heighten	a	spectrum	of	risks,	 from	depression
or	 a	 life	 of	 violence	 to	 eating	 disorders	 and	 drug	 abuse.	 And	 it
documents	 how	 pioneering	 schools	 are	 teaching	 childr en	 the
emotional	and	social	skills	they	need	to	keep	their	lives	on	tr ack.
======================================== [Página 20] ========================================

Perhaps	the	most	disturbing	single	piece	of	data	in	 this	book	comes
from	a	massive	survey	of	parents	and	teachers	and	sho ws	a	worldwide
trend	 for	 the	 present	 generation	 of	 children	 to	 be	 more	 troubled
emotionally	than	the	last:	more	lonely	and	depressed,	 more	angry	and
unruly,	 more	 nervous	 and	 prone	 to	 worry,	 more	 impulsiv e	 and
aggressive.
If	there	is	a	remedy,	I	feel	it	must	lie	in	how	we	pr epare	our	young
for	life.	At	present	we	leave	the	emotional	educatio n	of	our	children
to	 chance,	 with	 ever	 more	 disastrous	 results.	 One	 so lution	 is	 a	 new
vision	of	what	schools	can	do	to	educate	the	whole	 student,	bringing
together	 mind	 and	 heart	 in	 the	 classroom.	 Our	 journey 	 ends	 with
visits	 to	 innovative	 classes	 that	 aim	 to	 give	 childr en	 a	 grounding	 in
the	 basics	 of	 emotional	 intelligence.	 I	 can	 foresee	 a	 day	 when
education	 will	 routinely	 include	 inculcating	 essent ial	 human
competencies	 such	 as	 self-awareness,	 self-control,	 a nd	 empathy,	 and
the	arts	of	listening,	resolving	conflicts,	and	cooperatio n.
In	The	Nichomachean	Ethics ,	 Aristotle’s	 philosophical	 enquiry	 into
virtue,	 character,	 and	 the	 good	 life,	 his	 challenge 	 is	 to	 manage	 our
emotional	 life	 with	 intelligence.	 Our	 passions,	 when 	 well	 exercised,
have	wisdom;	they	guide	our	thinking,	our	values,	ou r	survival.	But
they	can	easily	go	awry,	and	do	so	all	too	often.	A s	Aristotle	saw,	the
problem	 is	 not	 with	 emotionality,	 but	 with	 the	 appropriateness 	 of
emotion	 and	 its	 expression.	 The	 question	 is,	 how	 can 	 we	 bring
intelligence	to	our	emotions—and	civility	to	our	stre ets	and	caring	to
our	communal	life?

What	Are	Emotions	For?
It	is	with	the	heart	that	one	sees	rightly;	what	is	 essential	is	invisible	to	the	eye .
ANTOINE	DE 	SAINT-EXUPÉRY ,
The	Little	Prince
Ponder	the	last	moments	of	Gary	and	Mary	Jane	Chaunce y,	a	couple
completely	 devoted	 to	 their	 eleven-year-old	 daughter 	 Andrea,	 who
was	confined	to	a	wheelchair	by	cerebral	palsy.	The 	Chauncey	family
were	passengers	on	an	Amtrak	train	that	crashed	into 	a	river	after	a
barge	 hit	 and	 weakened	 a	 railroad	 bridge	 in	 Louisia na’s	 bayou
country.	Thinking	first	of	their	daughter,	the	coup le	tried	their	best	to
save	 Andrea	 as	 water	 rushed	 into	 the	 sinking	 train; 	 somehow	 they
managed	to	push	Andrea	through	a	window	to	rescuers. 	Then,	as	the
car	sank	beneath	the	water,	they	perished. 1
Andrea’s	 story,	 of	 parents	 whose	 last	 heroic	 act	 is 	 to	 ensure	 their
child’s	 survival,	 captures	 a	 moment	 of	 almost	 mythic	 co urage.
Without	 doubt	 such	 incidents	 of	 parental	 sacrifice	 for	 their	 progeny
have	been	repeated	countless	times	in	human	history	a nd	prehistory,
and	countless	more	in	the	larger	course	of	evolution 	of	our	species. 2
Seen	 from	 the	 perspective	 of	 evolutionary	 biologists ,	 such	 parental
self-sacrifice	is	in	the	service	of	“reproductive	s uccess”	in	passing	on
one’s	genes	to	future	generations.	But	from	the	pers pective	of	a	parent
making	a	desperate	decision	in	a	moment	of	crisis,	it	 is	about	nothing
other	than	love.
As	 an	 insight	 into	 the	 purpose	 and	 potency	 of	 emotio ns,	 this
exemplary	act	of	parental	heroism	testifies	to	the	ro le	of	altruistic	love
—and	every	other	emotion	we	feel—in	human	life. 3	It	suggests	that
our	deepest	feelings,	our	passions	and	longings,	ar e	essential	guides,
and	 that	 our	 species	 owes	 much	 of	 its	 existence	 to	 t heir	 power	 in
human	affairs.	That	power	is	extraordinary:	Only	a	p otent	love—the
urgency	of	saving	a	cherished	child—could	lead	a	par ent	to	override
the	impulse	for	personal	survival.	Seen	from	the	inte llect,	their	self-
sacrifice	was	arguably	irrational;	seen	from	the	hea rt,	it	was	the	only
======================================== [Página 23] ========================================

choice	to	make.
Sociobiologists	point	to	the	preeminence	of	heart	ov er	head	at	such
crucial	moments	when	they	conjecture	about	why	evolut ion	has	given
emotion	such	a	central	role	in	the	human	psyche.	Our	 emotions,	they
say,	guide	us	in	facing	predicaments	and	tasks	too	i mportant	to	leave
to	 intellect	 alone—danger,	 painful	 loss,	 persisting	 toward	 a	 goal
despite	 frustrations,	 bonding	 with	 a	 mate,	 building	 a	 family.	 Each
emotion	 offers	 a	 distinctive	 readiness	 to	 act;	 each	 points	 us	 in	 a
direction	that	has	worked	well	to	handle	the	recurr ing	challenges	of
human	 life. 4	 As	 these	 eternal	 situations	 were	 repeated	 and	 repe ated
over	 our	 evolutionary	 history,	 the	 survival	 value	 o f	 our	 emotional
repertoire	was	attested	to	by	its	becoming	imprinted	 in	our	nerves	as
innate,	automatic	tendencies	of	the	human	heart.
A	view	of	human	nature	that	ignores	the	power	of	emot ions	is	sadly
shortsighted.	 The	 very	 name	 Homo	sapiens ,	 the	 thinking	 species,	 is
misleading	in	light	of	the	new	appreciation	and	visi on	of	the	place	of
emotions	 in	 our	 lives	 that	 science	 now	 offers.	 As	 we 	 all	 know	 from
experience,	when	it	comes	to	shaping	our	decisions	a nd	our	actions,
feeling	counts	every	bit	as	much—and	often	more—than	th ought.	We
have	gone	too	far	in	emphasizing	the	value	and	import 	of	the	purely
rational—of	 what	 IQ	 measures—in	 human	 life.	 For	 better	 or	 worse,
intelligence	can	come	to	nothing	when	the	emotions	hold	sway.
WHEN	PASSIONS	OVERWHELM	REASON
It	was	a	tragedy	of	errors.	Fourteen-year-old	Matil da	Crabtree	was	just
playing	a	practical	joke	on	her	father:	she	jumped	o ut	of	a	closet	and
yelled	“Boo!”	as	her	parents	came	home	at	one	in	the	 morning	from
visiting	friends.
But	Bobby	Crabtree	and	his	wife	thought	Matilda	was 	staying	with
friends	 that	 night.	 Hearing	 noises	 as	 he	 entered	 the 	 house,	 Crabtree
reached	for	his	.357	caliber	pistol	and	went	into	M atilda’s	bedroom	to
investigate.	When	his	daughter	jumped	from	the	closet ,	Crabtree	shot
her	in	the	neck.	Matilda	Crabtree	died	twelve	hours	later. 5
One	emotional	legacy	of	evolution	is	the	fear	that	mo bilizes	us	to
protect	our	family	from	danger;	that	impulse	impelled	B obby	Crabtree
to	get	his	gun	and	search	his	house	for	the	intrude r	he	thought	was
prowling	there.	Fear	primed	Crabtree	to	shoot	before 	he	could	fully
register	what	he	was	shooting	at,	even	before	he	co uld	recognize	his
======================================== [Página 24] ========================================

daughter’s	voice.	Automatic	reactions	of	this	sort	h ave	become	etched
in	our	nervous	system,	evolutionary	biologists	presu me,	because	for	a
long	and	crucial	period	in	human	prehistory	they	made 	the	difference
between	survival	and	death.	Even	more	important,	they 	mattered	for
the	 main	 task	 of	 evolution:	 being	 able	 to	 bear	 proge ny	 who	 would
carry	 on	 these	 very	 genetic	 predispositions—a	 sad	 ir ony,	 given	 the
tragedy	at	the	Crabtree	household.
But	while	our	emotions	have	been	wise	guides	in	the	 evolutionary
long	run,	the	new	realities	civilization	presents	h ave	arisen	with	such
rapidity	that	the	slow	march	of	evolution	cannot	kee p	up.	Indeed,	the
first	laws	and	proclamations	of	ethics—the	Code	of	Hammu rabi,	the
Ten	Commandments	of	the	Hebrews,	the	Edicts	of	Emperor	A shoka—
can	 be	 read	 as	 attempts	 to	 harness,	 subdue,	 and	 domes ticate
emotional	 life.	 As	 Freud	 described	 in	 Civilization	and	Its	Discontents ,
society	has	had	to	enforce	from	without	rules	meant	to	subdue	ti des	of
emotional	excess	that	surge	too	freely	within.
Despite	 these	 social	 constraints,	 passions	 overwhel m	 reason	 time
and	 again.	 This	 given	 of	 human	 nature	 arises	 from	 the 	 basic
architecture	of	mental	life.	In	terms	of	biological	d esign	for	the	basic
neural	 circuitry	 of	 emotion,	 what	 we	 are	 born	 with	 i s	 what	 worked
best	 for	 the	 last	 50,000	 human	 generations,	 not	 the	 last	 500
generations—and	 certainly	 not	 the	 last	 five.	 The	 slo w,	 deliberate
forces	 of	 evolution	 that	 have	 shaped	 our	 emotions	 ha ve	 done	 their
work	over	the	course	of	a	million	years;	the	last	10,000	years—d espite
having	 witnessed	 the	 rapid	 rise	 of	 human	 civilizatio n	 and	 the
explosion	of	the	human	population	from	five	million	to 	five	billion—
have	left	little	imprint	on	our	biological	templates	for	emotio nal	life.
For	better	or	for	worse,	our	appraisal	of	every	per sonal	encounter
and	our	responses	to	it	are	shaped	not	just	by	our	 rational	judgments
or	 our	 personal	 history,	 but	 also	 by	 our	 distant	 an cestral	 past.	 This
leaves	us	with	sometimes	tragic	propensities,	as	witn ess	the	sad	events
at	the	Crabtree	household.	In	short,	we	too	often	c onfront	postmodern
dilemmas	with	an	emotional	repertoire	tailored	to	the	 urgencies	of	the
Pleistocene.	That	predicament	is	at	the	heart	of	my	subject.
Impulses	to	Action
One	early	spring	day	I	was	driving	along	a	highway	 over	a	mountain
pass	in	Colorado,	when	a	snow	flurry	suddenly	blott ed	out	the	car	a
few	 lengths	 ahead	 of	 me.	 As	 I	 peered	 ahead	 I	 couldn’ t	 make	 out
======================================== [Página 25] ========================================

anything;	the	swirling	snow	was	now	a	blinding	whit eness.	Pressing
my	foot	on	the	brake,	I	could	feel	anxiety	flood	my	b ody	and	hear	the
thumping	of	my	heart.
The	anxiety	built	to	full	fear:	I	pulled	over	to	th e	side	of	the	road,
waiting	 for	 the	 flurry	 to	 pass.	 A	 half	 hour	 later	 t he	 snow	 stopped,
visibility	returned,	and	I	continued	on	my	way—only	t o	be	stopped	a
few	 hundred	 yards	 down	 the	 road,	 where	 an	 ambulance	 crew	 was
helping	a	passenger	in	a	car	that	had	rear-ended	a	 slower	car	in	front;
the	collision	blocked	 the	highway.	If	 I	had	continu ed	 driving	in	the
blinding	snow,	I	probably	would	have	hit	them.
The	 caution	 fear	 forced	 on	 me	 that	 day	 may	 have	 saved 	 my	 life.
Like	 a	 rabbit	 frozen	 in	 terror	 at	 the	 hint	 of	 a	 pas sing	 fox—or	 a
protomammal	hiding	from	a	marauding	dinosaur—I	was	overta ken	by
an	internal	state	that	compelled	me	to	stop,	pay	atte ntion,	and	take
heed	of	a	coming	danger.
All	emotions	are,	in	essence,	impulses	to	act,	the	in stant	plans	for
handling	 life	 that	 evolution	 has	 instilled	 in	 us.	 T he	 very	 root	 of	 the
word	emotion 	is	motere ,	the	Latin	verb	“to	move,”	plus	the	prefix	“e-”
to	connote	“move	away,”	suggesting	that	a	tendency	t o	act	is	implicit
in	 every	 emotion.	 That	 emotions	 lead	 to	 actions	 is	 mos t	 obvious	 in
watching	 animals	 or	 children;	 it	 is	 only	 in	 “civiliz ed”	 adults	 we	 so
often	find	the	great	anomaly	in	the	animal	kingdom,	emo tions—root
impulses	to	act—divorced	from	obvious	reaction. 6
In	 our	 emotional	 repertoire	 each	 emotion	 plays	 a	 uniq ue	 role,	 as
revealed	by	their	distinctive	biological	signatures 	(see	 Appendix	A 	for
details	on	“basic”	emotions).	With	new	methods	to	pee r	into	the	body
and	 brain,	 researchers	 are	 discovering	 more	 physiolo gical	 details	 of
how	 each	 emotion	 prepares	 the	 body	 for	 a	 very	 differ ent	 kind	 of
response: 7
•	With	anger 	blood	flows	to	the	hands,	making	it	easier	to	grasp 	a
weapon	or	strike	at	a	foe;	heart	rate	increases,	an d	a	rush	of	hormones
such	 as	 adrenaline	 generates	 a	 pulse	 of	 energy	 stro ng	 enough	 for
vigorous	action.
•	With	fear	blood	goes	to	the	large	skeletal	muscles,	such	as	i n	the
legs,	making	it	easier	to	flee—and	making	the	face	bla nch	as	blood	is
shunted	away	from	it	(creating	the	feeling	that	the	 blood	“runs	cold”).
At	 the	 same	 time,	 the	 body	 freezes,	 if	 only	 for	 a	 momen t,	 perhaps
allowing	 time	 to	 gauge	 whether	 hiding	 might	 be	 a	 bett er	 reaction.
Circuits	in	the	brain’s	emotional	centers	trigger	a	 flood	of	hormones
======================================== [Página 26] ========================================

that	 put	 the	 body	 on	 general	 alert,	 making	 it	 edgy	 a nd	 ready	 for
action,	 and	 attention	 fixates	 on	 the	 threat	 at	 hand ,	 the	 better	 to
evaluate	what	response	to	make.
•	 Among	 the	 main	 biological	 changes	 in	 happiness 	 is	 an	 increased
activity	in	a	brain	center	that	inhibits	negative	f eelings	and	fosters	an
increase	 in	 available	 energy,	 and	 a	 quieting	 of	 tho se	 that	 generate
worrisome	thought.	But	there	is	no	particular	shift	 in	physiology	save
a	quiescence,	which	makes	the	body	recover	more	quick ly	from	the
biological	arousal	of	upsetting	emotions.	This	confi guration	offers	the
body	a	general	rest,	as	well	as	readiness	and	enthu siasm	for	whatever
task	is	at	hand	and	for	striving	toward	a	great	variety	of	goal s.
•	Love,	 tender	 feelings,	 and	 sexual	 satisfaction	 entail
parasympathetic	arousal—the	physiological	opposite	of 	the	“fight-or-
flight”	 mobilization	 shared	 by	 fear	 and	 anger.	 The	 p arasympathetic
pattern,	 dubbed	 the	 “relaxation	 response,”	 is	 a	 bod ywide	 set	 of
reactions	 that	 generates	 a	 general	 state	 of	 calm	 and 	 contentment,
facilitating	cooperation.
•	 The	 lifting	 of	 the	 eyebrows	 in	 surprise 	 allows	 the	 taking	 in	 of	 a
larger	visual	sweep	 and	also	permits	 more	light	to	 st rike	the	retina.
This	offers	more	information	about	the	unexpected	eve nt,	making	it
easier	to	figure	out	exactly	what	is	going	on	and	c oncoct	the	best	plan
for	action.
•	 Around	 the	 world	 an	 expression	 of	 disgust 	 looks	 the	 same,	 and
sends	the	identical	message:	something	is	offensive	i n	taste	or	smell,
or	metaphorically	so.	The	facial	expression	of	disgu st—the	upper	lip
curled	to	the	side	as	the	nose	wrinkles	slightly—sug gests	a	primordial
attempt,	 as	 Darwin	 observed,	 to	 close	 the	 nostrils	 a gainst	 a	 noxious
odor	or	to	spit	out	a	poisonous	food.
•	A	main	function	for	 sadness 	is	to	help	adjust	to	a	significant	loss,
such	 as	 the	 death	 of	 someone	 close	 or	 a	 major	 disappo intment.
Sadness	 brings	 a	 drop	 in	 energy	 and	 enthusiasm	 for	 l ife’s	 activities,
particularly	 diversions	 and	 pleasures,	 and,	 as	 it	 d eepens	 and
approaches	 depression,	 slows	 the	 body’s	 metabolism.	 T his
introspective	 withdrawal	 creates	 the	 opportunity	 to 	 mourn	 a	 loss	 or
frustrated	hope,	grasp	its	consequences	for	one’s	l ife,	and,	as	energy
returns,	plan	new	beginnings.	This	loss	of	energy	ma y	well	have	kept
saddened—and	vulnerable—early	humans	close	to	home,	whe re	they
were	safer.
These	biological	propensities	to	act	are	shaped	fur ther	by	our	life
======================================== [Página 27] ========================================

experience	 and	 our	 culture.	 For	 instance,	 universal ly	 the	 loss	 of	 a
loved	one	elicits	sadness	and	grief.	But	how	we	sho w	our	grieving—
how	 emotions	 are	 displayed	 or	 held	 back	 for	 private	 moments—is
molded	by	culture,	as	are	which	particular	people	in 	our	lives	fall	into
the	category	of	“loved	ones”	to	be	mourned.
The	protracted	period	of	evolution	when	these	emotio nal	responses
were	hammered	into	shape	was	certainly	a	harsher	real ity	than	most
humans	 endured	 as	 a	 species	 after	 the	 dawn	 of	 record ed	 history.	 It
was	a	time	when	few	infants	survived	to	childhood	an d	few	adults	to
thirty	 years,	 when	 predators	 could	 strike	 at	 any	 mome nt,	 when	 the
vagaries	 of	 droughts	 and	 floods	 meant	 the	 difference 	 between
starvation	and	survival.	But	with	the	coming	of	agri culture	and	even
the	most	rudimentary	human	societies,	the	odds	for	sur vival	began	to
change	 dramatically.	 In	 the	 last	 ten	 thousand	 years, 	 when	 these
advances	took	hold	throughout	the	world,	the	feroci ous	pressures	that
had	held	the	human	population	in	check	eased	steadily.
Those	 same	 pressures	 had	 made	 our	 emotional	 responses	 so
valuable	 for	 survival;	 as	 they	 waned,	 so	 did	 the	 go odness	 of	 fit	 of
parts	 of	 our	 emotional	 repertoire.	 While	 in	 the	 anci ent	 past	 a	 hair-
trigger	 anger	 may	 have	 offered	 a	 crucial	 edge	 for	 su rvival,	 the
availability	of	automatic	weaponry	to	thirteen-year- olds	has	made	it
too	often	a	disastrous	reaction. 8
Our	Two	Minds
A	friend	was	telling	me	about	her	divorce,	a	painful 	separation.	Her
husband	 had	 fallen	 in	 love	 with	 a	 younger	 woman	 at	 w ork,	 and
suddenly	 announced	 he	 was	 leaving	 to	 live	 with	 the	 other	 woman.
Months	 of	 bitter	 wrangling	 over	 house,	 money,	 and	 cu stody	 of	 the
children	followed.	Now,	some	months	later,	she	was	sa ying	that	her
independence	was	appealing	to	her,	that	she	was	hap py	to	be	on	her
own.	“I	just	don’t	think	about	him	anymore—I	really	do n’t	care,”	she
said.	But	as	she	said	it,	her	eyes	momentarily	welled	up	with	tea rs.
That	 moment	 of	 teary	 eyes	 could	 easily	 pass	 unnoted.	 But	 the
empathic	 understanding	 that	 someone’s	 watering	 eyes	 me ans	 she	 is
sad	despite	her	words	to	the	contrary	is	an	act	of	 comprehending	just
as	surely	as	is	distilling	meaning	from	words	on	a	pr inted	page.	One	is
an	act	of	the	emotional	mind,	the	other	of	the	ration al	mind.	In	a	very
real	sense	we	have	two	minds,	one	that	thinks	and	one	that	feels .
These	 two	 fundamentally	 different	 ways	 of	 knowing	 in teract	 to
======================================== [Página 28] ========================================

construct	 our	 mental	 life.	 One,	 the	 rational	 mind,	 is 	 the	 mode	 of
comprehension	 we	 are	 typically	 conscious	 of:	 more	 pro minent	 in
awareness,	thoughtful,	able	to	ponder	and	reflect.	 But	alongside	that
there	 is	 another	 system	 of	 knowing:	 impulsive	 and	 pow erful,	 if
sometimes	 illogical—the	 emotional	 mind.	 (For	 a	 more	 detai led
description	of	the	characteristics	of	the	emotional	 mind,	see	 Appendix
B.)
The	emotional/rational	dichotomy	approximates	the	folk 	distinction
between	 “heart”	 and	 “head”;	 knowing	 something	 is	 rig ht	 “in	 your
heart”	is	a	different	order	of	conviction—somehow	a	d eeper	kind	of
certainty—than	thinking	so	with	your	rational	mind.	T here	is	a	steady
gradient	 in	 the	 ratio	 of	 rational-to-emotional	 contr ol	 over	 the	 mind;
the	more	intense	the	feeling,	the	more	dominant	the	emo tional	mind
becomes—and	 the	 more	 ineffectual	 the	 rational.	 This	 is 	 an
arrangement	that	seems	to	stem	from	eons	of	evolutionar y	advantage
to	having	emotions	and	intuitions	guide	our	instanta neous	response	in
situations	 where	 our	 lives	 are	 in	 peril—and	 where	 pa using	 to	 think
over	what	to	do	could	cost	us	our	lives.
These	two	minds,	the	emotional	and	the	rational,	oper ate	in	tight
harmony	for	the	most	part,	intertwining	their	very	di fferent	ways	of
knowing	to	guide	us	through	the	world.	Ordinarily	t here	is	a	balance
between	emotional	and	rational	minds,	with	emotion	fee ding	into	and
informing	the	operations	of	the	rational	mind,	and	th e	rational	mind
refining	and	sometimes	vetoing	the	inputs	of	the	emoti ons.	Still,	the
emotional	and	rational	minds	are	semi-independent	facu lties,	each,	as
we	shall	see,	reflecting	the	operation	of	distinct, 	but	interconnected,
circuitry	in	the	brain.
In	many	or	most	moments	these	minds	are	exquisitely	coor dinated;
feelings	 are	 essential	 to	 thought,	 thought	 to	 feeli ng.	 But	 when
passions	surge	the	balance	tips:	it	is	the	emotional 	mind	that	captures
the	 upper	 hand,	 swamping	 the	 rational	 mind.	 The	 sixte enth-century
humanist	 Erasmus	 of	 Rotterdam	 wrote	 in	 a	 satirical	 vei n	 of	 this
perennial	tension	between	reason	and	emotion: 9
Jupiter	has	bestowed	far	more	passion	than	reason—you	co uld	calculate	the	ratio	as	24
to	one.	He	set	up	two	raging	tyrants	in	opposition	 to	Reason’s	solitary	power:	anger
and	 lust.	 How	 far	 Reason	 can	 prevail	 against	 the	 combi ned	 forces	 of	 these	 two	 the
common	life	of	man	makes	quite	clear.	Reason	does	the	only 	thing	she	can	and	shouts
herself	 hoarse,	 repeating	 formulas	 of	 virtue,	 while	 the	 ot her	 two	 bid	 her	 go	 hang
herself,	and	are	increasingly	noisy	and	offensive,	unti l	at	last	their	Ruler	is	exhausted,

gives	up,	and	surrenders.
HOW	THE	BRAIN	GREW
To	better	grasp	the	potent	hold	of	the	emotions	on	t he	thinking	mind
—and	why	feeling	and	reason	are	so	readily	at	war—con sider	how	the
brain	evolved.	Human	 brains,	with	their	 three	pounds	 or	 so	of	cells
and	 neural	 juices,	 are	 about	 triple	 the	 size	 of	 tho se	 in	 our	 nearest
cousins	in	evolution,	the	nonhuman	primates.	Over	mill ions	of	years
of	evolution,	the	brain	has	grown	from	the	bottom	up, 	with	its	higher
centers	developing	as	elaborations	of	lower,	more	an cient	parts.	(The
growth	 of	 the	 brain	 in	 the	 human	 embryo	 roughly	 retra ces	 this
evolutionary	course.)
The	 most	 primitive	 part	 of	 the	 brain,	 shared	 with	 all 	 species	 that
have	 more	 than	 a	 minimal	 nervous	 system,	 is	 the	 brainst em
surrounding	the	top	of	the	spinal	cord.	This	root	b rain	regulates	basic
life	functions	like	breathing	and	the	metabolism	of	t he	body’s	other
organs,	 as	 well	 as	 controlling	 stereotyped	 reaction s	 and	 movements.
This	primitive	brain	cannot	be	said	to	think	or	lear n;	rather	it	is	a	set
of	preprogrammed	regulators	that	keep	the	body	runnin g	as	it	should
and	 reacting	 in	 a	 way	 that	 ensures	 survival.	 This	 b rain	 reigned
supreme	in	the	Age	of	the	Reptiles:	Picture	a	snake	 hissing	to	signal
the	threat	of	an	attack.
From	 the	 most	 primitive	 root,	 the	 brainstem,	 emerged	 the
emotional	 centers.	 Millions	 of	 years	 later	 in	 evolut ion,	 from	 these
emotional	areas	evolved	the	thinking	brain	or	“neoco rtex,”	the	great
bulb	of	convoluted	tissues	that	make	up	the	top	laye rs.	The	fact	that
the	thinking	brain	grew	from	the	emotional	reveals	muc h	about	the
relationship	of	thought	to	feeling;	there	was	an	emo tional	brain	long
before	there	was	a	rational	one.
The	most	ancient	root	of	our	emotional	life	is	in	the 	sense	of	smell,
or,	 more	 precisely,	 in	 the	 olfactory	 lobe,	 the	 cells 	 that	 take	 in	 and
analyze	smell.	Every	living	entity,	be	it	nutritious ,	poisonous,	sexual
partner,	 predator	 or	 prey,	 has	 a	 distinctive	 molecul ar	 signature	 that
can	be	carried	in	the	wind.	In	those	primitive	times	 smell	commended
itself	as	a	paramount	sense	for	survival.
From	 the	 olfactory	 lobe	 the	 ancient	 centers	 for	 emoti on	 began	 to
evolve,	 eventually	 growing	 large	 enough	 to	 encircle 	 the	 top	 of	 the
brainstem.	 In	 its	 rudimentary	 stages,	 the	 olfactory	 c enter	 was
======================================== [Página 30] ========================================

composed	 of	 little	 more	 than	 thin	 layers	 of	 neurons	 g athered	 to
analyze	smell.	One	layer	of	cells	took	in	what	was	s melled	and	sorted
it	out	into	the	relevant	categories:	edible	or	toxi c,	sexually	available,
enemy	 or	 meal.	 A	 second	 layer	 of	 cells	 sent	 reflexive 	 messages
throughout	the	nervous	system	telling	the	body	what	 to	do:	bite,	spit,
approach,	flee,	chase. 10
With	the	arrival	of	the	first	mammals	came	new,	key	lay ers	of	the
emotional	brain.	These,	surrounding	the	brainstem,	lo ok	roughly	like
a	 bagel	 with	 a	 bite	 taken	 out	 at	 the	 bottom	 where	 th e	 brainstem
nestles	into	them.	Because	this	part	of	the	brain	ri ngs	and	borders	the
brainstem,	it	was	called	the	“limbic”	system,	from	“limb us,”	the	Latin
word	for	“ring.”	This	new	neural	territory	added	emo tions	proper	to
the	brain’s	repertoire. 11	When	we	are	in	the	grip	of	craving	or	fury,
head-over-heels	in	love	or	recoiling	in	dread,	it	i s	the	limbic	system
that	has	us	in	its	grip.
As	it	evolved,	the	limbic	system	refined	two	powerful	tools:	le arning
and	memory.	These	revolutionary	advances	allowed	an	a nimal	to	be
much	smarter	in	its	choices	for	survival,	and	to	fine -tune	its	responses
to	 adapt	 to	 changing	 demands	 rather	 than	 having	 inva riable	 and
automatic	reactions.	If	a	food	led	to	sickness,	it	c ould	be	avoided	next
time.	Decisions	like	knowing	what	to	eat	and	what	to	 spurn	were	still
determined	 largely	 through	 smell;	 the	 connections	 bet ween	 the
olfactory	bulb	and	the	limbic	system	now	took	on	the	 tasks	of	making
distinctions	among	smells	and	recognizing	them,	compari ng	a	present
smell	with	past	ones,	and	so	discriminating	good	from	 bad.	This	was
done	by	the	“rhinencephalon,”	literally,	the	“nose	 brain,”	a	part	of	the
limbic	 wiring,	 and	 the	 rudimentary	 basis	 of	 the	 neoco rtex,	 the
thinking	brain.
About	 100	 million	 years	 ago	 the	 brain	 in	 mammals	 took	 a 	 great
growth	spurt.	Piled	on	top	of	the	thin	two-layered	 cortex—the	regions
that	plan,	comprehend	what	is	sensed,	coordinate	move ment—several
new	 layers	 of	 brain	 cells	 were	 added	 to	 form	 the	 neo cortex.	 In
contrast	 to	 the	 ancient	 brain’s	 two-layered	 cortex, 	 the	 neocortex
offered	an	extraordinary	intellectual	edge.
The	Homo	sapiens 	 neocortex,	 so	 much	 larger	 than	 in	 any	 other
species,	has	added	all	that	is	distinctly	human.	The 	neocortex	is	the
seat	 of	 thought;	 it	 contains	 the	 centers	 that	 put	 t ogether	 and
comprehend	 what	 the	 senses	 perceive.	 It	 adds	 to	 a	 fe eling	 what	 we
think	 about	 it—and	 allows	 us	 to	 have	 feelings	 about	 ideas,	 art,
symbols,	imaginings.
======================================== [Página 31] ========================================

In	evolution	the	neocortex	allowed	a	judicious	fine -tuning	that	no
doubt	 has	 made	 enormous	 advantages	 in	 an	 organism’s	 ab ility	 to
survive	adversity,	making	it	more	likely	that	its	progeny	woul d	in	turn
pass	on	the	genes	that	contain	that	same	neural	circ uitry.	The	survival
edge	 is	 due	 to	 the	 neocortex’s	 talent	 for	 strategiz ing,	 long-term
planning,	and	other	mental	wiles.	Beyond	that,	the	t riumphs	of	art,	of
civilization	and	culture,	are	all	fruits	of	the	neocortex.
This	 new	 addition	 to	 the	 brain	 allowed	 the	 addition 	 of	 nuance	 to
emotional	 life.	 Take	 love.	 Limbic	 structures	 generate 	 feelings	 of
pleasure	and	sexual	desire—the	emotions	that	feed	sex ual	passion.	But
the	addition	of	the	neocortex	and	its	connections	t o	the	limbic	system
allowed	for	the	mother-child	bond	that	is	the	basis	 of	the	family	unit
and	 the	 long-term	 commitment	 to	 childrearing	 that	 makes	 human
development	 possible.	 (Species	 that	 have	 no	 neocorte x,	 such	 as
reptiles,	 lack	 maternal	 affection;	 when	 their	 young	 hatch,	 the
newborns	 must	 hide	 to	 avoid	 being	 cannibalized.)	 In	 humans	 the
protective	bond	between	parent	and	child	allows	much 	of	maturation
to	go	on	over	the	course	of	a	long	childhood—during	 which	the	brain
continues	to	develop.
As	we	proceed	up	the	phylogenetic	scale	from	reptile 	to	rhesus	to
human,	the	sheer	mass	of	the	neocortex	increases;	wit h	that	increase
comes	a	geometrie	rise	in	the	interconnections	in	bra in	circuitry.	The
larger	 the	 number	 of	 such	 connections,	 the	 greater	 t he	 range	 of
possible	 responses.	 The	 neocortex	 allows	 for	 the	 su btlety	 and
complexity	of	emotional	life,	such	as	the	ability	to	 have	feelings	about
our	 feelings.	 There	 is	 more	 neocortex-to-limbic	 syste m	 in	 primates
than	 in	 other	 species—and	 vastly	 more	 in	 humans—suggest ing	 why
we	are	able	to	display	a	far	greater	range	of	react ions	to	our	emotions,
and	 more	 nuance.	 While	 a	 rabbit	 or	 rhesus	 has	 a	 rest ricted	 set	 of
typical	 responses	 to	 fear,	 the	 larger	 human	 neocorte x	 allows	 a	 far
more	nimble	repertoire—including	calling	911.	The	more	 complex	the
social	 system,	 the	 more	 essential	 is	 such	 flexibility —and	 there	 is	 no
more	complex	social	world	than	our	own. 12
But	 these	 higher	 centers	 do	 not	 govern	 all	 of	 emotio nal	 life;	 in
crucial	 matters	 of	 the	 heart—and	 most	 especially	 in	 emo tional
emergencies—they	can	be	said	to	defer	to	the	limbic	sy stem.	Because
so	many	of	the	brain’s	higher	centers	sprouted	from	o r	extended	the
scope	of	the	limbic	area,	the	emotional	brain	plays	a 	crucial	role	in
neural	architecture.	As	the	root	from	which	the	newe r	brain	grew,	the
emotional	areas	are	intertwined	via	myriad	connecting 	circuits	to	all
======================================== [Página 32] ========================================

parts	 of	 the	 neocortex.	 This	 gives	 the	 emotional	 cen ters	 immense
power	to	influence	the	functioning	of	the	rest	of	t he	brain—including
its	centers	for	thought.

Anatomy	of	an	Emotional	Hijacking
Life	is	a	comedy	for	those	who	think	and	a	tragedy	f or	those	who	feel .
HORACE 	WALPOLE
It	 was	 a	 hot	 August	 afternoon	 in	 1963,	 the	 same	 day	 that	 the	 Rev.
Martin	Luther	King,	Jr.,	gave	his	“I	Have	a	Dream”	sp eech	to	a	civil
rights	march	on	Washington.	On	that	day	Richard	Robl es,	a	seasoned
burglar	who	had	just	been	paroled	from	a	three-year	 sentence	for	the
more	than	one	hundred	break-ins	he	had	pulled	to	sup port	a	heroin
habit,	decided	to	do	one	more.	He	wanted	to	renounce 	crime,	Robles
later	claimed,	but	he	desperately	needed	money	for	hi s	girlfriend	and
their	three-year-old	daughter.
The	 apartment	 he	 broke	 into	 that	 day	 belonged	 to	 two 	 young
women,	twenty-one-year-old	Janice	Wylie,	a	researche r	at	Newsweek
magazine,	 and	 twenty-three-year-old	 Emily	 Hoffert,	 a	 g rade-school
teacher.	Though	Robles	chose	the	apartment	on	New	Yo rk’s	swanky
Upper	 East	 Side	 to	 burglarize	 because	 he	 thought	 no 	 one	 would	 be
there,	Wylie	was	home.	Threatening	her	with	a	knife, 	Robles	tied	her
up.	As	he	was	leaving,	Hoffert	came	home.	To	make	good	 his	escape,
Robles	began	to	tie	her	up,	too.
As	Robles	tells	the	tale	years	later,	while	he	was	 tying	up	Hoffert,
Janice	Wylie	warned	him	he	would	not	get	away	with	t his	crime:	She
would	remember	his	face	and	help	the	police	track	him	 down.	Robles,
who	 had	 promised	 himself	 this	 was	 to	 have	 been	 his	 la st	 burglary,
panicked	at	that,	completely	losing	control.	In	a	fr enzy,	he	grabbed	a
soda	 bottle	 and	 clubbed	 the	 women	 until	 they	 were	 un conscious,
then,	awash	in	rage	and	fear,	he	slashed	and	stabbe d	them	over	and
over	with	a	kitchen	knife.	Looking	back	on	that	momen t	some	twenty-
five	years	later,	Robles	lamented,	“I	just	went	bana nas.	My	head	just
exploded.”
To	this	day	Robles	has	lots	of	time	to	regret	those	 few	minutes	of
rage	 unleashed.	 At	 this	 writing	 he	 is	 still	 in	 pris on,	 some	 three
decades	later,	for	what	became	known	as	the	“Career	Girl	Murde rs.”
======================================== [Página 34] ========================================

Such	emotional	explosions	are	neural	hijackings.	At	 those	moments,
evidence	 suggests,	 a	 center	 in	 the	 limbic	 brain	 proc laims	 an
emergency,	recruiting	the	rest	of	the	brain	to	its	u rgent	agenda.	The
hijacking	 occurs	 in	 an	 instant,	 triggering	 this	 rea ction	 crucial
moments	before	the	neocortex,	the	thinking	brain,	has 	had	a	chance
to	 glimpse	 fully	 what	 is	 happening,	 let	 alone	 decide 	 if	 it	 is	 a	 good
idea.	The	hallmark	of	such	a	hijack	is	that	once	the 	moment	passes,
those	 so	 possessed	 have	 the	 sense	 of	 not	 knowing	 wh at	 came	 over
them.
These	hijacks	are	by	no	means	isolated,	horrific	inc idents	that	lead
to	brutal	crimes	like	the	Career	Girl	Murders.	In	le ss	catastrophic	form
—but	 not	 necessarily	 less	 intense—they	 happen	 to	 us	 w ith	 fair
frequency.	 Think	 back	 to	 the	 last	 time	 you	 “lost	 it, ”	 blowing	 up	 at
someone—your	spouse	or	child,	or	perhaps	the	driver	of	another 	car—
to	 a	 degree	 that	 later,	 with	 some	 reflection	 and	 hin dsight,	 seemed
uncalled	 for.	 In	 all	 probability,	 that,	 too,	 was	 su ch	 a	 hijacking,	 a
neural	takeover	which,	as	we	shall	see,	originates	 in	the	amygdala,	a
center	in	the	limbic	brain.
Not	 all	 limbic	 hijackings	 are	 distressing.	 When	 a	 jo ke	 strikes
someone	as	so	uproarious	that	their	laughter	is	almos t	explosive,	that,
too,	is	a	limbic	response.	It	is	at	work	also	in	momen ts	of	intense	joy:
When	Dan	Jansen,	after	several	heartbreaking	failur es	to	capture	an
Olympic	Gold	Medal	for	speed	skating	(which	he	had	v owed	to	do	for
his	dying	sister),	finally	won	the	Gold	in	the	1,00 0-meter	race	in	the
1994	Winter	Olympics	in	Norway,	his	wife	was	so	over come	by	the
excitement	 and	 happiness	 that	 she	 had	 to	 be	 rushed	 t o	 emergency
physicians	at	rinkside.
THE	SEAT	OF	ALL	PASSION
In	 humans	 the	 amygdala	 (from	 the	 Greek	 word	 for	 “almond ”)	 is	 an
almond-shaped	cluster	of	interconnected	structures	p erched	above	the
brainstem,	 near	 the	 bottom	 of	 the	 limbic	 ring.	 There	 a re	 two
amygdalas,	one	on	each	side	of	the	brain,	nestled	to ward	the	side	of
the	head.	The	human	amygdala	is	relatively	large	compa red	to	that	in
any	of	our	closest	evolutionary	cousins,	the	primates.
The	hippocampus	and	the	amygdala	were	the	two	key	par ts	of	the
primitive	“nose	brain”	that,	in	evolution,	gave	rise 	to	the	cortex	and
then	 the	 neocortex.	 To	 this	 day	 these	 limbic	 structu res	 do	 much	 or
======================================== [Página 35] ========================================

most	 of	 the	 brain’s	 learning	 and	 remembering;	 the	 amygd ala	 is	 the
specialist	for	emotional	matters.	If	the	amygdala	is	s evered	from	the
rest	 of	 the	 brain,	 the	 result	 is	 a	 striking	 inabili ty	 to	 gauge	 the
emotional	 significance	 of	 events;	 this	 condition	 is	 sometimes	 called
“affective	blindness.”
Lacking	 emotional	 weight,	 encounters	 lose	 their	 hold .	 One	 young
man	whose	amygdala	had	been	surgically	removed	to	cont rol	severe
seizures	became	completely	uninterested	in	people,	pr eferring	to	sit	in
isolation	with	no	human	contact.	While	he	was	perfec tly	capable	of
conversation,	he	no	longer	recognized	close	friends ,	relatives,	or	even
his	mother,	and	remained	impassive	in	the	face	of	thei r	anguish	at	his
indifference.	 Without	 an	 amygdala	 he	 seemed	 to	 have	 l ost	 all
recognition	 of	 feeling,	 as	 well	 as	 any	 feeling	 abou t	 feelings. 1	 The
amygdala	 acts	 as	 a	 storehouse	 of	 emotional	 memory,	 and	 thus	 of
significance	 itself;	 life	 without	 the	 amygdala	 is	 a	 life	 stripped	 of
personal	meanings.
More	than	affection	is	tied	to	the	amygdala;	all	pas sion	depends	on
it.	Animals	that	have	their	amygdala	removed	or	severe d	lack	fear	and
rage,	lose	the	urge	to	compete	or	cooperate,	and	no	 longer	have	any
sense	of	their	place	in	their	kind’s	social	order;	 emotion	is	blunted	or
absent.	Tears,	an	emotional	signal	unique	to	humans,	 are	triggered	by
the	amygdala	and	a	nearby	structure,	the	cingulate	g yrus;	being	held,
stroked,	 or	 otherwise	 comforted	 soothes	 these	 same	 br ain	 regions,
stopping	the	sobs.	Without	an	amygdala,	there	are	no 	tears	of	sorrow
to	soothe.
Joseph	LeDoux,	a	neuroscientist	at	the	Center	for	N eural	Science	at
New	 York	 University,	 was	 the	 first	 to	 discover	 the	 key	 role	 of	 the
amygdala	in	the	emotional	brain. 2	LeDoux	is	part	of	a	fresh	breed	of
neuroscientists	 who	 draw	 on	 innovative	 methods	 and	 t echnologies
that	 bring	 a	 previously	 unknown	 level	 of	 precision	 to	 mapping	 the
brain	 at	 work,	 and	 so	 can	 lay	 bare	 mysteries	 of	 mind	 that	 earlier
generations	of	scientists	have	found	impenetrable.	Hi s	findings	on	the
circuitry	 of	 the	 emotional	 brain	 overthrow	 a	 long-st anding	 notion
about	 the	 limbic	 system,	 putting	 the	 amygdala	 at	 the	 c enter	 of	 the
action	and	placing	other	limbic	structures	in	very	different 	roles. 3
LeDoux’s	research	explains	how	the	amygdala	can	take 	control	over
what	we	do	even	as	the	thinking	brain,	the	neocorte x,	is	still	coming
to	a	decision.
As	we	shall	see,	the	workings	of	the	amygdala	and	it s	interplay	with
the	neocortex	are	at	the	heart	of	emotional	intelligence.

THE	NEURAL	TRIPWIRE
Most	 intriguing	 for	 understanding	 the	 power	 of	 emoti ons	 in	 mental
life	 are	 those	 moments	 of	 impassioned	 action	 that	 we	 l ater	 regret,
once	the	dust	has	settled;	the	question	is	how	we	s o	easily	become	so
irrational.	Take,	for	example,	a	young	woman	who	drov e	two	hours	to
Boston	to	have	brunch	and	spend	the	day	with	her	bo yfriend.	During
brunch	he	gave	her	a	present	she’d	been	wanting	for 	months,	a	hard-
to-find	 art	 print	 brought	 back	 from	 Spain.	 But	 her	 d elight	 dissolved
the	moment	she	suggested	that	after	brunch	they	go	to 	a	matinee	of	a
movie	she’d	been	wanting	to	see	and	her	friend	stunn ed	her	by	saying
he	couldn’t	spend	the	day	with	her	because	he	had	s oftball	practice.
Hurt	 and	 incredulous,	 she	 got	 up	 in	 tears,	 left	 the	 cafe,	 and,	 on
impulse,	 threw	 the	 print	 in	 a	 garbage	 can.	 Months	 la ter,	 recounting
the	incident,	it’s	not	walking	out	she	regrets,	but	the	loss	o f	the	print.
It	 is	 in	 moments	 such	 as	 these—when	 impulsive	 feeling	 o verrides
the	 rational—that	 the	 newly	 discovered	 role	 for	 the	 amygdala	 is
pivotal.	Incoming	signals	from	the	senses	let	the	amyg dala	scan	every
experience	for	trouble.	This	puts	the	amygdala	in	a	 powerful	post	in
mental	life,	something	like	a	psychological	sentinel, 	challenging	every
situation,	every	perception,	with	but	one	kind	of	q uestion	in	mind,	the
most	primitive:	“Is	this	something	I	hate?	That	hurts	 me?	Something	I
fear?”	 If	 so—if	 the	 moment	 at	 hand	 somehow	 draws	 a	 “Yes ”—the
amygdala	reacts	instantaneously,	like	a	neural	tripw ire,	telegraphing	a
message	of	crisis	to	all	parts	of	the	brain.
In	the	brain’s	architecture,	the	amygdala	is	poised	something 	like	an
alarm	company	where	operators	stand	ready	to	send	out 	emergency
calls	to	the	fire	department,	police,	and	a	neighbor 	whenever	a	home
security	system	signals	trouble.
When	it	sounds	an	alarm	of,	say,	fear,	it	sends	urge nt	messages	to
every	major	part	of	the	brain:	it	triggers	the	secre tion	of	the	body’s
fight-or-flight	 hormones,	 mobilizes	 the	 centers	 for	 mo vement,	 and
activates	the	cardiovascular	system,	the	muscles,	and 	the	gut. 4	Other
circuits	from	the	amygdala	signal	the	secretion	of	eme rgency	dollops
of	the	hormone	norepinephrine	to	heighten	the	reacti vity	of	key	brain
areas,	 including	 those	 that	 make	 the	 senses	 more	 aler t,	 in	 effect
setting	the	brain	on	edge.	Additional	signals	from	t he	amygdala	tell
the	brainstem	to	fix	the	face	in	a	fearful	expressio n,	freeze	unrelated
movements	 the	 muscles	 had	 underway,	 speed	 heart	 rate	 a nd	 raise
blood	pressure,	slow	breathing.	Others	rivet	attent ion	on	the	source	of
======================================== [Página 37] ========================================

the	 fear,	 and	 prepare	 the	 muscles	 to	 react	 according ly.
Simultaneously,	cortical	memory	systems	are	shuffled	to 	retrieve	any
knowledge	relevant	to	the	emergency	at	hand,	taking	 precedence	over
other	strands	of	thought.
And	these	are	just	part	of	a	carefully	coordinated	 array	of	changes
the	 amygdala	 orchestrates	 as	 it	 commandeers	 areas	 thro ughout	 the
brain	(for	a	more	detailed	account,	see	 Appendix	C ).	The	amygdala’s
extensive	 web	 of	 neural	 connections	 allows	 it,	 duri ng	 an	 emotional
emergency,	 to	 capture	 and	 drive	 much	 of	 the	 rest	 of	 t he	 brain—
including	the	rational	mind.
THE	EMOTIONAL	SENTINEL
A	 friend	 tells	 of	 having	 been	 on	 vacation	 in	 Englan d,	 and	 eating
brunch	at	a	canalside	cafe.	Taking	a	stroll	afterwa rd	along	the	stone
steps	down	to	the	canal,	he	suddenly	saw	a	girl	gaz ing	at	the	water,
her	face	frozen	in	fear.	Before	he	knew	quite	why,	 he	had	jumped	in
the	water—in	his	coat	and	tie.	Only	once	he	was	in	t he	water	did	he
realize	that	the	girl	was	staring	in	shock	at	a	tod dler	who	had	fallen	in
—whom	he	was	able	to	rescue.
What	 made	 him	 jump	 in	 the	 water	 before	 he	 knew	 why?	 Th e
answer,	very	likely,	was	his	amygdala.
In	 one	 of	 the	 most	 telling	 discoveries	 about	 emotions 	 of	 the	 last
decade,	 LeDoux’s	 work	 revealed	 how	 the	 architecture 	 of	 the	 brain
gives	 the	 amygdala	 a	 privileged	 position	 as	 an	 emotio nal	 sentinel,
able	to	hijack	the	brain. 5	His	research	has	shown	that	sensory	signals
from	eye	or	ear	travel	first	in	the	brain	to	the	tha lamus,	and	then—
across	 a	 single	 synapse—to	 the	 amygdala;	 a	 second	 sig nal	 from	 the
thalamus	 is	 routed	 to	 the	 neocortex—the	 thinking	 brai n.	 This
branching	 allows	 the	 amygdala	 to	 begin	 to	 respond	 before 	 the
neocortex,	 which	 mulls	 information	 through	 several	 le vels	 of	 brain
circuits	 before	 it	 fully	 perceives	 and	 finally	 init iates	 its	 more	 finely
tailored	response.
LeDoux’s	research	is	revolutionary	for	understandin g	emotional	life
because	 it	 is	 the	 first	 to	 work	 out	 neural	 pathways 	 for	 feelings	 that
bypass	the	neocortex.	Those	feelings	that	take	the	direct	ro ute	through
the	amygdala	include	our	most	primitive	and	potent;	th is	circuit	does
much	to	explain	the	power	of	emotion	to	overwhelm	rationality.
The	conventional	view	in	neuroscience	had	been	that 	the	eye,	ear,
======================================== [Página 38] ========================================

and	other	sensory	organs	transmit	signals	to	the	tha lamus,	and	from
there	to	sensory	processing	areas	of	the	neocortex, 	where	the	signals
are	 put	 together	 into	 objects	 as	 we	 perceive	 them.	 T he	 signals	 are
sorted	for	meanings	so	that	the	brain	recognizes	wha t	each	object	is
and	what	its	presence	means.	From	the	neocortex,	the	 old	theory	held,
the	signals	are	sent	to	the	limbic	brain,	and	from	there	the	appr opriate
response	radiates	out	through	the	brain	and	the	res t	of	the	body.	That
is	the	way	it	works	much	or	most	of	the	time—but	LeDoux 	discovered
a	smaller	bundle	of	neurons	that	leads	directly	from	 the	thalamus	to
the	amygdala,	in	addition	to	those	going	through	the 	larger	path	of
neurons	to	the	cortex.	This	smaller	and	shorter	path way—something
like	a	neural	back	alley—allows	the	amygdala	to	recei ve	some	direct
inputs	 from	 the	 senses	 and	 start	 a	 response	 before 	 they	 are	 fully
registered	by	the	neocortex.
This	 discovery	 overthrows	 the	 notion	 that	 the	 amygda la	 must
depend	 entirely	 on	 signals	 from	 the	 neocortex	 to	 for mulate	 its
emotional	reactions.	The	amygdala	can	trigger	an	emoti onal	response
via	 this	 emergency	 route	 even	 as	 a	 parallel	 reverber ating	 circuit
begins	between	the	amygdala	and	neocortex.	The	amygda la	can	have
us	spring	to	action	while	the	slightly	slower—but	mor e	fully	informed
—neocortex	unfolds	its	more	refined	plan	for	reaction.
LeDoux	 overturned	 the	 prevailing	 wisdom	 about	 the	 pa thways
traveled	 by	 emotions	 through	 his	 research	 on	 fear	 in 	 animals.	 In	 a
crucial	 experiment	 he	 destroyed	 the	 auditory	 cortex	 of	 rats,	 then
exposed	them	to	a	tone	paired	with	an	electric	shock .	The	rats	quickly
learned	to	fear	the	tone,	even	though	the	sound	of	 the	tone	could	not
register	 in	 their	 neocortex.	 Instead,	 the	 sound	 too k	 the	 direct	 route
from	 ear	 to	 thalamus	 to	 amygdala,	 skipping	 all	 higher 	 avenues.	 In
short,	the	rats	had	learned	an	emotional	reaction	wi thout	any	higher
cortical	 involvement:	 The	 amygdala	 perceived,	 remembere d,	 and
orchestrated	their	fear	independently.
“Anatomically	 the	 emotional	 system	 can	 act	 independent ly	 of	 the
neocortex,”	 LeDoux	 told	 me.	 “Some	 emotional	 reactions	 and
emotional	memories	can	be	formed	without	any	conscious, 	cognitive
participation	at	all.”	The	amygdala	can	house	memories 	and	response
repertoires	 that	 we	 enact	 without	 quite	 realizing	 w hy	 we	 do	 so
because	the	shortcut	from	thalamus	to	amygdala	complete ly	bypasses
the	 neocortex.	 This	 bypass	 seems	 to	 allow	 the	 amygdal a	 to	 be	 a
repository	 for	 emotional	 impressions	 and	 memories	 that	 we	 have
never	known	about	in	full	awareness.	LeDoux	propose s	that	it	is	the
======================================== [Página 39] ========================================

amygdala’s	subterranean	role	in	memory	that	explains,	 for	example,	a
startling	experiment	in	which	people	acquired	a	pref erence	for	oddly
shaped	 geometric	 figures	 that	 had	 been	 flashed	 at	 th em	 so	 quickly
that	they	had	no	conscious	awareness	of	having	seen	them	at	all !6
A	visual	signal	first	goes	from	the	retina	to	the	t halamus,	where	it	is	translated	into	the	language	o f
the	brain.	Most	of	the	message	then	goes	to	the	vis ual	cortex,	where	it	is	analyzed	and	assessed	for
meaning	and	appropriate	response;	if	that	response	i s	emotional,	a	signal	goes	to	the	amygdala	to
activate	the	emotional	centers.	But	a	smaller	portio n	of	the	original	signal	goes	straight	from	the
thalamus	to	the	amygdala	in	a	quicker	transmission,	a llowing	a	faster	(though	less	precise)
response.	Thus	the	amygdala	can	trigger	an	emotiona l	response	before	the	cortical	centers	have	fully
understood	what	is	happening .
Other	research	has	shown	that	in	the	first	few	milli seconds	of	our
perceiving	something	we	not	only	unconsciously	compre hend	what	it
is,	but	decide	whether	we	like	it	or	not;	the	“cogn itive	unconscious”
presents	our	awareness	with	not	just	the	identity	o f	what	we	see,	but
an	 opinion	 about	 it. 7	 Our	 emotions	 have	 a	 mind	 of	 their	 own,	 one
which	can	hold	views	quite	independently	of	our	rational	mind .
======================================== [Página 40] ========================================

THE	SPECIALIST	IN	EMOTIONAL	MEMORY
Those	unconscious	opinions	are	emotional	memories;	the ir	storehouse
is	the	amygdala.	Research	by	LeDoux	and	other	neuros cientists	now
seems	 to	 suggest	 that	 the	 hippocampus,	 which	 has	 long 	 been
considered	the	key	structure	of	the	limbic	system,	is 	more	involved	in
registering	 and	 making	 sense	 of	 perceptual	 patterns	 than	 with
emotional	reactions.	The	hippocampus’s	main	input	is	i n	providing	a
keen	 memory	 of	 context,	 vital	 for	 emotional	 meaning;	 it 	 is	 the
hippocampus	that	recognizes	the	differing	significan ce	of,	say,	a	bear
in	the	zoo	versus	one	in	your	backyard.
While	 the	 hippocampus	 remembers	 the	 dry	 facts,	 the	 amyg dala
retains	 the	 emotional	 flavor	 that	 goes	 with	 those	 fa cts.	 If	 we	 try	 to
pass	a	car	on	a	two-lane	highway	and	narrowly	miss	h aving	a	head-on
collision,	 the	 hippocampus	 retains	 the	 specifics	 of	 the	 incident,	 like
what	stretch	of	road	we	were	on,	who	was	with	us,	w hat	the	other	car
looked	like.	But	it	is	the	amygdala	that	everafter	w ill	send	a	surge	of
anxiety	 through	 us	 whenever	 we	 try	 to	 pass	 a	 car	 in 	 similar
circumstances.	As	LeDoux	put	it	to	me,	“The	hippocampus	is	cruci al	in
recognizing	a	face	as	that	of	your	cousin.	But	it	i s	the	amygdala	that
adds	you	don’t	really	like	her.”
The	 brain	 uses	 a	 simple	 but	 cunning	 method	 to	 make	 emot ional
memories	register	with	special	potency:	the	very	same	 neurochemical
alerting	 systems	 that	 prime	 the	 body	 to	 react	 to	 life -threatening
emergencies	by	fighting	or	fleeing	also	stamp	the	momen t	in	memory
with	 vividness. 8	 Under	 stress	 (or	 anxiety,	 or	 presumably	 even	 the
intense	 excitement	 of	 joy)	 a	 nerve	 running	 from	 the	 b rain	 to	 the
adrenal	glands	atop	the	kidneys	triggers	a	secretio n	of	the	hormones
epinephrine	 and	 norepinephrine,	 which	 surge	 through 	 the	 body
priming	 it	 for	 an	 emergency.	 These	 hormones	 activate	 r eceptors	 on
the	 vagus	 nerve;	 while	 the	 vagus	 nerve	 carries	 messa ges	 from	 the
brain	to	regulate	the	heart,	it	also	carries	signal s	back	into	the	brain,
triggered	 by	 epinephrine	 and	 norepinephrine.	 The	 amy gdala	 is	 the
main	site	in	the	brain	where	these	signals	go;	they	 activate	neurons
within	 the	 amygdala	 to	 signal	 other	 brain	 regions	 to 	 strengthen
memory	for	what	is	happening.
This	amygdala	arousal	seems	to	imprint	in	memory	most	momen ts
of	emotional	arousal	with	an	added	degree	of	strengt h—that’s	why	we
are	more	likely,	for	example,	to	remember	where	we	went 	on	a	first
date,	or	what	we	were	doing	when	we	heard	the	news	 that	the	space

shuttle	Challenger 	 had	 exploded.	 The	 more	 intense	 the	 amygdala
arousal,	the	stronger	the	imprint;	the	experiences	t hat	scare	or	thrill
us	 the	 most	 in	 life	 are	 among	 our	 most	 indelible	 memorie s.	 This
means	 that,	 in	 effect,	 the	 brain	 has	 two	 memory	 systems ,	 one	 for
ordinary	facts	and	one	for	emotionally	charged	ones. 	A	special	system
for	emotional	memories	makes	excellent	sense	in	evoluti on,	of	course,
ensuring	that	animals	would	have	particularly	vivid	 memories	of	what
threatens	 or	 pleases	 them.	 But	 emotional	 memories	 can	 b e	 faulty
guides	to	the	present.
OUT-OF-DATE	NEURAL	ALARMS
One	drawback	of	 such	neural	alarms	 is	that	the	 urgen t	message	the
amygdala	sends	is	sometimes,	if	not	often,	out-of-date —especially	in
the	 fluid	 social	 world	 we	 humans	 inhabit.	 As	 the	 rep ository	 for
emotional	memory,	the	amygdala	scans	experience,	compari ng	what
is	 happening	 now	 with	 what	 happened	 in	 the	 past.	 It s	 method	 of
comparison	 is	 associative:	 when	 one	 key	 element	 of	 a	 present
situation	is	similar	to	the	past,	it	can	call	it	a	“ match”—which	is	why
this	 circuit	 is	 sloppy:	 it	 acts	 before	 there	 is	 ful l	 confirmation.	 It
frantically	commands	that	we	react	to	the	present	in	 ways	that	were
imprinted	 long	 ago,	 with	 thoughts,	 emotions,	 reaction s	 learned	 in
response	 to	 events	 perhaps	 only	 dimly	 similar,	 but	 cl ose	 enough	 to
alarm	the	amygdala.
Thus	 a	 former	 army	 nurse,	 traumatized	 by	 the	 relentles s	 flood	 of
ghastly	wounds	she	once	tended	in	wartime,	is	sudden ly	swept	with	a
mix	of	dread,	loathing,	and	panic—a	repeat	of	her	bat tlefield	reaction
triggered	 once	 again,	 years	 later,	 by	 the	 stench	 wh en	 she	 opens	 a
closet	door	to	find	her	toddler	had	stashed	a	stink ing	diaper	there.	A
few	 spare	 elements	 of	 the	 situation	 is	 all	 that	 need 	 seem	 similar	 to
some	 past	 danger	 for	 the	 amygdala	 to	 trigger	 its	 emerg ency
proclamation.	The	trouble	is	that	along	with	the	emot ionally	charged
memories	that	have	the	power	to	trigger	this	crisis	r esponse	can	come
equally	outdated	ways	of	responding	to	it.
The	emotional	brain’s	imprecision	in	such	moments	is	ad ded	to	by
the	fact	that	many	potent	emotional	memories	date	from	t he	first	few
years	of	life,	in	the	relationship	between	an	infan t	and	its	caretakers.
This	is	especially	true	for	traumatic	events,	like	b eatings	or	outright
neglect.	 During	 this	 early	 period	 of	 life	 other	 bra in	 structures,
======================================== [Página 42] ========================================

particularly	 the	 hippocampus,	 which	 is	 crucial	 for	 n arrative
memories,	 and	 the	 neocortex,	 seat	 of	 rational	 thought ,	 have	 yet	 to
become	fully	developed.	In	memory,	the	amygdala	and	hip pocampus
work	 hand-in-hand;	 each	 stores	 and	 retrieves	 its	 sp ecial	 information
independently.	 While	 the	 hippocampus	 retrieves	 infor mation,	 the
amygdala	determines	if	that	information	has	any	emotion al	valence.
But	the	amygdala,	which	matures	very	quickly	in	the	i nfant’s	brain,	is
much	closer	to	fully	formed	at	birth.
LeDoux	turns	to	the	role	of	the	amygdala	in	childhoo d	to	support
what	has	long	been	a	basic	tenet	of	psychoanalytic	 thought:	that	the
interactions	of	life’s	earliest	years	lay	down	a	se t	of	emotional	lessons
based	 on	 the	 attunement	 and	 upsets	 in	 the	 contacts	 b etween	 infant
and	 caretakers. 9	 These	 emotional	 lessons	 are	 so	 potent	 and	 yet	 so
difficult	 to	 understand	 from	 the	 vantage	 point	 of	 ad ult	 life	 because,
believes	LeDoux,	they	are	stored	in	the	amygdala	as	 rough,	wordless
blueprints	for	emotional	life.	Since	these	earliest	 emotional	memories
are	 established	 at	 a	 time	 before	 infants	 have	 words	 for	 their
experience,	when	these	emotional	memories	are	triggere d	in	later	life
there	 is	 no	 matching	 set	 of	 articulated	 thoughts	 abo ut	 the	 response
that	takes	us	over.	One	reason	we	can	be	so	baffled 	by	our	emotional
outbursts,	then,	is	that	they	often	date	from	a	time	 early	in	our	lives
when	 things	 were	 bewildering	 and	 we	 did	 not	 yet	 hav e	 words	 for
comprehending	events.	We	may	have	the	chaotic	feeling s,	but	not	the
words	for	the	memories	that	formed	them.
WHEN	EMOTIONS	ARE	FAST	AND	SLOPPY
It	was	somewhere	 around	three	in	 the	morning	when	 a	h uge	object
came	 crashing	 through	 the	 ceiling	 in	 a	 far	 corner	 of 	 my	 bedroom,
spilling	the	contents	of	the	attic	into	the	room.	In 	a	second	I	leapt	out
of	bed	and	ran	out	of	the	room,	terrified	the	entire 	ceiling	would	cave
in.	Then,	realizing	I	was	safe,	I	cautiously	peered 	back	in	the	bedroom
to	 see	 what	 had	 caused	 all	 the	 damage—only	 to	 discove r	 that	 the
sound	I	had	taken	to	be	the	ceiling	caving	in	was	a ctually	the	fall	of	a
tall	 pile	 of	 boxes	 my	 wife	 had	 stacked	 in	 the	 corner 	 the	 day	 before
while	 she	 sorted	 out	 her	 closet.	 Nothing	 had	 fallen 	 from	 the	 attic:
there	was	no	attic.	The	ceiling	was	intact,	and	so	was	I.
My	 leap	 from	 bed	 while	 half-asleep—which	 might	 have	 sa ved	 me
from	injury	had	it	truly	been	the	ceiling	falling—ill ustrates	the	power
======================================== [Página 43] ========================================

of	the	amygdala	to	propel	us	to	action	in	emergencies ,	vital	moments
before	the	neocortex	has	time	to	fully	register	what 	is	actually	going
on.	The	emergency	route	from	eye	or	ear	to	thalamus	to 	amygdala	is
crucial:	 it	 saves	 time	 in	 an	 emergency,	 when	 an	 insta ntaneous
response	 is	 required.	 But	 this	 circuit	 from	 thalamus	 to	 amygdala
carries	 only	 a	 small	 portion	 of	 sensory	 messages,	 wit h	 the	 majority
taking	 the	 main	 route	 up	 to	 the	 neocortex.	 So	 what	 r egisters	 in	 the
amygdala	via	this	express	route	is,	at	best,	a	rough 	signal,	just	enough
for	a	warning.	As	LeDoux	points	out,	“You	don’t	nee d	to	know	exactly
what	something	is	to	know	that	it	may	be	dangerous.” 10
The	 direct	 route	 has	 a	 vast	 advantage	 in	 brain	 time, 	 which	 is
reckoned	in	thousandths	of	a	second.	The	amygdala	in 	a	rat	can	begin
a	response	to	a	perception	in	as	little	as	twelve	mi lliseconds—twelve
thousandths	 of	 a	 second.	 The	 route	 from	 thalamus	 to	 n eocortex	 to
amygdala	takes	about	twice	as	long.	Similar	measurement s	have	yet
to	be	made	in	the	human	brain,	but	the	rough	ratio	would	likely	ho ld.
In	evolutionary	terms,	the	survival	value	of	this	di rect	route	would
have	been	great,	allowing	a	quick-response	option	t hat	shaves	a	few
critical	 milliseconds	 in	 reaction	 time	 to	 dangers.	 Th ose	 milliseconds
could	well	have	saved	the	lives	of	our	protomammalian	 ancestors	in
such	 numbers	 that	 this	 arrangement	 is	 now	 featured	 in 	 every
mammalian	brain,	including	yours	and	mine.	In	fact,	whi le	this	circuit
may	 play	 a	 relatively	 limited	 role	 in	 human	 mental	 life ,	 largely
restricted	to	emotional	crises,	much	of	the	mental	lif e	of	birds,	fish,
and	reptiles	revolves	around	it,	since	their	very	s urvival	depends	on
constantly	 scanning	 for	 predators	 or	 prey.	 “This	 pr imitive,	 minor
brain	system	in	mammals	is	the	main	brain	system	in	non-ma mmals,”
says	LeDoux.	“It	offers	a	very	rapid	way	to	turn	on 	emotions.	But	it’s	a
quick-and-dirty	process;	the	cells	are	fast,	but	not	very	pr ecise.”
Such	imprecision	in,	say,	a	squirrel,	is	fine,	since 	it	leads	to	erring
on	the	side	of	safety,	springing	away	at	the	first	 sign	of	anything	that
might	 signal	 a	 looming	 enemy,	 or	 springing	 toward	 a	 hi nt	 of
something	 edible.	 But	 in	 human	 emotional	 life	 that	 impr ecision	 can
have	 disastrous	 consequences	 for	 our	 relationships, 	 since	 it	 means,
figuratively	speaking,	we	can	spring	at	or	away	fro m	the	wrong	thing
—or	person.	(Consider,	for	example,	the	waitress	who	 dropped	a	tray
of	six	dinners	when	she	glimpsed	a	woman	with	a	huge, 	curly	mane	of
red	hair—exactly	like	the	woman	her	ex-husband	had	left	her	for .)
Such	 inchoate	 emotional	 mistakes	 are	 based	 on	 feeling 	 prior	 to
thought.	LeDoux	calls	it	“precognitive	emotion,”	a	r eaction	based	on
======================================== [Página 44] ========================================

neural	bits	and	pieces	of	sensory	information	that	h ave	not	been	fully
sorted	out	and	integrated	into	a	recognizable	objec t.	It’s	a	very	raw
form	of	sensory	information,	something	like	a	neural	 Name	That	Tune ,
where,	instead	of	snap	judgments	of	melody	being	made	 on	the	basis
of	just	a	few	notes,	a	whole	perception	is	grasped	 on	the	basis	of	the
first	few	tentative	parts.	If	the	amygdala	senses	a	 sensory	pattern	of
import	 emerging,	 it	 jumps	 to	 a	 conclusion,	 triggering	 its	 reactions
before	there	is	full	confirming	evidence—or	any	confirmation	a t	all.
Small	 wonder	 we	 can	 have	 so	 little	 insight	 into	 the	 murk	 of	 our
more	explosive	emotions,	especially	while	they	still	 hold	us	in	thrall.
The	amygdala	can	react	in	a	delirium	of	rage	or	fear	 before	the	cortex
knows	 what	 is	 going	 on	 because	 such	 raw	 emotion	 is	 t riggered
independent	of,	and	prior	to,	thought.
THE	EMOTIONAL	MANAGER
A	 friend’s	 six-year-old	 daughter	 Jessica	 was	 spendi ng	 her	 first	 night
ever	sleeping	over	at	a	playmate’s,	and	it	was	uncle ar	who	was	more
nervous	about	it,	mother	or	daughter.	While	the	mothe r	tried	not	to
let	 Jessica	 see	 the	 intense	 anxiety	 she	 felt,	 her	 t ension	 peaked	 near
midnight	that	night,	as	she	was	getting	ready	for	be d	and	heard	the
phone	 ring.	 Dropping	 her	 toothbrush,	 she	 raced	 to	 t he	 phone,	 her
heart	pounding,	images	of	Jessica	in	terrible	distre ss	racing	through
her	mind.
The	mother	snatched	the	receiver,	and	blurted,	“Jess ica!”	into	the
phone—only	to	hear	a	woman’s	voice	say,	“Oh,	I	think	 this	must	be	a
wrong	number.…”
At	 that,	 the	 mother	 recovered	 her	 composure,	 and	 in	 a 	 polite,
measured	tone,	asked,	“What	number	were	you	calling?”
While	 the	 amygdala	 is	 at	 work	 in	 priming	 an	 anxious,	 impulsive
reaction,	another	part	of	the	emotional	brain	allows 	for	a	more	fitting,
corrective	 response.	 The	 brain’s	 damper	 switch	 for	 t he	 amygdala’s
surges	 appears	 to	 lie	 at	 the	 other	 end	 of	 a	 major	 ci rcuit	 to	 the
neocortex,	 in	 the	 prefrontal	 lobes	 just	 behind	 the	 forehead.	 The
prefrontal	 cortex	 seems	 to	 be	 at	 work	 when	 someone	 is 	 fearful	 or
enraged,	 but	 stifles	 or	 controls	 the	 feeling	 in	 ord er	 to	 deal	 more
effectively	with	the	situation	at	hand,	or	when	a	r eappraisal	calls	for	a
completely	 different	 response,	 as	 with	 the	 worried	 mo ther	 on	 the
phone.	 This	 neocortical	 area	 of	 the	 brain	 brings	 a	 more	 analytic	 or
======================================== [Página 45] ========================================

appropriate	 response	 to	 our	 emotional	 impulses,	 modula ting	 the
amygdala	and	other	limbic	areas.
Ordinarily	the	prefrontal	areas	govern	our	emotional 	reactions	from
the	 start.	 The	 largest	 projection	 of	 sensory	 informa tion	 from	 the
thalamus,	remember,	goes	not	to	the	amygdala,	but	to	th e	neocortex
and	its	many	centers	for	taking	in	and	making	sense	o f	what	is	being
perceived;	that	information	and	our	response	to	it	i s	coordinated	by
the	 prefrontal	 lobes,	 the	 seat	 of	 planning	 and	 orga nizing	 actions
toward	a	goal,	including	emotional	ones.	In	the	neoc ortex	a	cascading
series	of	circuits	registers	and	analyzes	that	info rmation,	comprehends
it,	and,	through	the	prefrontal	lobes,	orchestrates 	a	reaction.	If	in	the
process	 an	 emotional	 response	 is	 called	 for,	 the	 pre frontal	 lobes
dictate	it,	working	hand-in-hand	with	the	amygdala	a nd	other	circuits
in	the	emotional	brain.
This	 progression,	 which	 allows	 for	 discernment	 in	 emo tional
response,	is	the	standard	arrangement,	with	the	sign ificant	exception
of	emotional	emergencies.	When	an	emotion	triggers,	wi thin	moments
the	prefrontal	lobes	perform	what	amounts	to	a	risk/b enefit	ratio	of
myriad	 possible	 reactions,	 and	 bet	 that	 one	 of	 them	 i s	 best. 11	 For
animals,	when	to	attack,	when	to	run.	And	for	we	huma ns	…	when	to
attack,	 when	 to	 run—and	 also,	 when	 to	 placate,	 persu ade,	 seek
sympathy,	 stonewall,	 provoke	 guilt,	 whine,	 put	 on	 a	 facade	 of
bravado,	be	contemptuous—and	so	on,	through	the	whole 	repertoire
of	emotional	wiles.
The	 neocortical	 response	 is	 slower	 in	 brain	 time	 tha n	 the	 hijack
mechanism	 because	 it	 involves	 more	 circuitry.	 It	 can	 a lso	 be	 more
judicious	and	considered,	since	more	thought	precede s	feeling.	When
we	register	a	loss	and	become	sad,	or	feel	happy	aft er	a	triumph,	or
mull	over	something	someone	has	said	or	done	and	then	 get	hurt	or
angry,	the	neocortex	is	at	work.
Just	 as	 with	 the	 amygdala,	 absent	 the	 workings	 of	 th e	 prefrontal
lobes,	 much	 of	 emotional	 life	 would	 fall	 away;	 lackin g	 an
understanding	 that	 something	 merits	 an	 emotional	 respo nse,	 none
comes.	 This	 role	 of	 the	 prefrontal	 lobes	 in	 emotions	 has	 been
suspected	by	neurologists	since	the	advent	in	the	1 940s	of	that	rather
desperate—and	 sadly	 misguided—surgical	 “cure”	 for	 menta l	 illness:
the	prefrontal	lobotomy,	which	(often	sloppily)	remov ed	part	of	the
prefrontal	lobes	or	otherwise	cut	connections	betwe en	the	prefrontal
cortex	 and	 the	 lower	 brain.	 In	 the	 days	 before	 any	 effective
medications	for	mental	illness,	the	lobotomy	was	haile d	as	the	answer
======================================== [Página 46] ========================================

to	 grave	 emotional	 distress—sever	 the	 links	 between	 t he	 prefrontal
lobes	and	the	rest	of	the	brain,	and	patients’	dist ress	was	“relieved.”
Unfortunately,	 the	 cost	 was	 that	 most	 of	 patients’	 e motional	 lives
seemed	to	vanish,	too.	The	key	circuitry	had	been	destroyed.
Emotional	hijackings	presumably	involve	two	dynamics:	 triggering
of	 the	 amygdala	 and	 a	 failure	 to	 activate	 the	 neocor tical	 processes
that	usually	keep	emotional	response	in	balance—or	a	 recruitment	of
the	neocortical	zones	to	the	emotional	urgency. 12	At	these	moments
the	 rational	 mind	 is	 swamped	 by	 the	 emotional.	 One	 way 	 the
prefrontal	cortex	acts	as	an	efficient	manager	of	emo tion—weighing
reactions	 before	 acting—is	 by	 dampening	 the	 signals	 f or	 activation
sent	out	by	the	amygdala	and	other	limbic	centers—somet hing	like	a
parent	who	stops	an	impulsive	child	from	grabbing	and 	tells	the	child
to	ask	properly	(or	wait)	for	what	it	wants	instead. 13
The	 key	 “off”	 switch	 for	 distressing	 emotion	 seems	 to 	 be	 the	 left
prefrontal	 lobe.	 Neuropsychologists	 studying	 moods	 i n	 patients	 with
injuries	to	parts	of	the	frontal	lobes	have	determin ed	that	one	of	the
tasks	of	the	left	frontal	lobe	is	to	act	as	a	neura l	thermostat,	regulating
unpleasant	emotions.	The	right	prefrontal	lobes	are	 a	seat	of	negative
feelings	like	fear	and	aggression,	while	the	left	l obes	keep	those	raw
emotions	 in	 check,	 probably	 by	 inhibiting	 the	 right	 lobe. 14	 In	 one
group	of	stroke	patients,	for	example,	those	whose	l esions	were	in	the
left	 prefrontal	 cortex	 were	 prone	 to	 catastrophic	 w orries	 and	 fears;
those	 with	 lesions	 on	 the	 right	 were	 “unduly	 cheerf ul”;	 during
neurological	 exams	 they	 joked	 around	 and	 were	 so	 lai d	 back	 they
clearly	did	not	care	how	well	they	did. 15	And	then	there	was	the	case
of	 the	 happy	 husband:	 a	 man	 whose	 right	 prefrontal	 l obe	 had	 been
partially	removed	in	surgery	for	a	brain	malformation. 	His	wife	told
physicians	 that	 after	 the	 operation	 he	 underwent	 a	 dramatic
personality	change,	becoming	less	easily	upset	and,	 she	was	happy	to
say,	more	affectionate. 16
The	left	prefrontal	lobe,	in	short,	seems	to	be	part 	of	a	neural	circuit
that	 can	 switch	 off,	 or	 at	 least	 dampen	 down,	 all	 bu t	 the	 strongest
negative	 surges	 of	 emotion.	 If	 the	 amygdala	 often	 act s	 as	 an
emergency	trigger,	the	left	prefrontal	lobe	appears	 to	be	part	of	the
brain’s	 “off”	 switch	 for	 disturbing	 emotion:	 the	 amyg dala	 proposes,
the	prefrontal	lobe	disposes.	These	prefrontal-limbi c	connections	are
crucial	 in	 mental	 life	 far	 beyond	 fine-tuning	 emotion ;	 they	 are
essential	for	navigating	us	through	the	decisions	t hat	matter	most	in
life.

HARMONIZING	EMOTION	AND	THOUGHT
The	connections	between	the	amygdala	(and	related	li mbic	structures)
and	 the	 neocortex	 are	 the	 hub	 of	 the	 battles	 or	 coo perative	 treaties
struck	 between	 head	 and	 heart,	 thought	 and	 feeling. 	 This	 circuitry
explains	 why	 emotion	 is	 so	 crucial	 to	 effective	 thou ght,	 both	 in
making	wise	decisions	and	in	simply	allowing	us	to	think	clearl y.
Take	 the	 power	 of	 emotions	 to	 disrupt	 thinking	 itsel f.
Neuroscientists	 use	 the	 term	 “working	 memory”	 for	 the	 capacity	 of
attention	that	holds	in	mind	the	facts	essential	for 	completing	a	given
task	or	problem,	whether	it	be	the	ideal	features	on e	seeks	in	a	house
while	 touring	 several	 prospects,	 or	 the	 elements	 of	 a	 reasoning
problem	 on	 a	 test.	 The	 prefrontal	 cortex	 is	 the	 brai n	 region
responsible	for	working	memory. 17	But	circuits	from	the	limbic	brain
to	 the	 prefrontal	 lobes	 mean	 that	 the	 signals	 of	 str ong	 emotion—
anxiety,	anger,	and	the	like—can	create	neural	stati c,	sabotaging	the
ability	 of	 the	 prefrontal	 lobe	 to	 maintain	 working	 me mory.	 That	 is
why	 when	 we	 are	 emotionally	 upset	 we	 say	 we	 “just	 ca n’t	 think
straight”—and	why	continual	emotional	distress	can	cr eate	deficits	in
a	child’s	intellectual	abilities,	crippling	the	capacity	t o	learn.
These	deficits,	if	more	subtle,	are	not	always	tappe d	by	IQ	testing,
though	 they	 show	 up	 through	 more	 targeted	 neuropsych ological
measures,	as	well	as	in	a	child’s	continual	agitatio n	and	impulsivity.
In	 one	 study,	 for	 example,	 primary	 school	 boys	 who	 ha d	 above-
average	IQ	scores	but	nevertheless	were	doing	poorl y	in	school	were
found	 via	 these	 neuropsychological	 tests	 to	 have	 imp aired	 frontal
cortex	 functioning. 18	 They	 also	 were	 impulsive	 and	 anxious,	 often
disruptive	 and	 in	 trouble—suggesting	 faulty	 prefront al	 control	 over
their	 limbic	 urges.	 Despite	 their	 intellectual	 poten tial,	 these	 are	 the
children	at	highest	risk	for	problems	like	academic	failure,	a lcoholism,
and	criminality—not	because	their	intellect	is	defici ent,	but	because
their	 control	 over	 their	 emotional	 life	 is	 impaired.	 The	 emotional
brain,	 quite	 separate	 from	 those	 cortical	 areas	 tapp ed	 by	 IQ	 tests,
controls	 rage	 and	 compassion	 alike.	 These	 emotional	 c ircuits	 are
sculpted	 by	 experience	 throughout	 childhood—and	 we	 l eave	 those
experiences	utterly	to	chance	at	our	peril.
Consider,	 too,	 the	 role	 of	 emotions	 in	 even	 the	 most	 “rational”
decision-making.	 In	 work	 with	 far-reaching	 implicatio ns	 for
understanding	mental	life,	Dr.	Antonio	Damasio,	a	neu rologist	at	the
University	 of	 Iowa	 College	 of	 Medicine,	 has	 made	 car eful	 studies	 of
======================================== [Página 48] ========================================

just	 what	 is	 impaired	 in	 patients	 with	 damage	 to	 the	 prefrontal-
amygdala	circuit. 19	Their	decision-making	is	terribly	flawed—and	yet
they	 show	 no	 deterioration	 at	 all	 in	 IQ	 or	 any	 cogn itive	 ability.
Despite	 their	 intact	 intelligence,	 they	 make	 disastr ous	 choices	 in
business	and	their	personal	lives,	and	can	even	obs ess	endlessly	over	a
decision	so	simple	as	when	to	make	an	appointment.
Dr.	 Damasio	 argues	 that	 their	 decisions	 are	 so	 bad	 b ecause	 they
have	 lost	 access	 to	 their	 emotional 	 learning.	 As	 the	 meeting	 point
between	 thought	 and	 emotion,	 the	 prefrontal-amygdala	 circuit	 is	 a
crucial	doorway	to	the	repository	for	the	likes	and 	dislikes	we	acquire
over	the	course	of	a	lifetime.	Cut	off	from	emotional	 memory	in	the
amygdala,	whatever	the	neocortex	mulls	over	no	longer 	triggers	the
emotional	 reactions	 that	 have	 been	 associated	 with	 i t	 in	 the	 past—
everything	takes	on	a	gray	neutrality.	A	stimulus,	b e	it	a	favorite	pet
or	 a	 detested	 acquaintance,	 no	 longer	 triggers	 eith er	 attraction	 or
aversion;	 these	 patients	 have	 “forgotten”	 all	 such	 emotional	 lessons
because	 they	 no	 longer	 have	 access	 to	 where	 they	 ar e	 stored	 in	 the
amygdala.
Evidence	 like	 this	 leads	 Dr.	 Damasio	 to	 the	 counter- intuitive
position	that	feelings	are	typically	 indispensable 	for	rational	decisions;
they	point	us	in	the	proper	direction,	where	dry	lo gic	can	then	be	of
best	use.	While	the	world	often	confronts	us	with	a n	unwieldy	array
of	 choices	 (How	 should	 you	 invest	 your	 retirement	 sav ings?	 Whom
should	 you	 marry?),	 the	 emotional	 learning	 that	 life	 has	 given	 us
(such	as	the	memory	of	a	disastrous	investment	or	a	pa inful	breakup)
sends	signals	that	streamline	the	decision	by	elimina ting	some	options
and	highlighting	others	at	the	outset.	In	this	way, 	Dr.	Damasio	argues,
the	 emotional	 brain	 is	 as	 involved	 in	 reasoning	 as	 i s	 the	 thinking
brain.
The	emotions,	then,	matter	for	rationality.	In	the	da nce	of	feeling
and	 thought	 the	 emotional	 faculty	 guides	 our	 moment-to -moment
decisions,	working	hand-in-hand	with	the	rational	mi nd,	enabling—or
disabling—thought	 itself.	 Likewise,	 the	 thinking	 bra in	 plays	 an
executive	 role	 in	 our	 emotions—except	 in	 those	 moments	 when
emotions	surge	out	of	control	and	the	emotional	brain	runs	rampa nt.
In	a	sense	we	have	two	brains,	two	minds—and	two	diff erent	kinds
of	 intelligence:	 rational	 and	 emotional.	 How	 we	 do	 in 	 life	 is
determined	by	both—it	is	not	just	IQ,	but	 emotional 	intelligence	that
matters.	 Indeed,	 intellect	 cannot	 work	 at	 its	 best	 w ithout	 emotional
intelligence.	 Ordinarily	 the	 complementarity	 of	 limbic 	 system	 and
======================================== [Página 49] ========================================

neocortex,	amygdala	and	prefrontal	lobes,	means	each	 is	a	full	partner
in	 mental	 life.	 When	 these	 partners	 interact	 well,	 e motional
intelligence	rises—as	does	intellectual	ability.
This	turns	the	old	understanding	of	the	tension	bet ween	reason	and
feeling	on	its	head:	it	is	not	that	we	want	to	do	a way	with	emotion
and	 put	 reason	 in	 its	 place,	 as	 Erasmus	 had	 it,	 but	 instead	 find	 the
intelligent	 balance	 of	 the	 two.	 The	 old	 paradigm	 hel d	 an	 ideal	 of
reason	 freed	 of	 the	 pull	 of	 emotion.	 The	 new	 paradig m	 urges	 us	 to
harmonize	 head	 and	 heart.	 To	 do	 that	 well	 in	 our	 liv es	 means	 we
must	 first	 understand	 more	 exactly	 what	 it	 means	 to	 us e	 emotion
intelligently.

When	Smart	Is	Dumb
Exactly	 why	 David	 Pologruto,	 a	 high-school	 physics	 teacher,	 was
stabbed	 with	 a	 kitchen	 knife	 by	 one	 of	 his	 star	 stu dents	 is	 still
debatable.	But	the	facts	as	widely	reported	are	these:
Jason	 H.,	 a	 sophomore	 and	 straight-A	 student	 at	 a	 Co ral	 Springs,
Florida,	high	school,	was	fixated	on	getting	into	me dical	school.	Not
just	 any	 medical	 school—he	 dreamt	 of	 Harvard.	 But	 Polog ruto,	 his
physics	teacher,	had	given	Jason	an	80	on	a	quiz.	B elieving	the	grade
—a	mere	B—put	his	dream	in	jeopardy,	Jason	took	a	butch er	knife	to
school	 and,	 in	 a	 confrontation	 with	 Pologruto	 in	 th e	 physics	 lab,
stabbed	 his	 teacher	 in	 the	 collarbone	 before	 being	 subdued	 in	 a
struggle.
A	 judge	 found	 Jason	 innocent,	 temporarily	 insane	 dur ing	 the
incident—a	panel	of	four	psychologists	and	psychiatr ists	swore	he	was
psychotic	 during	 the	 fight.	 Jason	 claimed	 he	 had	 bee n	 planning	 to
commit	suicide	because	of	the	test	score,	and	had	gone	to	Pologr uto	to
tell	 him	 he	 was	 killing	 himself	 because	 of	 the	 bad	 gr ade.	 Pologruto
told	a	different	story:	“I	think	he	tried	to	completely	do	me	in	w ith	the
knife”	because	he	was	infuriated	over	the	bad	grade.
After	 transferring	 to	 a	 private	 school,	 Jason	 gradu ated	 two	 years
later	at	the	top	of	his	class.	A	perfect	grade	in	r egular	classes	would
have	given	him	a	straight-A,	4.0	average,	but	Jason	 had	taken	enough
advanced	 courses	 to	 raise	 his	 grade-point	 average	 t o	 4.614—way
beyond	 A+.	 Even	 as	 Jason	 graduated	 with	 highest	 hono rs,	 his	 old
physics	 teacher,	 David	 Pologruto,	 complained	 that	 Ja son	 had	 never
apologized	or	even	taken	responsibility	for	the	attack. 1
The	question	is,	how	could	someone	of	such	obvious	i ntelligence	do
something	so	irrational—so	downright	dumb?	The	answer: 	Academic
intelligence	has	little	to	do	with	emotional	life.	T he	brightest	among
us	 can	 founder	 on	 the	 shoals	 of	 unbridled	 passions	 and	 unruly
impulses;	people	with	high	IQs	can	be	stunningly	poo r	pilots	of	their
private	lives.
One	of	psychology’s	open	secrets	is	the	relative	in ability	of	grades,
======================================== [Página 52] ========================================

IQ,	 or	 SAT	 scores,	 despite	 their	 popular	 mystique,	 t o	 predict
unerringly	who	will	succeed	in	life.	To	be	sure,	th ere	is	a	relationship
between	IQ	and	life	circumstances	for	large	groups	a s	a	whole:	many
people	with	very	low	IQs	end	up	in	menial	jobs,	and	 those	with	high
IQs	tend	to	become	well-paid—but	by	no	means	always.
There	 are	 widespread	 exceptions	 to	 the	 myth	 that	 IQ	 predicts
success—many	 (or	 more)	 exceptions	 than	 cases	 that	 fit	 the	 rule.	 At
best,	IQ	contributes	about	20	percent	to	the	factor s	that	determine	life
success,	 which	 leaves	 80	 percent	 to	 other	 forces. 2	 As	 one	 observer
notes,	 “The	 vast	 majority	 of	 one’s	 ultimate	 niche	 in	 society	 is
determined	by	non-IQ	factors,	ranging	from	social	class	to	luc k.”
Even	Richard	Herrnstein	and	Charles	Murray,	whose	bo ok	The	Bell
Curve 	imputes	a	primary	importance	to	IQ,	acknowledge	this; 	as	they
point	out,	“Perhaps	a	freshman	with	an	SAT	math	score 	of	500	had
better	not	have	his	heart	set	on	being	a	mathematicia n,	but	if	instead
he	wants	to	run	his	own	business,	become	a	U.S.	Sena tor	or	make	a
million	 dollars,	 he	 should	 not	 put	 aside	 his	 dreams.…	 The	 link
between	test	scores	and	those	achievements	is	dwarfe d	by	the	totality
of	other	characteristics	that	he	brings	to	life.” 3
My	 concern	 is	 with	 a	 key	 set	 of	 these	 “other	 charac teristics,”
emotional	intelligence: 	abilities	such	as	being	able	to	motivate	oneself
and	 persist	 in	 the	 face	 of	 frustrations;	 to	 control 	 impulse	 and	 delay
gratification;	 to	 regulate	 one’s	 moods	 and	 keep	 dist ress	 from
swamping	the	ability	to	think;	to	empathize	and	to	ho pe.	Unlike	IQ,
with	its	nearly	one-hundred-year	history	of	researc h	with	hundreds	of
thousands	of	people,	emotional	intelligence	is	a	new 	concept.	No	one
can	yet	say	exactly	how	much	of	the	variability	from	 person	to	person
in	life’s	course	it	accounts	for.	But	what	data	exi st	suggest	it	can	be	as
powerful,	and	at	times	more	powerful,	than	IQ.	And	wh ile	there	are
those	 who	 argue	 that	 IQ	 cannot	 be	 changed	 much	 by	 ex perience	 or
education,	 I	 will	 show	 in	 Part	 Five	 that	 the	 crucia l	 emotional
competencies	can	indeed	be	learned	and	improved	upon	by	childr en—
if	we	bother	to	teach	them.
EMOTIONAL	INTELLIGENCE	AND	DESTINY
I	remember	the	fellow	in	my	own	class	at	Amherst	Colleg e	who	had
attained	 five	 perfect	 800	 scores	 on	 the	 SAT	 and	 oth er	 achievement
tests	 he	 took	 before	 entering.	 Despite	 his	 formidabl e	 intellectual
======================================== [Página 53] ========================================

abilities,	he	spent	most	of	his	time	hanging	out,	sta ying	up	late,	and
missing	classes	by	sleeping	until	noon.	It	took	him	a lmost	ten	years	to
finally	get	his	degree.
IQ	 offers	 little	 to	 explain	 the	 different	 destinies 	 of	 people	 with
roughly	equal	promises,	schooling,	and	opportunity.	 When	ninety-five
Harvard	students	from	the	classes	of	the	1940s—a	time	w hen	people
with	a	wider	spread	of	IQ	were	at	Ivy	League	school s	than	is	presently
the	 case—were	 followed	 into	 middle	 age,	 the	 men	 with	 t he	 highest
test	 scores	 in	 college	 were	 not	 particularly	 succes sful	 compared	 to
their	lower-scoring	peers	in	terms	of	salary,	produc tivity,	or	status	in
their	 field.	 Nor	 did	 they	 have	 the	 greatest	 life	 sa tisfaction,	 nor	 the
most	happiness	with	friendships,	family,	and	romantic	relatio nships. 4
A	 similar	 follow-up	 in	 middle	 age	 was	 done	 with	 450	 b oys,	 most
sons	of	immigrants,	two	thirds	from	families	on	welfare ,	who	grew	up
in	 Somerville,	 Massachusetts,	 at	 the	 time	 a	 “blighted 	 slum”	 a	 few
blocks	 from	 Harvard.	 A	 third	 had	 IQs	 below	 90.	 But	 ag ain	 IQ	 had
little	relationship	to	how	well	they	had	done	at	wo rk	or	in	the	rest	of
their	 lives;	 for	 instance,	 7	 percent	 of	 men	 with	 IQs 	 under	 80	 were
unemployed	for	ten	or	more	years,	but	so	were	7	perce nt	of	men	with
IQs	over	100.	To	be	sure,	there	was	a	general	link	 (as	there	always	is)
between	IQ	and	socioeconomic	level	at	age	forty-seve n.	But	childhood
abilities	 such	 as	 being	 able	 to	 handle	 frustrations ,	 control	 emotions,
and	get	on	with	other	people	made	the	greater	difference. 5
Consider	 also	 data	 from	 an	 ongoing	 study	 of	 eighty-o ne
valedictorians	 and	 salutatorians	 from	 the	 1981	 class 	 in	 Illinois	 high
schools.	All,	of	course,	had	the	highest	grade-poin t	averages	in	their
schools.	But	while	they	continued	to	achieve	well	i n	college,	getting
excellent	 grades,	 by	 their	 late	 twenties	 they	 had	 c limbed	 to	 only
average	levels	of	success.	Ten	years	after	graduati ng	from	high	school,
only	 one	 in	 four	 were	 at	 the	 highest	 level	 of	 young 	 people	 of
comparable	 age	 in	 their	 chosen	 profession,	 and	 many	 w ere	 doing
much	less	well.
Karen	 Arnold,	 professor	 of	 education	 at	 Boston	 Univ ersity,	 one	 of
the	 researchers	 tracking	 the	 valedictorians,	 explai ns,	 “I	 think	 we’ve
discovered	 the	 ‘dutiful’—people	 who	 know	 how	 to	 achi eve	 in	 the
system.	 But	 valedictorians	 struggle	 as	 surely	 as	 we	 all	 do.	 To	 know
that	 a	 person	 is	 a	 valedictorian	 is	 to	 know	 only	 th at	 he	 or	 she	 is
exceedingly	good	at	achievement	as	measured	by	grades .	It	tells	you
nothing	about	how	they	react	to	the	vicissitudes	of	life.” 6
And	 that	 is	 the	 problem:	 academic	 intelligence	 offers 	 virtually	 no
======================================== [Página 54] ========================================

preparation	for	the	turmoil—or	opportunity—life’s	vici ssitudes	bring.
Yet	even	though	a	high	IQ	is	no	guarantee	of	prospe rity,	prestige,	or
happiness	 in	 life,	 our	 schools	 and	 our	 culture	 fixa te	 on	 academic
abilities,	 ignoring	 emotional 	 intelligence,	 a	 set	 of	 traits—some	 might
call	 it	 character—that	 also	 matters	 immensely	 for	 our	 p ersonal
destiny.	Emotional	life	is	a	domain	that,	as	surely	a s	math	or	reading,
can	be	handled	with	greater	or	lesser	skill,	and	re quires	its	unique	set
of	 competencies.	 And	 how	 adept	 a	 person	 is	 at	 those	 is	 crucial	 to
understanding	why	one	person	thrives	in	life	while	 another,	of	equal
intellect,	dead-ends:	emotional	aptitude	is	a	 meta-ability ,	determining
how	 well	 we	 can	 use	 whatever	 other	 skills	 we	 have,	 including	 raw
intellect.
Of	 course,	 there	 are	 many	 paths	 to	 success	 in	 life,	 and	 many
domains	 in	 which	 other	 aptitudes	 are	 rewarded.	 In	 ou r	 increasingly
knowledge-based	 society,	 technical	 skill	 is	 certain ly	 one.	 There	 is	 a
children’s	 joke:	 “What	 do	 you	 call	 a	 nerd	 fifteen	 y ears	 from	 now?”
The	 answer:	 “Boss.”	 But	 even	 among	 “nerds”	 emotional	 intelligence
offers	an	added	edge	in	the	workplace,	as	we	shall	 see	in	Part	Three.
Much	evidence	testifies	that	people	who	are	emotiona lly	adept—who
know	 and	 manage	 their	 own	 feelings	 well,	 and	 who	 rea d	 and	 deal
effectively	 with	 other	 people’s	 feelings—are	 at	 an	 a dvantage	 in	 any
domain	of	life,	whether	romance	and	intimate	relations hips	or	picking
up	the	unspoken	rules	that	govern	success	in	organi zational	politics.
People	with	well-developed	emotional	skills	are	also 	more	likely	to	be
content	and	effective	in	their	lives,	mastering	the	 habits	of	mind	that
foster	 their	 own	 productivity;	 people	 who	 cannot	 mar shal	 some
control	over	their	emotional	life	fight	inner	battle s	that	sabotage	their
ability	for	focused	work	and	clear	thought.
A	DIFFERENT	KIND	OF	INTELLIGENCE
To	 the	 casual	 observer,	 four-year-old	 Judy	 might	 see m	 a	 wallflower
among	 her	 more	 gregarious	 playmates.	 She	 hangs	 back	 fr om	 the
action	 at	 playtime,	 staying	 on	 the	 margins	 of	 games	 ra ther	 than
plunging	into	the	center.	But	Judy	is	actually	a	ke en	observer	of	the
social	 politics	 of	 her	 preschool	 classroom,	 perhaps	 the	 most
sophisticated	of	her	playmates	in	her	insights	into	 the	tides	of	feeling
within	the	others.
Her	sophistication	is	not	apparent	until	Judy’s	teac her	gathers	the
======================================== [Página 55] ========================================

four-year-olds	around	to	play	what	they	call	the	Cla ssroom	Game.	The
Classroom	 Game—a	 dollhouse	 replica	 of	 Judy’s	 own	 presc hool
classroom,	with	stick	figures	who	have	for	heads	smal l	photos	of	the
students	and	teachers—is	a	test	of	social	perceptive ness.	When	Judy’s
teacher	asks	her	to	put	each	girl	and	boy	in	the	pa rt	of	the	room	they
like	to	play	in	most—the	art	corner,	the	blocks	corne r,	and	so	on—
Judy	 does	 so	 with	 complete	 accuracy.	 And	 when	 asked	 to	 put	 each
boy	and	girl	with	the	children	they	like	to	play	wi th	most,	Judy	shows
she	can	match	best	friends	for	the	entire	class.
Judy’s	 accuracy	 reveals	 that	 she	 has	 a	 perfect	 soci al	 map	 of	 her
class,	a	level	of	perceptiveness	exceptional	for	a	 four-year-old.	These
are	the	skills	that,	in	later	life,	might	allow	Judy 	to	blossom	into	a	star
in	 any	 of	 the	 fields	 where	 “people	 skills”	 count,	 f rom	 sales	 and
management	to	diplomacy.
That	Judy’s	social	brilliance	was	spotted	at	all,	l et	alone	this	early,
was	due	to	her	being	a	student	at	the	Eliot-Pearson 	Preschool	on	the
campus	 of	 Tufts	 University,	 where	 Project	 Spectrum,	 a 	 curriculum
that	 intentionally	 cultivates	 a	 variety	 of	 kinds	 of 	 intelligence,	 was
then	 being	 developed.	 Project	 Spectrum	 recognizes	 th at	 the	 human
repertoire	of	abilities	goes	far	beyond	the	three	R ’s,	the	narrow	band
of	 word-and-number	 skills	 that	 schools	 traditionally 	 focus	 on.	 It
acknowledges	that	capacities	such	as	Judy’s	social	 perceptiveness	are
talents	 that	 an	 education	 can	 nurture	 rather	 than	 i gnore	 or	 even
frustrate.	 By	 encouraging	 children	 to	 develop	 a	 ful l	 range	 of	 the
abilities	that	they	will	actually	draw	on	to	succee d,	or	use	simply	to
be	fulfilled	in	what	they	do,	school	becomes	an	education	in	li fe	skills.
The	guiding	visionary	behind	Project	Spectrum	is	Howa rd	Gardner,
a	 psychologist	 at	 the	 Harvard	 School	 of	 Education. 7	 “The	 time	 has
come,”	Gardner	told	 me,	“to	broaden	 our	notion	of	 the 	spectrum	of
talents.	The	single	most	important	contribution	educa tion	can	make	to
a	child’s	development	is	to	help	him	toward	a	field	w here	his	talents
best	 suit	 him,	 where	 he	 will	 be	 satisfied	 and	 compete nt.	 We’ve
completely	 lost	 sight	 of	 that.	 Instead	 we	 subject	 ev eryone	 to	 an
education	 where,	 if	 you	 succeed,	 you	 will	 be	 best	 s uited	 to	 be	 a
college	professor.	And	we	evaluate	everyone	along	t he	way	according
to	 whether	 they	 meet	 that	 narrow	 standard	 of	 success .	 We	 should
spend	 less	 time	 ranking	 children	 and	 more	 time	 helping 	 them	 to
identify	 their	 natural	 competencies	 and	 gifts,	 and	 c ultivate	 those.
There	 are	 hundreds	 and	 hundreds	 of	 ways	 to	 succeed, 	 and	 many,
many	different	abilities	that	will	help	you	get	there.” 8
======================================== [Página 56] ========================================

If	 anyone	 sees	 the	 limits	 of	 the	 old	 ways	 of	 thinkin g	 about
intelligence,	it	is	Gardner.	He	points	out	that	the	 glory	days	of	the	IQ
tests	 began	 during	 World	 War	 I,	 when	 two	 million	 Amer ican	 men
were	sorted	out	through	the	first	mass	paper-and-pencil	fo rm	of	the	IQ
test,	freshly	developed	by	Lewis	Terman,	a	psycholog ist	at	Stanford.
This	led	to	decades	of	what	Gardner	calls	the	“IQ	w ay	of	thinking”:
“that	people	are	either	smart	or	not,	are	born	that	 way,	that	there’s
nothing	much	you	can	do	about	it,	and	that	tests	can 	tell	you	if	you
are	one	of	the	smart	ones	or	not.	The	SAT	test	for	c ollege	admissions
is	 based	 on	 the	 same	 notion	 of	 a	 single	 kind	 of	 apti tude	 that
determines	your	future.	This	way	of	thinking	permeates	societ y.”
Gardner’s	 influential	 1983	 book	 Frames	of	Mind	was 	 a	 manifesto
refuting	 the	 IQ	 view;	 it	 proposed	 that	 there	 was	 no t	 just	 one,
monolithic	 kind	 of	 intelligence	 that	 was	 crucial	 for 	 life	 success,	 but
rather	a	wide	spectrum	of	intelligences,	with	seven	 key	varieties.	His
list	 includes	 the	 two	 standard	 academic	 kinds,	 verba l	 and
mathematical-logical	 alacrity,	 but	 it	 goes	 on	 to	 incl ude	 the	 spatial
capacity	seen	in,	say,	an	outstanding	artist	or	arc hitect;	the	kinesthetic
genius	 displayed	 in	 the	 physical	 fluidity	 and	 grace 	 of	 a	 Martha
Graham	or	Magic	Johnson;	and	the	musical	gifts	of	a	M ozart	or	YoYo
Ma.	 Rounding	 out	 the	 list	 are	 two	 faces	 of	 what	 Gar dner	 calls	 “the
personal	 intelligences”:	 interpersonal	 skills,	 like 	 those	 of	 a	 great
therapist	such	as	Carl	Rogers	or	a	world-class	lead er	such	as	Martin
Luther	 King,	 Jr.,	 and	 the	 “intrapsychic”	 capacity	 t hat	 could	 emerge,
on	the	one	hand,	in	the	brilliant	insights	of	Sigmun d	Freud,	or,	with
less	fanfare,	in	the	inner	contentment	that	arises	f rom	attuning	one’s
life	to	be	in	keeping	with	one’s	true	feelings.
The	 operative	 word	 in	 this	 view	 of	 intelligences	 is 	multiple:
Gardner’s	model	pushes	way	beyond	the	standard	conce pt	of	IQ	as	a
single,	immutable	factor.	It	recognizes	that	the	test s	that	tyrannized	us
as	we	went	through	school—from	the	achievement	tests	t hat	sorted	us
out	 into	 those	 who	 would	 be	 shunted	 toward	 technica l	 schools	 and
those	destined	for	college,	to	the	SATs	that	determi ned	what,	if	any,
college	we	would	be	allowed	to	attend—are	based	on	a 	limited	notion
of	 intelligence,	 one	 out	 of	 touch	 with	 the	 true	 ran ge	 of	 skills	 and
abilities	that	matter	for	life	over	and	beyond	IQ.
Gardner	 acknowledges	 that	 seven	 is	 an	 arbitrary	 fig ure	 for	 the
variety	of	intelligences;	there	is	no	magic	number	to 	the	multiplicity
of	human	talents.	At	one	point,	Gardner	and	his	rese arch	colleagues
had	 stretched	 these	 seven	 to	 a	 list	 of	 twenty	 diffe rent	 varieties	 of
======================================== [Página 57] ========================================

intelligence.	Interpersonal	intelligence,	for	exampl e,	broke	down	into
four	 distinct	 abilities:	 leadership,	 the	 ability	 to 	 nurture	 relationships
and	keep	friends,	the	ability	to	resolve	conflicts, 	and	skill	at	the	kind
of	social	analysis	that	four-year-old	Judy	excels	at.
This	 multifaceted	 view	 of	 intelligence	 offers	 a	 rich er	 picture	 of	 a
child’s	 ability	 and	 potential	 for	 success	 than	 the	 standard	 IQ.	 When
Spectrum	students	were	evaluated	on	the	Stanford-Bin et	Intelligence
Scale—once	 the	 gold	 standard	 of	 IQ	 tests—and	 again	 by 	 a	 battery
designed	to	measure	Gardner’s	spectrum	of	intelligenc es,	there	was	no
significant	 relationship	 between	 children’s	 scores	 on	 the	 two	 tests. 9
The	 five	 children	 with	 the	 highest	 IQs	 (from	 125	 to	 133)	 showed	 a
variety	of	profiles	on	the	ten	strengths	measured	by 	the	Spectrum	test.
For	example,	of	the	five	“smartest”	children	accordin g	to	the	IQ	tests,
one	was	strong	in	three	areas,	three	had	strengths	 in	two	areas,	and
one	 “smart”	 child	 had	 just	 one	 Spectrum	 strength.	 Tho se	 strengths
were	scattered:	four	of	these	children’s	strengths	 were	in	music,	two
in	 the	 visual	 arts,	 one	 in	 social	 understanding,	 on e	 in	 logic,	 two	 in
language.	 None	 of	 the	 five	 high-IQ	 kids	 were	 strong 	 in	 movement,
numbers,	or	mechanics;	movement	and	numbers	were	actuall y	weak
spots	for	two	of	these	five.
Gardner’s	conclusion	was	that	“the	Stanford-Binet	I ntelligence	Scale
did	not	predict	successful	performance	across	or	on	 a	consistent	subset
of	Spectrum	activities.”	On	the	other	hand,	the	Spec trum	scores	give
parents	 and	 teachers	 clear	 guidance	 about	 the	 realms 	 that	 these
children	will	take	a	spontaneous	interest	in,	and	w here	they	will	do
well	enough	to	develop	the	passions	that	could	one	 day	lead	beyond
proficiency	to	mastery.
Gardner’s	 thinking	 about	 the	 multiplicity	 of	 intelli gence	 continues
to	evolve.	Some	ten	years	after	he	first	published	h is	theory,	Gardner
gave	these	nutshell	summaries	of	the	personal	intelligences:
Interpersonal 	 intelligence	 is	 the	 ability	 to	 understand	 other	 peop le:	 what	 motivates
them,	how	they	work,	how	to	work	cooperatively	with	them.	S uccessful	salespeople,
politicians,	 teachers,	 clinicians,	 and	 religious	 lea ders	 are	 all	 likely	 to	 be	 individuals
with	 high	 degrees	 of	 interpersonal	 intelligence.	 Intrapersonal	 intelligence	 …	 is	 a
correlative	ability,	turned	inward.	It	is	a	capacit y	to	form	an	accurate,	veridical	model
of	oneself	and	to	be	able	to	use	that	model	to	operate	 effectively	in	life.10
In	another	rendering,	Gardner	noted	that	the	core	o f	interpersonal
intelligence	 includes	 the	 “capacities	 to	 discern	 an d	 respond
======================================== [Página 58] ========================================

appropriately	 to	 the	 moods,	 temperaments,	 motivations,	 and	 desires
of	 other	 people.”	 In	 intrapersonal	 intelligence,	 th e	 key	 to	 self-
knowledge,	he	included	“access	to	one’s	own	feeling s	and	the	ability
to	 discriminate	 among	 them	 and	 draw	 upon	 them	 to	 guide
behavior.” 11
SPOCK	VS.	DATA:	WHEN	COGNITION	IS	NOT	ENOUGH
There	is	one	dimension	of	personal	intelligence	that	is	broad ly	pointed
to,	but	little	explored,	in	Gardner’s	elaborations: 	the	role	of	emotions.
Perhaps	this	is	so	because,	as	Gardner	suggested	to 	me,	his	work	is	so
strongly	 informed	 by	 a	 cognitive-science	 model	 of	 mind .	 Thus	 his
view	of	these	intelligences	emphasizes	cognition—the	 understanding 	of
oneself	and	of	others	in	motives,	in	habits	of	worki ng,	and	in	putting
that	 insight	 into	 use	 in	 conducting	 one’s	 own	 life	 and	 getting	 along
with	others.	But	like	the	kinesthetic	realm,	where	p hysical	brilliance
manifests	itself	nonverbally,	the	realm	of	the	emotion s	extends,	too,
beyond	the	reach	of	language	and	cognition.
While	there	is	ample	room	in	Gardner’s	descriptions	o f	the	personal
intelligences	 for	 insight	 into	 the	 play	 of	 emotions	 and	 mastery	 in
managing	 them,	 Gardner	 and	 those	 who	 work	 with	 him	 hav e	 not
pursued	 in	 great	 detail	 the	 role	 of	 feeling 	 in	 these	 intelligences,
focusing	 more	 on	 cognitions	 about 	 feeling.	 This	 focus,	 perhaps
unintentionally,	 leaves	 unexplored	 the	 rich	 sea	 of	 emotions	 that
makes	the	inner	life	and	relationships	so	complex,	so 	compelling,	and
so	often	puzzling.	And	it	leaves	yet	to	be	plumbed	b oth	the	sense	in
which	 there	 is	 intelligence	 in	 the	 emotions	 and	 the	 sense	 in	 which
intelligence	can	be	brought	 to	emotions.
Gardner’s	 emphasis	 on	 the	 cognitive	 elements	 in	 the	 p ersonal
intelligences	 reflects	 the	 zeitgeist	 of	 psychology	 that	 has	 shaped	 his
views.	Psychology’s	overemphasis	on	cognition	even	i n	the	realm	of
emotion	 is,	 in	 part,	 due	 to	 a	 quirk	 in	 the	 history	 o f	 that	 science.
During	the	middle	decades	of	this	century	academic	ps ychology	was
dominated	by	behaviorists	in	the	mold	of	B.	F.	Skinne r,	who	felt	that
only	behavior	that	could	be	seen	objectively,	from	t he	outside,	could
be	 studied	 with	 scientific	 accuracy.	 The	 behavioris ts	 ruled	 all	 inner
life,	including	emotions,	out-of-bounds	for	science.
Then,	 with	 the	 coming	 in	 the	 late	 1960s	 of	 the	 “cogn itive
revolution,”	 the	 focus	 of	 psychological	 science	 tur ned	 to	 how	 the
======================================== [Página 59] ========================================

mind	registers	and	stores	information,	and	the	nature 	of	intelligence.
But	 emotions	 were	 still	 off-limits.	 Conventional	 wisd om	 among
cognitive	 scientists	 held	 that	 intelligence	 entails 	 a	 cold,	 hard-nosed
processing	of	fact.	It	is	hyperrational,	rather	lik e	Star	Treks 	Mr.	Spock,
the	 archetype	 of	 dry	 information	 bytes	 unmuddied	 by	 f eeling,
embodying	the	idea	that	emotions	have	no	place	in	int elligence	and
only	muddle	our	picture	of	mental	life.
The	cognitive	scientists	who	embraced	this	view	have 	been	seduced
by	the	computer	as	the	operative	model	of	mind,	forget ting	that,	in
reality,	the	brain’s	wetware	is	awash	in	a	messy,	pu lsating	puddle	of
neurochemicals,	 nothing	 like	 the	 sanitized,	 orderly	 silicon	 that	 has
spawned	 the	 guiding	 metaphor	 for	 mind.	 The	 predominant 	 models
among	 cognitive	 scientists	 of	 how	 the	 mind	 processes	 information
have	 lacked	 an	 acknowledgment	 that	 rationality	 is	 gu ided	 by—and
can	be	swamped	by—feeling.	The	cognitive	model	is,	in	 this	regard,
an	impoverished	view	of	the	mind,	one	that	fails	to	e xplain	the	Sturm
und	 Drang	 of	 feelings	 that	 brings	 flavor	 to	 the	 int ellect.	 In	 order	 to
persist	in	this	view,	cognitive	scientists	themselve s	have	had	to	ignore
the	 relevance	 for	 their	 models	 of	 mind	 of	 their	 perso nal	 hopes	 and
fears,	their	marital	squabbles	and	professional	jeal ousies—the	wash	of
feeling	that	gives	life	its	flavor	and	its	urgencie s,	and	which	in	every
moment	biases	exactly	how	(and	how	well	or	poorly)	in formation	is
processed.
The	 lopsided	 scientific	 vision	 of	 an	 emotionally	 fla t	 mental	 life—
which	has	guided	the	last	eighty	years	of	research	 on	intelligence—is
gradually	changing	as	psychology	has	begun	to	recog nize	the	essential
role	of	feeling	in	thinking.	Rather	like	the	Spocki sh	character	Data	in
Star	Trek:	The	Next	Generation ,	psychology	is	coming	to	appreciate	the
power	and	virtues	of	emotions	in	mental	life,	as	well 	as	their	dangers.
After	all,	as	Data	sees	(to	his	own	dismay,	could	he 	feel	dismay),	his
cool	 logic	 fails	 to	 bring	 the	 right	 human 	 solution.	 Our	 humanity	 is
most	 evident	 in	 our	 feelings;	 Data	 seeks	 to	 feel,	 kn owing	 that
something	essential	is	missing.	He	wants	friendship,	 loyalty;	like	the
Tin	 Man	 in	The	Wizard	of	Oz ,	 he	 lacks	 a	 heart.	 Lacking	 the	 lyrical
sense	 that	 feeling	 brings,	 Data	 can	 play	 music	 or	 wr ite	 poetry	 with
technical	 virtuosity,	 but	 not	 feel	 its	 passion.	 The 	 lesson	 of	 Data’s
yearning	 for	 yearning	 itself	 is	 that	 the	 higher	 val ues	 of	 the	 human
heart—faith,	 hope,	 devotion,	 love—are	 missing	 entirely 	 from	 the
coldly	cognitive	view.	Emotions	enrich;	a	model	of	min d	that	leaves
them	out	is	impoverished.
======================================== [Página 60] ========================================

When	 I	 asked	 Gardner	 about	 his	 emphasis	 on	 thoughts	 about
feelings,	 or	 metacognition,	 more	 than	 on	 emotions	 thems elves,	 he
acknowledged	that	he	tended	to	view	intelligence	in 	a	cognitive	way,
but	 told	 me,	 “When	 I	 first	 wrote	 about	 the	 personal	 intelligences,	 I
was	 talking	 about	 emotion,	 especially	 in	 my	 notion	 of	 in trapersonal
intelligence—one	component	is	emotionally	tuning	in	to 	yourself.	It’s
the	visceral-feeling	signals	you	get	that	are	essen tial	for	interpersonal
intelligence.	But	as	it	has	developed	in	practice,	 the	theory	of	multiple
intelligence	 has	 evolved	 to	 focus	 more	 on	 metacogniti on”—that	 is,
awareness	of	one’s	mental	processes—“rather	than	on	t he	full	range	of
emotional	abilities.”
Even	 so,	 Gardner	 appreciates	 how	 crucial	 these	 emoti onal	 and
relationship	abilities	are	in	the	rough-and-tumble	o f	life.	He	points	out
that	“many	people	with	IQs	of	160	work	for	people	wi th	IQs	of	100,	if
the	former	have	poor	intrapersonal	intelligence	and	 the	latter	have	a
high	 one.	 And	 in	 the	 day-to-day	 world	 no	 intelligen ce	 is	 more
important	 than	 the	 interpersonal.	 If	 you	 don’t	 have	 it,	 you’ll	 make
poor	 choices	 about	 who	 to	 marry,	 what	 job	 to	 take,	 a nd	 so	 on.	 We
need	to	train	children	in	the	personal	intelligences	in	scho ol.”
CAN	EMOTIONS	BE	INTELLIGENT?
To	get	a	fuller	understanding	of	just	what	such	tra ining	might	be	like,
we	must	turn	to	other	theorists	who	agree	with	Gardn er’s	view—most
notably	 psychologists	 Peter	 Salovey	 and	 John	 Mayer. 	 They	 have
mapped	in	great	detail	the	ways	in	which	we	can	brin g	intelligence	to
our	 emotions. 12	 This	 endeavor	 is	 not	 new;	 over	 the	 years	 even	 the
most	ardent	theorists	of	IQ	have	occasionally	tried	 to	bring	emotions
within	the	domain	of	intelligence,	rather	than	seein g	“emotion”	and
“intelligence”	 as	 an	 inherent	 contradiction	 in	 terms .	 Thus	 E.	 L.
Thorndike,	 an	 eminent	 psychologist	 who	 was	 also	 infl uential	 in
popularizing	the	notion	of	IQ	in	the	1920s	and	1930 s,	proposed	in	a
Harper’s	Magazine 	 article	 that	 one	 aspect	 of	 emotional	 intelligence,
“social”	intelligence—the	ability	to	understand	othe rs	and	“act	wisely
in	 human	 relations”—was	 itself	 an	 aspect	 of	 a	 person’ s	 IQ.	 Other
psychologists	 of	 the	 time	 took	 a	 more	 cynical	 view	 of 	 social
intelligence,	seeing	it	in	terms	of	skills	for	manipu lating	other	people
—getting	them	to	do	what	you	want,	whether	they	want	 to	or	not.	But
neither	 of	 these	 formulations	 of	 social	 intelligence 	 held	 much	 sway
======================================== [Página 61] ========================================

with	 theorists	 of	 IQ,	 and	 by	 1960	 an	 influential	 te xtbook	 on
intelligence	tests	pronounced	social	intelligence	a	“usel ess”	concept.
But	personal	intelligence	would	not	be	ignored,	main ly	because	it
makes	 both	 intuitive	 and	 common	 sense.	 For	 example,	 whe n	 Yale
psychologist	Robert	Sternberg	asked	people	to	descr ibe	an	“intelligent
person,”	 practical	 people	 skills	 were	 among	 the	 main	 traits	 listed.
More	 systematic	 research	 by	 Sternberg	 led	 him	 back	 to 	 Thorndike’s
conclusion:	 that	 social	 intelligence	 is	 both	 distin ct	 from	 academic
abilities	 and	 a	 key	 part	 of	 what	 makes	 people	 do	 wel l	 in	 the
practicalities	 of	 life.	 Among	 the	 practical	 intellig ences	 that	 are,	 for
instance,	so	highly	valued	in	the	workplace	is	the	 kind	of	sensitivity
that	allows	effective	managers	to	pick	up	tacit	messages. 13
In	 recent	 years	 a	 growing	 group	 of	 psychologists	 ha s	 come	 to
similar	conclusions,	agreeing	with	Gardner	that	the	 old	concepts	of	IQ
revolved	around	a	narrow	band	of	linguistic	and	math 	skills,	and	that
doing	well	on	IQ	tests	was	most	directly	a	predictor 	of	success	in	the
classroom	or	as	a	professor	but	less	and	less	so	as	 life’s	paths	diverged
from	 academe.	 These	 psychologists—Sternberg	 and	 Salove y	 among
them—have	taken	a	wider	view	of	intelligence,	trying	 to	reinvent	it	in
terms	 of	 what	 it	 takes	 to	 lead	 life	 successfully.	 An d	 that	 line	 of
enquiry	leads	back	to	an	appreciation	of	just	how	c rucial	“personal”
or	emotional	intelligence	is.
Salovey,	 with	 his	 colleague	 John	 Mayer,	 offered	 an	 elaborated
definition	of	emotional	intelligence,	expanding	thes e	abilities	into	five
main	domains: 14
1.	Knowing	one’s	emotions .	Self-awareness—recognizing	a	feeling	 as
it	happens —is	the	keystone	of	emotional	intelligence.	As	we	wil l	see	in
Chapter	4 ,	the	ability	to	monitor	feelings	from	moment	to	moment	i s
crucial	to	psychological	insight	and	self-understan ding.	An	inability	to
notice	our	true	feelings	leaves	us	at	their	mercy.	P eople	with	greater
certainty	about	their	feelings	are	better	pilots	of 	their	lives,	having	a
surer	 sense	 of	 how	 they	 really	 feel	 about	 personal	 decisions	 from
whom	to	marry	to	what	job	to	take.
2.	Managing	emotions .	 Handling	 feelings	 so	 they	 are	 appropriate	 is
an	 ability	 that	 builds	 on	 self-awareness.	 Chapter	 5 	 will	 examine	 the
capacity	 to	 soothe	 oneself,	 to	 shake	 off	 rampant	 anx iety,	 gloom,	 or
irritability—and	 the	 consequences	 of	 failure	 at	 this 	 basic	 emotional
skill.	 People	 who	 are	 poor	 in	 this	 ability	 are	 cons tantly	 battling
feelings	of	distress,	while	those	who	excel	in	it	c an	bounce	back	far
======================================== [Página 62] ========================================

more	quickly	from	life’s	setbacks	and	upsets.
3.	Motivating	oneself .	As	 Chapter	6 	will	show,	marshaling	emotions
in	 the	 service	 of	 a	 goal	 is	 essential	 for	 paying	 at tention,	 for	 self-
motivation	 and	 mastery,	 and	 for	 creativity.	 Emotional	 self-control—
delaying	 gratification	 and	 stifling	 impulsiveness—und erlies
accomplishment	of	every	sort.	And	being	able	to	get	i nto	the	“flow”
state	enables	outstanding	performance	of	all	kinds.	 People	who	have
this	skill	tend	to	be	more	highly	productive	and	eff ective	in	whatever
they	undertake.
4.	Recognizing	emotions	in	others .	 Empathy,	 another	 ability	 that
builds	on	emotional	self-awareness,	is	the	fundamenta l	“people	skill.”
Chapter	 7 	 will	 investigate	 the	 roots	 of	 empathy,	 the	 social	 c ost	 of
being	 emotionally	 tone-deaf,	 and	 the	 reason	 empathy	 k indles
altruism.	 People	 who	 are	 empathic	 are	 more	 attuned	 to	 the	 subtle
social	 signals	 that	 indicate	 what	 others	 need	 or	 wa nt.	 This	 makes
them	better	at	callings	such	as	the	caring	professio ns,	teaching,	sales,
and	management.
5.	Handling	relationships .	 The	 art	 of	 relationships	 is,	 in	 large	 part,
skill	 in	 managing	 emotions	 in	 others.	 Chapter	 8 	 looks	 at	 social
competence	and	incompetence,	and	the	specific	skills	 involved.	These
are	 the	 abilities	 that	 undergird	 popularity,	 leader ship,	 and
interpersonal	effectiveness.	People	who	excel	in	th ese	skills	do	well	at
anything	 that	 relies	 on	 interacting	 smoothly	 with	 ot hers;	 they	 are
social	stars.
Of	course,	people	differ	in	their	abilities	in	each 	of	these	domains;
some	of	us	may	be	quite	adept	at	handling,	say,	our	o wn	anxiety,	but
relatively	 inept	 at	 soothing	 someone	 else’s	 upsets.	 The	 underlying
basis	for	our	level	of	ability	is,	no	doubt,	neural ,	but	as	we	will	see,
the	 brain	 is	 remarkably	 plastic,	 constantly	 learning .	 Lapses	 in
emotional	 skills	 can	 be	 remedied:	 to	 a	 great	 extent	 e ach	 of	 these
domains	represents	a	body	of	habit	and	response	that ,	with	the	right
effort,	can	be	improved	on.
IQ	AND	EMOTIONAL	INTELLIGENCE:	PURE	TYPES
IQ	 and	 emotional	 intelligence	 are	 not	 opposing	 compet encies,	 but
rather	 separate	 ones.	 We	 all	 mix	 intellect	 and	 emotio nal	 acuity;
people	with	a	high	IQ	but	low	emotional	intelligence 	(or	low	IQ	and
======================================== [Página 63] ========================================

high	 emotional	 intelligence)	 are,	 despite	 the	 stereo types,	 relatively
rare.	Indeed,	there	is	a	slight	correlation	between 	IQ	and	some	aspects
of	emotional	intelligence—though	small	enough	to	make	c lear	these
are	largely	independent	entities.
Unlike	the	familiar	tests	for	IQ,	there	is,	as	yet,	 no	single	paper-and-
pencil	test	that	yields	an	“emotional	intelligence	s core”	and	there	may
never	 be	 one.	 Although	 there	 is	 ample	 research	 on	 ea ch	 of	 its
components,	 some	 of	 them,	 such	 as	 empathy,	 are	 best	 tes ted	 by
sampling	a	person’s	actual	ability	at	the	task—for	ex ample,	by	having
them	read	a	person’s	feelings	from	a	video	of	their	f acial	expressions.
Still,	using	a	measure	for	what	he	calls	“ego	resili ence”	which	is	quite
similar	 to	 emotional	 intelligence	 (it	 includes	 the	 mai n	 social	 and
emotional	competences),	Jack	Block,	a	psychologist	at 	the	University
of	California	at	Berkeley,	has	made	a	comparison	of	t wo	theoretical
pure	 types:	 people	 high	 in	 IQ	 versus	 people	 high	 in 	 emotional
aptitudes. 15	The	differences	are	telling.
The	high-IQ	pure	type	(that	is,	setting	aside	emotio nal	intelligence)
is	almost	a	caricature	of	the	intellectual,	adept	in 	the	realm	of	mind
but	 inept	 in	 the	 personal	 world.	 The	 profiles	 diffe r	 slightly	 for	 men
and	 women.	 The	 high-IQ	 male	 is	 typified—no	 surprise—by	 a	 wide
range	 of	 intellectual	 interests	 and	 abilities.	 He	 is 	 ambitious	 and
productive,	 predictable	 and	 dogged,	 and	 untroubled	 by	 concerns
about	 himself.	 He	 also	 tends	 to	 be	 critical	 and	 conde scending,
fastidious	 and	 inhibited,	 uneasy	 with	 sexuality	 and 	 sensual
experience,	 unexpressive	 and	 detached,	 and	 emotional ly	 bland	 and
cold.
By	contrast,	men	who	are	high	in	emotional	intelligenc e	are	socially
poised,	 outgoing	 and	 cheerful,	 not	 prone	 to	 fearful ness	 or	 worried
rumination.	They	have	a	notable	capacity	for	commitment 	to	people
or	causes,	for	taking	responsibility,	and	for	havin g	an	ethical	outlook;
they	 are	 sympathetic	 and	 caring	 in	 their	 relationshi ps.	 Their
emotional	 life	 is	 rich,	 but	 appropriate;	 they	 are	 co mfortable	 with
themselves,	others,	and	the	social	universe	they	live	in.
Purely	 high-IQ	 women	 have	 the	 expected	 intellectual	 confidence,
are	fluent	in	expressing	their	thoughts,	value	inte llectual	matters,	and
have	 a	 wide	 range	 of	 intellectual	 and	 aesthetic	 int erests.	 They	 also
tend	to	be	introspective,	prone	to	anxiety,	ruminati on,	and	guilt,	and
hesitate	to	express	their	anger	openly	(though	they	do	so	ind irectly).
Emotionally	intelligent	women,	by	contrast,	tend	to	be	assert ive	and
express	their	feelings	directly,	and	to	feel	positi ve	about	themselves;
======================================== [Página 64] ========================================

life	 holds	 meaning	 for	 them.	 Like	 the	 men,	 they	 are	 ou tgoing	 and
gregarious,	and	express	their	feelings	appropriatel y	(rather	than,	say,
in	outbursts	they	later	regret);	they	adapt	well	to 	stress.	Their	social
poise	lets	them	easily	reach	out	to	new	people;	they 	are	comfortable
enough	 with	 themselves	 to	 be	 playful,	 spontaneous,	 a nd	 open	 to
sensual	experience.	Unlike	the	women	purely	high	in	 IQ,	they	rarely
feel	anxious	or	guilty,	or	sink	into	rumination.
These	 portraits,	 of	 course,	 are	 extremes—all	 of	 us	 mix 	 IQ	 and
emotional	intelligence	in	varying	degrees.	But	they	offer	an 	instructive
look	at	what	each	of	these	dimensions	adds	separatel y	to	a	person’s
qualities.	 To	 the	 degree	 a	 person	 has	 both	 cognitiv e	 and	 emotional
intelligence,	 these	 pictures	 merge.	 Still,	 of	 the	 tw o,	 emotional
intelligence	 adds	 far	 more	 of	 the	 qualities	 that	 make 	 us	 more	 fully
human.

Know	Thyself
A	 belligerent	 samurai,	 an	 old	 Japanese	 tale	 goes,	 on ce	 challenged	 a
Zen	master	to	explain	the	concept	of	heaven	and	hell. 	But	the	monk
replied	with	scorn,	“You’re	nothing	but	a	lout—I	can ’t	waste	my	time
with	the	likes	of	you!”
His	very	honor	attacked,	the	samurai	flew	into	a	rag e	and,	pulling
his	 sword	 from	 its	 scabbard,	 yelled,	 “I	 could	 kill	 y ou	 for	 your
impertinence.”	“That,”	the	monk	calmly	replied,	“is	hell.”
Startled	 at	 seeing	 the	 truth	 in	 what	 the	 master	 poin ted	 out	 about
the	fury	that	had	him	in	its	grip,	the	samurai	calmed	 down,	sheathed
his	sword,	and	bowed,	thanking	the	monk	for	the	insight.
“And	that,”	said	the	monk,	“is	heaven.”
The	 sudden	 awakening	 of	 the	 samurai	 to	 his	 own	 agita ted	 state
illustrates	the	crucial	difference	between	being	ca ught	up	in	a	feeling
and	becoming	aware	that	you	are	being	swept	away	by	 it.	Socrates’s
injunction	 “Know	 thyself”	 speaks	 to	 this	 keystone	 o f	 emotional
intelligence:	awareness	of	one’s	own	feelings	as	they	occur .
It	 might	 seem	 at	 first	 glance	 that	 our	 feelings	 are	 o bvious;	 more
thoughtful	 reflection	 reminds	 us	 of	 times	 we	 have	 bee n	 all	 too
oblivious	to	what	we	really	felt	about	something,	or 	awoke	to	these
feelings	late	in	the	game.	Psychologists	use	the	rat her	ponderous	term
metacognition 	 to	 refer	 to	 an	 awareness	 of	 thought	 process,	 and
metamood 	to	mean	awareness	of	one’s	own	emotions.	I	prefer	th e	term
self-awareness ,	 in	 the	 sense	 of	 an	 ongoing	 attention	 to	 one’s	 int ernal
states. 1	In	this	self-reflexive	awareness	mind	observes	and	 investigates
experience	itself,	including	the	emotions. 2
This	 quality	 of	 awareness	 is	 akin	 to	 what	 Freud	 des cribed	 as	 an
“evenly	hovering	attention,”	and	which	he	commended	t o	those	who
would	 do	 psychoanalysis.	 Such	 attention	 takes	 in	 wh atever	 passes
through	awareness	with	impartiality,	as	an	intereste d	yet	unreactive
witness.	Some	psychoanalysts	call	it	the	“observing	 ego,”	the	capacity
of	self-awareness	that	allows	the	analyst	to	monitor 	his	own	reactions
to	 what	 the	 patient	 is	 saying,	 and	 which	 the	 proces s	 of	 free
======================================== [Página 66] ========================================

association	nurtures	in	the	patient. 3
Such	self-awareness	would	seem	to	require	an	activat ed	neocortex,
particularly	 the	 language	 areas,	 attuned	 to	 identif y	 and	 name	 the
emotions	being	aroused.	Self-awareness	is	not	an	att ention	that	gets
carried	 away	 by	 emotions,	 overreacting	 and	 amplifying 	 what	 is
perceived.	 Rather,	 it	 is	 a	 neutral	 mode	 that	 maintain s	 self-
reflectiveness	even	amidst	turbulent	emotions.	Willia m	Styron	seems
to	be	describing	something	like	this	faculty	of	mind	 in	writing	of	his
deep	depression,	telling	of	a	sense	“of	being	accomp anied	by	a	second
self—a	 wraithlike	 observer	 who,	 not	 sharing	 the	 demen tia	 of	 his
double,	is	able	to	watch	with	dispassionate	curiosi ty	as	his	companion
struggles.” 4
At	 its	 best,	 self-observation	 allows	 just	 such	 an	 e quanimous
awareness	 of	 passionate	 or	 turbulent	 feelings.	 At	 a 	 minimum,	 it
manifests	 itself	 simply	 as	 a	 slight	 stepping-back	 fro m	 experience,	 a
parallel	 stream	 of	 consciousness	 that	 is	 “meta”:	 hove ring	 above	 or
beside	the	main	flow,	aware	of	what	is	happening	rat her	than	being
immersed	 and	 lost	 in	 it.	 It	 is	 the	 difference	 between ,	 for	 example,
being	murderously	enraged	at	someone	and	having	the	s elf-reflexive
thought	“This	is	anger	I’m	feeling”	even	as	you	are	 enraged.	In	terms
of	 the	 neural	 mechanics	 of	 awareness,	 this	 subtle	 sh ift	 in	 mental
activity	 presumably	 signals	 that	 neocortical	 circuit s	 are	 actively
monitoring	 the	 emotion,	 a	 first	 step	 in	 gaining	 some	 c ontrol.	 This
awareness	of	emotions	is	the	fundamental	emotional	comp etence	on
which	others,	such	as	emotional	self-control,	build.
Self-awareness,	in	short,	means	being	“aware	of	both 	our	mood	and
our	 thoughts	 about	 that	 mood,”	 in	 the	 words	 of	 John	 Mayer,	 a
University	 of	 New	 Hampshire	 psychologist	 who,	 with	 Ya le’s	 Peter
Salovey,	 is	 a	 coformulator	 of	 the	 theory	 of	 emotional 	 intelligence. 5
Self-awareness	can	be	a	nonreactive,	nonjudgmental	a ttention	to	inner
states.	 But	 Mayer	 finds	 that	 this	 sensibility	 also	 can	 be	 less
equanimous;	 typical	 thoughts	 bespeaking	 emotional	 sel f-awareness
include	“I	shouldn’t	feel	this	way,”	“I’m	thinking	g ood	things	to	cheer
up,”	 and,	 for	 a	 more	 restricted	 self-awareness,	 the	 fleeting	 thought
“Don’t	think	about	it”	in	reaction	to	something	highly	upsett ing.
Although	 there	 is	 a	 logical	 distinction	 between	 bei ng	 aware	 of
feelings	and	acting	to	change	them,	Mayer	finds	that 	for	all	practical
purposes	the	two	usually	go	hand-in-hand:	to	recogn ize	a	foul	mood	is
to	want	to	get	out	of	it.	This	recognition,	however ,	is	distinct	from	the
efforts	we	make	to	keep	from	acting	on	an	emotional	imp ulse.	When
======================================== [Página 67] ========================================

we	 say	 “Stop	 that!”	 to	 a	 child	 whose	 anger	 has	 led	 him	 to	 hit	 a
playmate,	we	may	stop	the	hitting,	but	the	anger	stil l	simmers.	The
child’s	thoughts	are	still	fixated	on	the	trigger	f or	the	anger—“But	he
stole	my	toy!”—and	the	anger	continues	unabated.	Self -awareness	has
a	 more	 powerful	 effect	 on	 strong,	 aversive	 feelings: 	 the	 realization
“This	is	anger	I’m	feeling”	offers	a	greater	degree	 of	freedom—not	just
the	option	not	to	act	on	it,	but	the	added	option	to	try	to	let	go 	of	it.
Mayer	 finds	 that	 people	 tend	 to	 fall	 into	 distincti ve	 styles	 for
attending	to	and	dealing	with	their	emotions: 6
•	Self-aware .	Aware	of	their	moods	as	they	are	having	them,	these
people	 understandably	 have	 some	 sophistication	 about 	 their
emotional	 lives.	 Their	 clarity	 about	 emotions	 may	 unde rgird	 other
personality	 traits:	 they	 are	 autonomous	 and	 sure	 of	 their	 own
boundaries,	 are	 in	 good	 psychological	 health,	 and	 t end	 to	 have	 a
positive	outlook	on	life.	When	they	get	into	a	bad	 mood,	they	don’t
ruminate	and	obsess	about	it,	and	are	able	to	get	ou t	of	it	sooner.	In
short,	their	mindfulness	helps	them	manage	their	emotions.
•	Engulfed .	 These	 are	 people	 who	 often	 feel	 swamped	 by	 their
emotions	 and	 helpless	 to	 escape	 them,	 as	 though	 their 	 moods	 have
taken	charge.	They	are	mercurial	and	not	very	aware	 of	their	feelings,
so	that	they	are	lost	in	them	rather	than	having	some 	perspective.	As
a	result,	they	do	little	to	try	to	escape	bad	moods, 	feeling	that	they
have	 no	 control	 over	 their	 emotional	 life.	 They	 ofte n	 feel
overwhelmed	and	emotionally	out	of	control.
•	Accepting .	While	these	people	are	often	clear	about	what	the y	are
feeling,	they	also	tend	to	be	accepting	of	their	moo ds,	and	so	don’t	try
to	change	them.	There	seem	to	be	two	branches	of	the	 accepting	type:
those	who	are	usually	in	good	moods	and	so	have	litt le	motivation	to
change	them,	and	people	who,	despite	their	clarity	a bout	their	moods,
are	 susceptible	 to	 bad	 ones	 but	 accept	 them	 with	 a	 l aissez-faire
attitude,	 doing	 nothing	 to	 change	 them	 despite	 their 	 distress—a
pattern	found	among,	say,	depressed	people	who	are	r esigned	to	their
despair.
THE	PASSIONATE	AND	THE	INDIFFERENT
Imagine	 for	 a	 moment	 that	 you’re	 on	 an	 airplane	 flying 	 from	 New
York	to	San	Francisco.	It’s	been	a	smooth	flight,	bu t	as	you	approach
======================================== [Página 68] ========================================

the	Rockies	the	pilot’s	voice	comes	over	the	plane	i ntercom.	“Ladies
and	gentlemen,	there’s	some	turbulence	ahead.	Please	 return	to	your
seats	 and	 fasten	 your	 seatbelts.”	 And	 then	 the	 plan e	 hits	 the
turbulence,	which	is	rougher	than	you’ve	ever	endur ed—the	airplane
is	tossed	up	and	down	and	side	to	side	like	a	beach	ball	in	the	wa ves.
The	question	is,	what	do	you	do?	Are	you	the	kind	o f	person	who
buries	yourself	in	your	book	or	magazine,	or	continu es	watching	the
movie,	tuning	out	the	turbulence?	Or	are	you	likely	 to	take	out	the
emergency	 card	 and	 review	 the	 precautions,	 or	 watch	 the	 flight
attendants	 to	 see	 if	 they	 show	 signs	 of	 panic,	 or	 s train	 to	 hear	 the
engines	to	see	if	there’s	anything	worrisome?
Which	of	these	responses	comes	more	naturally	to	us	i s	a	sign	of	our
favored	attentional	stance	under	duress.	The	airpla ne	scenario	itself	is
an	 item	 from	 a	 psychological	 test	 developed	 by	 Suzann e	 Miller,	 a
psychologist	at	Temple	University,	to	assess	whether	people 	tend	to	be
vigilant,	 attending	 carefully	 to	 every	 detail	 of	 a	 distressing
predicament,	 or,	 in	 contrast,	 deal	 with	 such	 anxious 	 moments	 by
trying	 to	 distract	 themselves.	 These	 two	 attentional 	 stances	 toward
distress	have	very	different	consequences	for	how	p eople	experience
their	own	emotional	reactions.	Those	who	tune	in	und er	duress	can,
by	 the	 very	 act	 of	 attending	 so	 carefully,	 unwittin gly	 amplify	 the
magnitude	 of	 their	 own	 reactions—especially	 if	 their	 tuning	 in	 is
devoid	 of	 the	 equanimity	 of	 self-awareness.	 The	 resu lt	 is	 that	 their
emotions	seem	all	the	more	intense.	Those	who	tune	out ,	who	distract
themselves,	notice	less	about	their	own	reactions,	a nd	so	minimize	the
experience	of	their	emotional	response,	if	not	the	s ize	of	the	response
itself.
At	 the	 extremes,	 this	 means	 that	 for	 some	 people	 emotio nal
awareness	is	overwhelming,	while	for	others	it	barel y	exists.	Consider
the	college	student	who,	one	evening,	spotted	a	fir e	that	had	broken
out	in	his	dorm,	went	to	get	a	fire	extinguisher,	an d	put	the	fire	out.
Nothing	unusual—except	that	on	his	way	to	get	the	ex tinguisher	and
then	on	the	way	back	to	the	fire,	he	walked	instead 	of	running.	The
reason?	He	didn’t	feel	there	was	any	urgency.
This	story	was	told	to	me	by	Edward	Diener,	a	Univer sity	of	Illinois
at	 Urbana	 psychologist	 who	 has	 been	 studying	 the	 intensity 	 with
which	 people	 experience	 their	 emotions. 7	 The	 college	 student	 stood
out	in	his	collection	of	case	studies	as	one	of	the 	least	intense	Diener
had	 ever	 encountered.	 He	 was,	 essentially,	 a	 man	 with out	 passions,
someone	who	goes	through	life	feeling	little	or	noth ing,	even	about	an
======================================== [Página 69] ========================================

emergency	like	a	fire.
By	 contrast,	 consider	 a	 woman	 at	 the	 opposite	 end	 of 	 Diener’s
spectrum.	When	she	once	lost	her	favorite	pen,	she	w as	distraught	for
days.	Another	time	she	was	so	thrilled	on	seeing	an	 ad	for	a	big	sale
on	 women’s	 shoes	 at	 an	 expensive	 store	 that	 she	 drop ped	 what	 she
was	doing,	hopped	in	her	car,	and	drove	three	hours 	to	the	store	in
Chicago.
Diener	finds	that	women,	in	general,	feel	both	posit ive	and	negative
emotions	 more	 strongly	 than	 do	 men.	 And,	 sex	 differenc es	 aside,
emotional	life	is	richer	for	those	who	notice	more.	F or	one	thing,	this
enhanced	 emotional	 sensitivity	 means	 that	 for	 such	 pe ople	 the	 least
provocation	unleashes	emotional	storms,	whether	heave nly	or	hellish,
while	those	at	the	other	extreme	barely	experience	a ny	feeling	even
under	the	most	dire	circumstances.
THE	MAN	WITHOUT	FEELINGS
Gary	 infuriated	 his	 fiancée,	 Ellen,	 because	 even	 th ough	 he	 was
intelligent,	 thoughtful,	 and	 a	 successful	 surgeon,	 Gary	 was
emotionally	 flat,	 completely	 unresponsive	 to	 any	 and	 all	 shows	 of
feeling.	While	Gary	could	speak	brilliantly	of	scie nce	and	art,	when	it
came	to	his	feelings—even	for	Ellen—he	fell	silent.	Tr y	as	she	might
to	 elicit	 some	 passion	 from	 him,	 Gary	 was	 impassive,	 ob livious.	 “I
don’t	naturally	express	my	feelings,”	Gary	told	the	 therapist	he	saw	at
Ellen’s	insistence.	When	it	came	to	emotional	life,	h e	added,	“I	don’t
know	what	to	talk	about;	I	have	no	strong	feelings, 	either	positive	or
negative.”
Ellen	was	not	 alone	in	being	 frustrated	by	Gary’s	 a loofness;	as	he
confided	 to	 his	 therapist,	 he	 was	 unable	 to	 speak	 o penly	 about	 his
feelings	with	anyone	in	his	life.	The	reason:	He	did 	not	know	what	he
felt	 in	 the	 first	 place.	 So	 far	 as	 he	 could	 tell,	 h e	 had	 no	 angers,	 no
sadnesses,	no	joys. 8
As	his	own	therapist	observes,	this	emotional	blankn ess	makes	Gary
and	 others	 like	 him	 colorless,	 bland:	 “They	 bore	 eve rybody.	 That’s
why	their	wives	send	them	into	treatment.”	Gary’s	emot ional	flatness
exemplifies	 what	 psychiatrists	 call	 alexithymia ,	 from	 the	 Greek	 a-for
“lack,”	lexis	for 	 “word,”	 and	thymos	for 	 “emotion.”	 Such	 people	 lack
words	for	their	feelings.	Indeed,	they	seem	to	lack	 feelings	altogether,
although	 this	 may	 actually	 be	 because	 of	 their	 inabi lity	 to	express
======================================== [Página 70] ========================================

emotion	 rather	 than	 from	 an	 absence	 of	 emotion	 altoget her.	 Such
people	 were	 first	 noticed	 by	 psychoanalysts	 puzzled 	 by	 a	 class	 of
patients	who	were	untreatable	by	that	method	because 	they	reported
no	 feelings,	 no	 fantasies,	 and	 colorless	 dreams—in	 sh ort,	 no	 inner
emotional	 life	 to	 talk	 about	 at	 all. 9	 The	 clinical	 features	 that	 mark
alexithymics	include	having	difficulty	describing	fe elings—their	own
or	 anyone	 else’s—and	 a	 sharply	 limited	 emotional	 vocab ulary. 10
What’s	 more,	 they	 have	 trouble	 discriminating	 among	 emo tions	 as
well	as	between	emotion	and	bodily	sensation,	so	tha t	they	might	tell
of	 having	 butterflies	 in	 the	 stomach,	 palpitations,	 sweating,	 and
dizziness—but	they	would	not	know	they	are	feeling	anxious.
“They	 give	 the	 impression	 of	 being	 different,	 alien	 beings,	 having
come	from	an	entirely	different	world,	living	in	the	 midst	of	a	society
which	is	dominated	by	feelings,”	is	the	description	 given	by	Dr.	Peter
Sifneos,	 the	 Harvard	 psychiatrist	 who	 in	 1972	 coined 	 the	 term
alexithymia .11	 Alexithymics	 rarely	 cry,	 for	 example,	 but	 if	 they	 do
their	 tears	 are	 copious.	 Still,	 they	 are	 bewildered 	 if	 asked	 what	 the
tears	are	all	 about.	One	patient	 with	alexithymia	wa s	 so	upset	 after
seeing	a	movie	about	a	woman	with	eight	children	who	 was	dying	of
cancer	 that	 she	 cried	 herself	 to	 sleep.	 When	 her	 th erapist	 suggested
that	 perhaps	 she	 was	 upset	 because	 the	 movie	 reminded 	 her	 of	 her
own	 mother,	 who	 was	 in	 actuality	 dying	 of	 cancer,	 th e	 woman	 sat
motionless,	bewildered	and	silent.	When	her	therapis t	then	asked	her
how	she	felt	at	that	moment,	she	said	she	felt	“awful ,”	but	couldn’t
clarify	 her	 feelings	 beyond	 that.	 And,	 she	 added,	 f rom	 time	 to	 time
she	found	herself	crying,	but	never	knew	exactly	wh at	she	was	crying
about. 12
And	that	is	the	nub	of	the	problem.	It	is	not	that	a lexithymics	never
feel,	but	that	they	are	unable	to	know—and	especiall y	unable	to	put
into	words—precisely	what	their	feelings	are.	They	a re	utterly	lacking
in	 the	 fundamental	 skill	 of	 emotional	 intelligence,	 s elf-awareness—
knowing	what	we	are	feeling	as	emotions	roil	within	 us.	Alexithymics
belie	 the	 common-sense	 notion	 that	 it	 is	 perfectly	 se lf-evident	 what
we	are	feeling:	they	haven’t	a	clue.	When	something—o r	more	likely,
someone—does	 move	 them	 to	 feeling,	 they	 find	 the	 experi ence
baffling	and	overwhelming,	something	to	avoid	at	all	 costs.	Feelings
come	 to	 them,	 when	 they	 come	 at	 all,	 as	 a	 befuddling	 b undle	 of
distress;	 as	 the	 patient	 who	 cried	 at	 the	 movie	 put	 it,	 they	 feel
“awful,”	but	can’t	say	exactly	which	 kind	of	awful	it	is	they	feel.
This	 basic	 confusion	 about	 feelings	 often	 seems	 to	 l ead	 them	 to
======================================== [Página 71] ========================================

complain	 of	 vague	 medical	 problems	 when	 they	 are	 actua lly
experiencing	emotional	distress—a	phenomenon	known	in	 psychiatry
as	somaticizing ,	mistaking	an	emotional	ache	for	a	physical	one	(and
different	from	a	psychosomatic	disease,	in	which	emoti onal	problems
cause	genuine	medical	ones).	Indeed,	much	of	the	psyc hiatric	interest
in	alexithymics	is	in	weeding	them	out	from	among	those 	who	come
to	doctors	seeking	help,	for	they	are	prone	to	leng thy—and	fruitless—
pursuit	of	a	medical	diagnosis	and	treatment	for	what 	is	actually	an
emotional	problem.
While	no	one	can	as	yet	say	for	sure	what	causes	al exithymia,	Dr.
Sifneos	proposes	a	disconnection	between	the	limbic	 system	and	the
neocortex,	particularly	its	verbal	centers,	which	fits	wel l	with	what	we
are	learning	about	the	emotional	brain.	Patients	wit h	severe	seizures
who	had	that	connection	surgically	severed	to	relie ve	their	symptoms,
notes	Sifneos,	became	emotionally	flat,	like	people	w ith	alexithymia,
unable	to	put	their	feelings	into	words	and	suddenl y	devoid	of	fantasy
life.	 In	 short,	 though	 the	 circuits	 of	 the	 emotional 	 brain	 may	 react
with	feelings,	the	neocortex	is	not	able	to	sort	ou t	these	feelings	and
add	the	nuance	of	language	to	them.	As	Henry	Roth	obs erved	in	his
novel	Call	It	Sleep 	 about	 this	 power	 of	 language,	 “If	 you	 could	 put
words	to	what	you	felt,	it	was	yours.”	The	corollar y,	of	course,	is	the
alexithymic’s	 dilemma:	 having	 no	 words	 for	 feelings	 mea ns	 not
making	the	feelings	your	own.
IN	PRAISE	OF	GUT	FEELING
Elliot’s	 tumor,	 growing	 just	 behind	 his	 forehead,	 wa s	 the	 size	 of	 a
small	 orange;	 surgery	 removed	 it	 completely.	 Although	 the	 surgery
was	declared	a	success,	afterward	people	who	knew	h im	well	said	that
Elliot	 was	 no	 longer	 Elliot—he	 had	 undergone	 a	 drast ic	 personality
change.	 Once	 a	 successful	 corporate	 lawyer,	 Elliot	 could	 no	 longer
hold	 a	 job.	 His	 wife	 left	 him.	 Squandering	 his	 saving s	 in	 fruitless
investments,	 he	 was	 reduced	 to	 living	 in	 a	 spare	 bed room	 at	 his
brother’s	home.
There	 was	 a	 puzzling	 pattern	 to	 Elliot’s	 problem.	 In tellectually	 he
was	 as	 bright	 as	 ever,	 but	 he	 used	 his	 time	 terribly ,	 getting	 lost	 in
minor	details;	he	seemed	to	have	lost	all	sense	of	pr iority.	Reprimands
made	 no	 difference;	 he	 was	 fired	 from	 a	 succession	 of 	 legal	 jobs.
Though	extensive	intellectual	tests	found	nothing	w rong	with	Elliot’s
======================================== [Página 72] ========================================

mental	 faculties,	 he	 went	 to	 see	 a	 neurologist	 anywa y,	 hoping	 that
discovery	 of	 a	 neurological	 problem	 might	 get	 him	 the	 disability
benefits	 to	 which	 he	 felt	 he	 was	 entitled.	 Otherwis e	 the	 conclusion
seemed	to	be	that	he	was	just	a	malingerer.
Antonio	 Damasio,	 the	 neurologist	 Elliot	 consulted,	 w as	 struck	 by
one	 element	 missing	 from	 Elliot’s	 mental	 repertoire:	 th ough	 nothing
was	wrong	with	his	logic,	memory,	attention,	or	any	o ther	cognitive
ability,	 Elliot	 was	 virtually	 oblivious	 to	 his	 feel ings	 about	 what	 had
happened	 to	 him. 13	 Most	 strikingly,	 Elliot	 could	 narrate	 the	 tragic
events	 of	 his	 life	 with	 complete	 dispassion,	 as	 thou gh	 he	 were	 an
onlooker	 to	 the	 losses	 and	 failures	 of	 his	 past—with out	 a	 note	 of
regret	 or	 sadness,	 frustration	 or	 anger	 at	 life’s	 u nfairness.	 His	 own
tragedy	brought	him	no	pain;	Damasio	felt	more	upset	by	Elliot’s 	story
than	did	Elliot	himself.
The	source	of	this	emotional	unawareness,	Damasio	con cluded,	was
the	removal,	along	with	the	brain	tumor,	of	part	of	E lliot’s	prefrontal
lobes.	 In	 effect,	 the	 surgery	 had	 severed	 ties	 betw een	 the	 lower
centers	 of	 the	 emotional	 brain,	 especially	 the	 amygda la	 and	 related
circuits,	 and	 the	 thinking	 abilities	 of	 the	 neocort ex.	 Elliot’s	 thinking
had	become	computerlike,	able	to	make	every	step	in	th e	calculus	of	a
decision,	 but	 unable	 to	 assign	 values 	 to	 differing	 possibilities.	 Every
option	 was	 neutral.	 And	 that	 overly	 dispassionate	 r easoning,
suspected	 Damasio,	 was	 the	 core	 of	 Elliot’s	 problem:	 too	 little
awareness	 of	 his	 own	 feelings	 about	 things	 made	 Elli ot’s	 reasoning
faulty.
The	 handicap	 showed	 up	 even	 in	 mundane	 decisions.	 Wh en
Damasio	 tried	 to	 choose	 a	 time	 and	 date	 for	 the	 next	 appointment
with	Elliot,	the	result	was	a	muddle	of	indecisivene ss:	Elliot	could	find
arguments	 for	 and	 against	 every	 date	 and	 time	 that	 Da masio
proposed,	 but	 could	 not	 choose	 among	 them.	 At	 the	 rat ional	 level,
there	 were	 perfectly	 good	 reasons	 for	 objecting	 to	 or	 accepting
virtually	 every	 possible	 time	 for	 the	 appointment.	 Bu t	 Elliot	 lacked
any	 sense	 of	 how	 he	felt 	 about	 any	 of	 the	 times.	 Lacking	 that
awareness	of	his	own	feelings,	he	had	no	preferences	at	all.
One	lesson	from	Elliot’s	indecisiveness	is	the	cruci al	role	of	feeling
in	 navigating	 the	 endless	 stream	 of	 life’s	 personal	 decisions.	 While
strong	feelings	can	create	havoc	in	reasoning,	the	 lack	of	awareness	of
feeling	 can	 also	 be	 ruinous,	 especially	 in	 weighing 	 the	 decisions	 on
which	our	destiny	largely	depends:	what	career	to	p ursue,	whether	to
stay	 with	 a	 secure	 job	 or	 switch	 to	 one	 that	 is	 ris kier	 but	 more
======================================== [Página 73] ========================================

interesting,	whom	to	date	or	marry,	where	to	live,	wh ich	apartment	to
rent	 or	 house	 to	 buy—and	 on	 and	 on	 through	 life.	 Suc h	 decisions
cannot	 be	 made	 well	 through	 sheer	 rationality;	 they	 require	 gut
feeling,	and	the	emotional	wisdom	garnered	through	pa st	experiences.
Formal	logic	alone	can	never	work	as	the	basis	for	d eciding	whom	to
marry	or	trust	or	even	what	job	to	take;	these	are	realms	where	re ason
without	feeling	is	blind.
The	 intuitive	 signals	 that	 guide	 us	 in	 these	 moments	 come	 in	 the
form	 of	 limbic-driven	 surges	 from	 the	 viscera	 that	 Dama sio	 calls
“somatic	 markers”—literally,	 gut	 feelings.	 The	 somatic	 marker	 is	 a
kind	 of	 automatic	 alarm,	 typically	 calling	 attention	 to	 a	 potential
danger	 from	 a	 given	 course	 of	 action.	 More	 often	 tha n	 not	 these
markers	 steer	 us	 away 	 from	 some	 choice	 that	 experience	 warns	 us
against,	 though	 they	 can	 also	 alert	 us	 to	 a	 golden	 opportunity.	 We
usually	 do	 not,	 at	 that	 moment,	 recall	 what	 specific	 experiences
formed	 this	 negative	 feeling;	 all	 we	 need	 is	 the	 sig nal	 that	 a	 given
potential	course	of	action	could	be	disastrous.	Whe never	such	a	gut
feeling	 rises	 up,	 we	 can	 immediately	 drop	 or	 pursue	 t hat	 avenue	 of
consideration	with	greater	confidence,	and	so	pare	 down	our	array	of
choices	 to	 a	 more	 manageable	 decision	 matrix.	 The	 key	 to	 sounder
personal	decision-making,	in	short:	being	attuned	to	our	fee lings.
PLUMBING	THE	UNCONSCIOUS
Elliot’s	 emotional	 vacuity	 suggests	 that	 there	 may	 be 	 a	 spectrum	 of
people’s	 ability	 to	 sense	 their	 emotions	 as	 they	 hav e	 them.	 By	 the
logic	 of	 neuroscience,	 if	 the	 absence	 of	 a	 neural	 c ircuit	 leads	 to	 a
deficit	 in	 an	 ability,	 then	 the	 relative	 strength	 o r	 weakness	 of	 that
same	 circuit	 in	 people	 whose	 brains	 are	 intact	 shoul d	 lead	 to
comparable	levels	of	competence	in	that	same	ability.	 In	terms	of	the
role	of	prefrontal	circuits	in	emotional	attunement,	 this	suggests	that
for	 neurological	 reasons	 some	 of	 us	 may	 more	 easily	 de tect	 the
stirring	of	fear	or	joy	than	do	others,	and	so	be	mo re	emotionally	self-
aware.
It	may	be	that	a	talent	for	psychological	introspect ion	hinges	on	this
same	 circuitry.	 Some	 of	 us	 are	 naturally	 more	 attuned	 to	 the
emotional	mind’s	special	symbolic	modes:	metaphor	and	si mile,	along
with	poetry,	song,	and	fable,	are	all	cast	in	the	l anguage	of	the	heart.
So	too	are	dreams	and	myths,	in	which	loose	associati ons	determine
======================================== [Página 74] ========================================

the	 flow	 of	 narrative,	 abiding	 by	 the	 logic	 of	 the	 emotional	 mind.
Those	who	have	a	natural	attunement	to	their	own	hea rt’s	voice—the
language	 of	 emotion—are	 sure	 to	 be	 more	 adept	 at	 artic ulating	 its
messages,	whether	as	a	novelist,	songwriter,	or	psyc hotherapist.	This
inner	attunement	should	make	them	more	gifted	in	giving 	voice	to	the
“wisdom	 of	 the	 unconscious”—the	 felt	 meanings	 of	 our	 d reams	 and
fantasies,	the	symbols	that	embody	our	deepest	wishes.
Self-awareness	 is	 fundamental	 to	 psychological	 insig ht;	 this	 is	 the
faculty	 that	 much	 of	 psychotherapy	 means	 to	 strengthe n.	 Indeed,
Howard	 Gardner’s	 model	 for	 intrapsychic	 intelligence	 is	 Sigmund
Freud,	 the	 great	 mapper	 of	 the	 psyche’s	 secret	 dynami cs.	 As	 Freud
made	clear,	much	of	emotional	life	is	unconscious;	fee lings	that	stir
within	us	do	not	always	cross	the	threshold	into	aw areness.	Empirical
verification	 of	 this	 psychological	 axiom	 comes,	 for	 i nstance,	 from
experiments	on	unconscious	emotions,	such	as	the	remar kable	finding
that	people	form	definite	likings	for	things	they	do 	not	even	realize
they	 have	 seen	 before.	 Any	 emotion	 can	 be—and	 often	 i s—
unconscious.
The	physiological	beginnings	of	an	emotion	typically 	occur	before	a
person	is	consciously	aware	of	the	feeling	itself.	 For	example,	when
people	who	fear	snakes	are	shown	pictures	of	snakes ,	sensors	on	their
skin	will	detect	sweat	breaking	out,	a	sign	of	anxi ety,	though	they	say
they	 do	 not	 feel	 any	 fear.	 The	 sweat	 shows	 up	 in	 su ch	 people	 even
when	the	picture	of	a	snake	is	presented	so	rapidly 	that	they	have	no
conscious	idea	of	what,	exactly,	they	just	saw,	let 	alone	that	they	are
beginning	 to	 get	 anxious.	 As	 such	 preconscious	 emoti onal	 stirrings
continue	to	build,	they	eventually	become	strong	enough	to	br eak	into
awareness.	 Thus	 there	 are	 two	 levels	 of	 emotion,	 con scious	 and
unconscious.	 The	 moment	 of	 an	 emotion	 coming	 into	 aware ness
marks	its	registering	as	such	in	the	frontal	cortex. 14
Emotions	that	simmer	beneath	the	threshold	of	awarenes s	can	have
a	 powerful	 impact	 on	 how	 we	 perceive	 and	 react,	 even 	 though	 we
have	no	idea	they	are	at	work.	Take	someone	who	is	a nnoyed	by	a
rude	 encounter	 early	 in	 the	 day,	 and	 then	 is	 peevis h	 for	 hours
afterward,	 taking	 affront	 where	 none	 is	 intended	 an d	 snapping	 at
people	for	no	real	reason.	He	may	well	be	oblivious	t o	his	continuing
irritability	 and	 will	 be	 surprised	 if	 someone	 calls	 attention	 to	 it,
though	it	stews	just	out	of	his	awareness	and	dicta tes	his	curt	replies.
But	once	that	reaction	is	brought	into	awareness—onc e	it	registers	in
the	 cortex—he	 can	 evaluate	 things	 anew,	 decide	 to	 sh rug	 off	 the
======================================== [Página 75] ========================================

feelings	left	earlier	in	the	day,	and	change	his	ou tlook	and	mood.	In
this	 way	 emotional	 self-awareness	 is	 the	 building	 bl ock	 of	 the	 next
fundamental	of	emotional	intelligence:	being	able	to	 shake	off	a	bad
mood.

Passion’s	Slaves
Thou	hast	been	…
A	man	that	Fortune’s	buffets	and	rewards
Has	taken	with	equal	thanks 	…	.	Give	me	that	man
That	is	not	passion’s	slave,	and	I	will	wear	him
In	my	heart’s	core,	aye,	in	my	heart	of	hearts
As	I	do	thee .…
—H AMLET	TO	HIS	FRIEND 	HORATIO
A	 sense	 of	 self-mastery,	 of	 being	 able	 to	 withstand	 the	 emotional
storms	 that	 the	 buffeting	 of	 Fortune	 brings	 rather	 t han	 being
“passion’s	slave,”	has	been	praised	as	a	virtue	sin ce	the	time	of	Plato.
The	ancient	Greek	word	for	it	was	 sophrosyne ,	“care	and	intelligence
in	 conducting	 one’s	 life;	 a	 tempered	 balance	 and	 wis dom,”	 as	 Page
DuBois,	 a	 Greek	 scholar,	 translates	 it.	 The	 Romans	 a nd	 the	 early
Christian	church	called	it	 temperantia ,	temperance,	the	restraining	of
emotional	 excess.	 The	 goal	 is	 balance,	 not	 emotional	 suppression:
every	 feeling	 has	 its	 value	 and	 significance.	 A	 lif e	 without	 passion
would	be	a	dull	wasteland	of	neutrality,	cut	off	an d	isolated	from	the
richness	 of	 life	 itself.	 But,	 as	 Aristotle	 observed ,	 what	 is	 wanted	 is
appropriate 	 emotion,	 feeling	 proportionate	 to	 circumstance.	 When
emotions	are	too	muted	they	create	dullness	and	dista nce;	when	out
of	control,	too	extreme	and	persistent,	they	become	p athological,	as	in
immobilizing	depression,	overwhelming	anxiety,	raging	 anger,	manic
agitation.
Indeed,	 keeping	 our	 distressing	 emotions	 in	 check	 is 	 the	 key	 to
emotional	 well-being;	 extremes—emotions	 that	 wax	 too	 in tensely	 or
for	 too	 long-undermine	 our	 stability.	 Of	 course,	 it	 is	 not	 that	 we
should	 feel	 only	 one	 kind	 of	 emotion;	 being	 happy	 al l	 the	 time
somehow	suggests	the	blandness	of	those	smiley-face	b adges	that	had
a	 faddish	 moment	 in	 the	 1970s.	 There	 is	 much	 to	 be	 sai d	 for	 the
constructive	 contribution	 of	 suffering	 to	 creative	 and	 spiritual	 life;
suffering	can	temper	the	soul.

Downs	as	well	as	ups	spice	life,	but	need	to	be	in	 balance.	In	the
calculus	 of	 the	 heart	 it	 is	 the	 ratio	 of	 positive	 t o	 negative	 emotions
that	 determines	 the	 sense	 of	 well-being—at	 least	 that 	 is	 the	 verdict
from	 studies	 of	 mood	 in	 which	 hundreds	 of	 men	 and	 women 	 have
carried	beepers	that	reminded	them	at	random	times	to	r ecord	their
emotions	 at	 that	 moment. 1	 It	 is	 not	 that	 people	 need	 to	 avoid
unpleasant	feelings	to	feel	content,	but	rather	tha t	stormy	feelings	not
go	unchecked,	displacing	all	pleasant	moods.	People	 who	have	strong
episodes	of	anger	or	depression	can	still	feel	a	se nse	of	well-being	if
they	have	a	countervailing	set	of	equally	joyous	or 	happy	times.	These
studies	 also	 affirm	 the	 independence	 of	 emotional	 fro m	 academic
intelligence,	finding	little	or	no	relationship	bet ween	grades	or	IQ	and
people’s	emotional	well-being.
Just	 as	 there	 is	 a	 steady	 murmur	 of	 background	 though ts	 in	 the
mind,	there	is	a	constant	emotional	hum;	beep	someone	a t	six	 A.M.	or
seven	 P.M.	and	he	will	always	be	in	some	mood	or	other.	Of	cou rse,	on
any	two	mornings	someone	can	have	very	different	moods ;	but	when
people’s	 moods	 are	 averaged	 over	 weeks	 or	 months,	 the y	 tend	 to
reflect	that	person’s	overall	sense	of	well-being.	 It	turns	out	that	for
most	people,	extremely	intense	feelings	are	relativel y	rare;	most	of	us
fall	 into	 the	 gray	 middle	 range,	 with	 mild	 bumps	 in	 ou r	 emotional
roller	coaster.
Still,	managing	our	emotions	is	something	of	a	full-ti me	job:	much
of	what	we	do—especially	in	our	free	time—is	an	attempt 	to	manage
mood.	Everything	from	reading	a	novel	or	watching	tel evision	to	the
activities	and	companions	we	choose	can	be	a	way	to	 make	ourselves
feel	 better.	 The	 art	 of	 soothing	 ourselves	 is	 a	 fun damental	 life	 skill;
some	 psychoanalytic	 thinkers,	 such	 as	 John	 Bowlby	 an d	 D.	 W.
Winnicott,	 see	 this	 as	 one	 of	 the	 most	 essential	 of	 all	 psychic	 tools.
The	 theory	 holds	 that	 emotionally	 sound	 infants	 lear n	 to	 soothe
themselves	 by	 treating	 themselves	 as	 their	 caretakers 	 have	 treated
them,	leaving	them	less	vulnerable	to	the	upheavals	o f	the	emotional
brain.
As	we	have	seen,	the	design	of	the	brain	means	that	 we	very	often
have	little	or	no	control	over	 when 	we	are	swept	by	emotion,	nor	over
what	 emotion	 it	 will	 be.	 But	 we	 can	 have	 some	 say	 in	 how	long 	 an
emotion	 will	 last.	 The	 issue	 arises	 not	 with	 garden- variety	 sadness,
worry,	or	anger;	normally	such	moods	pass	with	time	an d	patience.
But	 when	 these	 emotions	 are	 of	 great	 intensity	 and	 l inger	 past	 an
======================================== [Página 78] ========================================

appropriate	 point,	 they	 shade	 over	 into	 their	 distr essing	 extremes—
chronic	 anxiety,	 uncontrollable	 rage,	 depression.	 A nd,	 at	 their	 most
severe	 and	 intractable,	 medication,	 psychotherapy,	 o r	 both	 may	 be
needed	to	lift	them.
In	these	times,	one	sign	of	the	capacity	for	emotiona l	self-regulation
may	be	recognizing	when	chronic	agitation	of	the	emot ional	brain	is
too	strong	to	be	overcome	without	pharmacologic	help. 	For	example,
two	thirds	of	those	who	suffer	from	manic-depression	 have	never	been
treated	for	the	disorder.	But	lithium	or	newer	medica tions	can	thwart
the	 characteristic	 cycle	 of	 paralyzing	 depression	 a lternating	 with
manic	episodes	that	mix	chaotic	elation	and	grandiosity	with	i rritation
and	rage.	One	problem	with	manic-depression	is	that	w hile	people	are
in	the	throes	of	mania	they	often	feel	so	overly	con fident	that	they	see
no	need	for	help	of	any	kind	despite	the	disastrous 	decisions	they	are
making.	 In	 such	 severe	 emotional	 disorders	 psychiatri c	 medication
offers	a	tool	for	managing	life	better.
But	 when	 it	 comes	 to	 vanquishing	 the	 more	 usual	 range 	 of	 bad
moods,	we	are	left	to	our	own	devices.	Unfortunately ,	those	devices
are	 not	 always	 effective—at	 least	 such	 is	 the	 conclu sion	 reached	 by
Diane	 Tice,	 a	 psychologist	 at	 Case	 Western	 Reserve	 University,	 who
asked	more	than	four	hundred	men	and	women	about	the	s trategies
they	used	to	escape	foul	moods,	and	how	successful	t hose	tactics	were
for	them. 2
Not	everyone	agrees	with	the	philosophical	premise	t hat	bad	moods
should	 be	 changed;	 there	 are,	 Tice	 found,	 “mood	 puri sts,”	 the	 5
percent	 or	 so	 of	 people	 who	 said	 they	 never	 try	 to	 change	 a	 mood
since,	 in	 their	 view,	 all	 emotions	 are	 “natural”	 and 	 should	 be
experienced	 just	 as	 they	 present	 themselves,	 no	 matte r	 how
dispiriting.	 And	 then	 there	 were	 those	 who	 regularl y	 sought	 to	 get
into	unpleasant	moods	for	pragmatic	reasons:	physicia ns	who	needed
to	be	somber	to	give	patients	bad	news;	social	activ ists	who	nurtured
their	outrage	at	injustice	so	as	to	be	more	effectiv e	in	battling	it;	even
a	 young	 man	 who	 told	 of	 working	 up	 his	 anger	 to	 help 	 his	 little
brother	 with	 playground	 bullies.	 And	 some	 people	 wer e	 positively
Machiavellian	about	manipulating	moods—witness	the	bil l	collectors
who	purposely	worked	themselves	into	a	rage	in	orde r	to	be	all	the
firmer	 with	 deadbeats. 3	 But	 these	 rare	 purposive	 cultivations	 of
unpleasantness	 aside,	 most	 everyone	 complained	 of	 bei ng	 at	 the
mercy	 of	 their	 moods.	 People’s	 track	 records	 at	 shaki ng	 bad	 moods
were	decidedly	mixed.

THE	ANATOMY	OF	RAGE
Say	someone	in	another	car	cuts	dangerously	close	to 	you	as	you	are
driving	 on	 the	 freeway.	 If	 your	 reflexive	 thought	 i s	 “That	 son	 of	 a
bitch!”	 it	 matters	 immensely	 for	 the	 trajectory	 of	 rag e	 whether	 that
thought	 is	 followed	 by	 more	 thoughts	 of	 outrage	 and	 revenge:	 “He
could	have	hit	me!	That	bastard—I	can’t	let	him	get	aw ay	with	that!”
Your	knuckles	whiten	as	you	tighten	your	hold	on	th e	steering	wheel,
a	surrogate	for	strangling	his	throat.	Your	body	mob ilizes	to	fight,	not
run—leaving	 you	 trembling,	 beads	 of	 sweat	 on	 your	 for ehead,	 your
heart	pounding,	the	muscles	in	your	face	locked	in	a 	scowl.	You	want
to	kill	the	guy.	Then,	should	a	car	behind	you	honk 	because	you	have
slowed	down	after	the	close	call,	you	are	apt	to	ex plode	in	rage	at	that
driver	 too.	 Such	 is	 the	 stuff	 of	 hypertension,	 reck less	 driving,	 even
freeway	shootings.
Contrast	that	sequence	of	building	rage	with	a	more	 charitable	line
of	thought	toward	the	driver	who	cut	you	off:	“Mayb e	he	didn’t	see
me,	or	maybe	he	had	some	good	reason	for	driving	so	car elessly,	such
as	a	medical	emergency.”	That	line	of	possibility	temp ers	anger	with
mercy,	or	at	least	an	open	mind,	short-circuiting	the 	buildup	of	rage.
The	 problem,	 as	 Aristotle’s	 challenge	 to	 have	 only	 appropriate 	 anger
reminds	 us,	 is	 that	 more	 often	 than	 not	 our	 anger	 sur ges	 out	 of
control.	 Benjamin	 Franklin	 put	 it	 well:	 “Anger	 is	 ne ver	 without	 a
reason,	but	seldom	a	good	one.”
There	 are,	 of	 course,	 different	 kinds	 of	 anger.	 The 	 amygdala	 may
well	be	a	main	source	of	the	sudden	spark	of	rage	we 	feel	at	the	driver
whose	carelessness	endangers	us.	But	the	other	end	 of	the	emotional
circuitry,	the	neocortex,	most	likely	foments	more	cal culated	angers,
such	 as	 cool-headed	 revenge	 or	 outrage	 at	 unfairnes s	 or	 injustice.
Such	 thoughtful	 angers	 are	 those	 most	 likely,	 as	 Fra nklin	 put	 it,	 to
“have	good	reasons”	or	seem	to.
Of	all	the	moods	that	people	want	to	escape,	rage	se ems	to	be	the
most	intransigent;	Tice	found	anger	is	the	mood	peopl e	are	worst	at
controlling.	 Indeed,	 anger	 is	 the	 most	 seductive	 of	 the	 negative
emotions;	the	self-righteous	inner	monologue	that	pro pels	it	along	fills
the	mind	with	the	most	convincing	arguments	for	ventin g	rage.	Unlike
sadness,	 anger	 is	 energizing,	 even	 exhilarating.	 An ger’s	 seductive,
persuasive	power	may	in	itself	explain	why	some	views 	about	it	are	so
common:	that	anger	 is	uncontrollable,	or	 that,	at	any 	 rate,	it	should
not	 be	 controlled,	 and	 that	 venting	 anger	 in	 “catharsi s”	 is	 all	 to	 the
======================================== [Página 80] ========================================

good.	A	contrasting	view,	perhaps	a	reaction	agains t	the	bleak	picture
of	these	other	two,	holds	that	anger	can	be	prevent ed	entirely.	But	a
careful	 reading	 of	 research	 findings	 suggests	 that	 all	 these	 common
attitudes	toward	anger	are	misguided,	if	not	outright	myths. 4
The	train	of	angry	thoughts	that	stokes	anger	is	al so	potentially	the
key	to	one	of	the	most	powerful	ways	to	defuse	anger :	undermining
the	convictions	that	are	fueling	the	anger	in	the	f irst	place.	The	longer
we	ruminate	about	what	has	made	us	angry,	the	more	“go od	reasons”
and	 self-justifications	 for	 being	 angry	 we	 can	 inve nt.	 Brooding	 fuels
anger’s	flames.	But	seeing	things	differently	douses 	those	flames.	Tice
found	that	reframing	a	situation	more	positively	was	 one	of	the	most
potent	ways	to	put	anger	to	rest.
The	Rage	“Rush”
That	 finding	 squares	 well	 with	 the	 conclusions	 of	 U niversity	 of
Alabama	 psychologist	 Dolf	 Zillmann,	 who,	 in	 a	 lengthy	 series	 of
careful	 experiments,	 has	 taken	 precise	 measure	 of	 ang er	 and	 the
anatomy	of	rage. 5	 Given	 the	 roots	 of	 anger	 in	 the	 fight	 wing	 of	 the
fight-or-flight	 response,	 it	 is	 no	 surprise	 that	 Zil lmann	 finds	 that	 a
universal	 trigger	 for	 anger	 is	 the	 sense	 of	 being	 e ndangered.
Endangerment	can	be	signaled	not	just	by	an	outright 	physical	threat
but	also,	as	is	more	often	the	case,	by	a	symbolic	th reat	to	self-esteem
or	 dignity:	 being	 treated	 unjustly	 or	 rudely,	 being 	 insulted	 or
demeaned,	 being	 frustrated	 in	 pursuing	 an	 important	 g oal.	 These
perceptions	act	as	the	instigating	trigger	for	a	li mbic	surge	that	has	a
dual	 effect	 on	 the	 brain.	 One	 part	 of	 that	 surge	 is 	 a	 release	 of
catecholamines,	 which	 generate	 a	 quick,	 episodic	 rus h	 of	 energy,
enough	for	“one	course	of	vigorous	action,”	as	Zillma nn	puts	it,	“such
as	in	fight	or	flight.”	This	energy	surge	lasts	for 	minutes,	during	which
it	 readies	 the	 body	 for	 a	 good	 fight	 or	 a	 quick	 fli ght,	 depending	 on
how	the	emotional	brain	sizes	up	the	opposition.
Meanwhile,	 another	 amygdala-driven	 ripple	 through	 th e
adrenocortical	 branch	 of	 the	 nervous	 system	 creates	 a	 general	 tonic
background	 of	 action	 readiness,	 which	 lasts	 much	 lon ger	 than	 the
catecholamine	 energy	 surge.	 This	 generalized	 adrenal 	 and	 cortical
excitation	 can	 last	 for	 hours	 and	 even	 days,	 keepin g	 the	 emotional
brain	in	special	readiness	for	arousal,	and	becoming 	a	foundation	on
which	 subsequent	 reactions	 can	 build	 with	 particula r	 quickness.	 In
general,	 the	 hair-trigger	 condition	 created	 by	 adre nocortical	 arousal
======================================== [Página 81] ========================================

explains	 why	 people	 are	 so	 much	 more	 prone	 to	 anger	 i f	 they	 have
already	been	provoked	or	slightly	irritated	by	something	els e.	Stress	of
all	 sorts	 creates	 adrenocortical	 arousal,	 lowering	 the	 threshold	 for
what	provokes	anger.	Thus	someone	who	has	had	a	hard 	day	at	work
is	 especially	 vulnerable	 to	 becoming	 enraged	 later	 a t	 home	 by
something—the	kids	being	too	noisy	or	messy,	say—that	u nder	other
circumstances	would	not	be	powerful	enough	to	trigge r	an	emotional
hijacking.
Zillmann	 comes	 to	 these	 insights	 on	 anger	 through	 care ful
experimentation.	In	a	typical	study,	for	example,	he	 had	a	confederate
provoke	 men	 and	 women	 who	 had	 volunteered	 by	 making	 sn ide
remarks	 about	 them.	 The	 volunteers	 then	 watched	 a	 ple asant	 or
upsetting	film.	Later	the	volunteers	were	given	the	 chance	to	retaliate
against	the	confederate	by	giving	an	evaluation	the y	thought	would
be	used	in	a	decision	whether	or	not	to	hire	him.	The	intensity	o f	their
retaliation	was	directly	proportional	to	how	arouse d	they	had	gotten
from	the	film	 they	had	just	 watched;	they	were	 angrie r	after	 seeing
the	unpleasant	film,	and	gave	the	worst	ratings.
Anger	Builds	on	Anger
Zillmann’s	studies	seem	to	explain	the	dynamic	at	work	 in	a	familiar
domestic	 drama	 I	 witnessed	 one	 day	 while	 shopping.	 Do wn	 the
supermarket	 aisle	 drifted	 the	 emphatic,	 measured	 tones 	 of	 a	 young
mother	to	her	son,	about	three:	“Put	…	it	…	back!”
“But	I	want	it!”	he	whined,	clinging	more	tightly	to	a	Ninja	Tu rtles
cereal	box.
“Put	it	back!”	Louder,	her	anger	taking	over.
At	that	moment	the	baby	in	her	shopping	cart	seat	dro pped	the	jar
of	 jelly	 she	 had	 been	 mouthing.	 When	 it	 shattered	 on 	 the	 floor	 the
mother	yelled,	“That’s	it!”	and,	in	a	fury,	slapped	 the	baby,	grabbed
the	 three-year-old’s	 box	 and	 slammed	 it	 onto	 the	 near est	 shelf,
scooped	him	up	by	the	waist,	and	rushed	down	the	ais le,	the	shopping
cart	careening	perilously	in	front,	the	baby	now	cr ying,	her	son,	his
legs	dangling,	protesting,	“Put	me	 down ,	put	me	down !”
Zillmann	 has	 found	 that	 when	 the	 body	 is	 already	 in	 a 	 state	 of
edginess,	 like	 the	 mother’s,	 and	 something	 triggers	 a n	 emotional
hijacking,	 the	 subsequent	 emotion,	 whether	 anger	 or	 anxiety,	 is	 of
especially	 great	 intensity.	 This	 dynamic	 is	 at	 work	 when	 someone
becomes	 enraged.	 Zillmann	 sees	 escalating	 anger	 as	 “a	 sequence	 of
======================================== [Página 82] ========================================

provocations,	 each	 triggering	 an	 excitatory	 reactio n	 that	 dissipates
slowly.”	In	this	sequence	every	successive	anger-pr ovoking	thought	or
perception	 becomes	 a	 minitrigger	 for	 amygdala-driven	 s urges	 of
catecholamines,	each	building	on	the	hormonal	momentum	o f	those
that	went	before.	A	second	comes	before	the	first	ha s	subsided,	and	a
third	 on	 top	 of	 those,	 and	 so	 on;	 each	 wave	 rides	 t he	 tails	 of	 those
before,	quickly	escalating	the	body’s	level	of	phys iological	arousal.	A
thought	that	comes	later	in	this	buildup	triggers	a	 far	greater	intensity
of	anger	than	one	that	comes	at	the	beginning.	Anger 	builds	on	anger;
the	emotional	brain	heats	up.	By	then	rage,	unhampere d	by	reason,
easily	erupts	in	violence.
At	 this	 point	 people	 are	 unforgiving	 and	 beyond	 bei ng	 reasoned
with;	their	thoughts	revolve	around	revenge	and	rep risal,	oblivious	to
what	the	consequences	may	be.	This	high	level	of	exc itation,	Zillmann
says,	“fosters	an	illusion	of	power	and	invulnerabi lity	that	may	inspire
and	 facilitate	 aggression”	 as	 the	 enraged	 person,	 “ failing	 cognitive
guidance,”	falls	back	on	the	most	primitive	of	respon ses.	The	limbic
urge	is	ascendant;	the	rawest	lessons	of	life’s	bru tality	become	guides
to	action.
Balm	for	Anger
Given	 this	 analysis	 of	 the	 anatomy	 of	 rage,	 Zillmann	 s ees	 two	 main
ways	 of	 intervening.	 One	 way	 of	 defusing	 anger	 is	 t o	 seize	 on	 and
challenge	the	thoughts	that	trigger	the	surges	of	a nger,	since	it	is	the
original	appraisal	of	an	interaction	that	confirms	a nd	encourages	the
first	 burst	 of	 anger,	 and	 the	 subsequent	 reappraisa ls	 that	 fan	 the
flames.	 Timing	 matters;	 the	 earlier	 in	 the	 anger	 cycle 	 the	 more
effective.	 Indeed,	 anger	 can	 be	 completely	 short-cir cuited	 if	 the
mitigating	information	comes	before	the	anger	is	acted	on.
The	power	of	understanding	to	deflate	anger	is	clea r	from	another
of	Zillmann’s	experiments,	in	which	a	rude	assistant	( a	confederate)
insulted	 and	 provoked	 volunteers	 who	 were	 riding	 an 	 exercise	 bike.
When	 the	 volunteers	 were	 given	 the	 chance	 to	 retali ate	 against	 the
rude	 experimenter	 (again,	 by	 giving	 a	 bad	 evaluation 	 they	 thought
would	be	used	in	weighing	his	candidacy	for	a	job)	 they	did	so	with
an	 angry	 glee.	 But	 in	 one	 version	 of	 the	 experiment	 another
confederate	entered	after	the	volunteers	had	been	p rovoked,	and	just
before	the	chance	to	retaliate;	she	told	the	provoc ative	experimenter
he	had	a	phone	call	down	the	hall.	As	he	left	he	mad e	a	snide	remark
======================================== [Página 83] ========================================

to	her	too.	But	she	took	it	in	good	spirits,	explai ning	after	he	left	that
he	 was	 under	 terrible	 pressures,	 upset	 about	 his	 up coming	 graduate
orals.	 After	 that	 the	 irate	 volunteers,	 when	 offere d	 the	 chance	 to
retaliate	against	the	rude	fellow,	chose	not	to;	in stead	they	expressed
compassion	for	his	plight.
Such	 mitigating	 information	 allows	 a	 reappraisal	 of	 t he	 anger-
provoking	 events.	 But	 there	 is	 a	 specific	 window	 of 	 opportunity	 for
this	de-escalation.	Zillmann	finds	it	works	well	at	mo derate	levels	of
anger;	at	high	levels	of	rage	it	makes	no	difference 	because	of	what	he
calls	“cognitive	incapacitation”—in	other	words,	peo ple	can	no	longer
think	 straight.	 When	 people	 were	 already	 highly	 enr aged,	 they
dismissed	 the	 mitigating	 information	 with	 “That’s	 just 	 too	 bad!”	 or
“the	 strongest	 vulgarities	 the	 English	 language	 has 	 to	 offer,”	 as
Zillmann	put	it	with	delicacy.
Cooling	Down
Once	when	I	was	about	13,	in	an	angry	fit,	I	walked	 out	of	the	house	vowing	I	would
never	return.	It	was	a	beautiful	summer	day,	and	I	wal ked	far	along	lovely	lanes,	till
gradually	 the	 stillness	 and	 beauty	 calmed	 and	 soothed	 me,	 and	 after	 some	 hours	 I
returned	repentant	and	almost	melted.	Since	then	when	I 	am	angry,	I	do	this	if	I	can,
and	find	it	the	best	cure.
The	account	is	by	a	subject	in	one	of	the	very	firs t	scientific	studies
of	anger,	done	in	1899. 6	It	still	stands	as	a	model	of	the	second	way	of
de-escalating	 anger:	 cooling	 off	 physiologically	 by 	 waiting	 out	 the
adrenal	 surge	 in	 a	 setting	 where	 there	 are	 not	 like ly	 to	 be	 further
triggers	 for	 rage.	 In	 an	 argument,	 for	 instance,	 tha t	 means	 getting
away	from	the	other	person	for	the	time	being.	During 	the	cooling-off
period,	 the	 angered	 person	 can	 put	 the	 brakes	 on	 th e	 cycle	 of
escalating	 hostile	 thought	 by	 seeking	 out	 distracti ons.	 Distraction,
Zillmann	finds,	is	a	highly	powerful	mood-altering	device,	for 	a	simple
reason:	It’s	hard	to	stay	angry	when	we’re	having	a 	pleasant	time.	The
trick,	of	course,	is	to	get	anger	to	cool	to	the	point	where	some one	can
have	a	pleasant	time	in	the	first	place.
Zillmann’s	 analysis	 of	 the	 ways	 anger	 escalates	 and	 d e-escalates
explains	 many	 of	 Diane	 Tice’s	 findings	 about	 the	 str ategies	 people
commonly	 say	 they	 use	 to	 ease	 anger.	 One	 such	 fairly	 effective
strategy	 is	 going	 off	 to	 be	 alone	 while	 cooling	 dow n.	 A	 large
proportion	of	men	translate	this	into	going	for	a	dr ive—a	finding	that
======================================== [Página 84] ========================================

gives	one	pause	when	driving	(and,	Tice	told	me,	ins pired	her	to	drive
more	defensively).	Perhaps	a	safer	alternative	is	go ing	for	a	long	walk;
active	exercise	also	helps	with	anger.	So	do	relaxa tion	methods	such
as	 deep	 breathing	 and	 muscle	 relaxation,	 perhaps	 bec ause	 they
change	the	body’s	physiology	from	the	high	arousal	o f	anger	to	a	low-
arousal	 state,	 and	 perhaps	 too	 because	 they	 distrac t	 from	 whatever
triggered	the	anger.	Active	exercise	may	cool	anger	 for	something	of
the	 same	 reason:	 after	 high	 levels	 of	 physiological	 activation	 during
the	exercise,	the	body	rebounds	to	a	low	level	once	it	stops.
But	 a	 cooling-down	 period	 will	 not	 work	 if	 that	 time 	 is	 used	 to
pursue	the	train	of	anger-inducing	thought,	since	e ach	such	thought	is
in	 itself	 a	 minor	 trigger	 for	 more	 cascades	 of	 anger. 	 The	 power	 of
distraction	is	that	it	stops	that	angry	train	of	th ought.	In	her	survey	of
people’s	strategies	for	handling	anger,	Tice	found	 that	distractions	by
and	 large	 help	 calm	 anger:	 TV,	 movies,	 reading,	 and	 t he	 like	 all
interfere	 with	 the	 angry	 thoughts	 that	 stoke	 rage.	 But,	 Tice	 found,
indulging	 in	 treats	 such	 as	 shopping	 for	 oneself	 an d	 eating	 do	 not
have	much	effect;	it	is	all	too	easy	to	continue	wit h	an	indignant	train
of	 thought	 while	 cruising	 a	 shopping	 mall	 or	 devouri ng	 a	 piece	 of
chocolate	cake.
To	 these	 strategies	 add	 those	 developed	 by	 Redford	 Williams,	 a
psychiatrist	 at	 Duke	 University	 who	 sought	 to	 help	 hostile	 people,
who	are	at	higher	risk	for	heart	disease,	to	contro l	their	irritability. 7
One	of	his	recommendations	is	to	use	self-awareness	t o	catch	cynical
or	hostile	thoughts	as	they	arise,	and	write	them	do wn.	Once	angry
thoughts	 are	 captured	 this	 way,	 they	 can	 be	 challen ged	 and
reappraised,	 though,	 as	 Zillmann	 found,	 this	 approach 	 works	 better
before	anger	has	escalated	to	rage.
The	Ventilation	Fallacy
As	I	settle	into	a	New	York	City	cab,	a	young	man	cr ossing	the	street
stops	 in	 front	 of	 the	 cab	 to	 wait	 for	 traffic	 to	 cl ear.	 The	 driver,
impatient	to	start,	honks,	motioning	for	the	young	man 	to	move	out	of
the	way.	The	reply	is	a	scowl	and	an	obscene	gesture.
“You	 son	 of	 a	 bitch!”	 the	 driver	 yells,	 making	 threa tening	 lunges
with	the	cab	by	hitting	the	accelerator	and	brake	a t	the	same	time.	At
this	 lethal	 threat,	 the	 young	 man	 sullenly	 moves	 asid e,	 barely,	 and
smacks	his	fist	against	the	cab	as	it	inches	by	into 	traffic.	At	this,	the
driver	shouts	a	foul	litany	of	expletives	at	the	man.
======================================== [Página 85] ========================================

As	we	move	along	the	driver,	still	visibly	agitated, 	tells	me,	“You
can’t	take	any	shit	from	anyone.	You	gotta	yell	back—at	least	it 	makes
you	feel	better!”
Catharsis—giving	vent	to	rage—is	sometimes	extolled	as	 a	way	of
handling	 anger.	 The	 popular	 theory	 holds	 that	 “it	 ma kes	 you	 feel
better.”	 But,	 as	 Zillmann’s	 findings	 suggest,	 there	 i s	 an	 argument
against	 catharsis.	 It	 has	 been	 made	 since	 the	 1950s, 	 when
psychologists	 started	 to	 test	 the	 effects	 of	 cathar sis	 experimentally
and,	 time	 after	 time,	 found	 that	 giving	 vent	 to	 anger 	 did	 little	 or
nothing	to	dispel	it	(though,	because	of	the	seduct ive	nature	of	anger,
it	may	feel	satisfying). 8	There	may	be	some	specific	conditions	under
which	lashing	out	in	anger	does	work:	when	it	is	ex pressed	directly	to
the	 person	 who	 is	 its	 target,	 when	 it	 restores	 a	 se nse	 of	 control	 or
rights	an	injustice,	or	when	it	inflicts	“appropria te	harm”	on	the	other
person	 and	 gets	 him	 to	 change	 some	 grievous	 activity	 without
retaliating.	But	because	of	the	incendiary	nature	o f	anger,	this	may	be
easier	to	say	than	to	do. 9
Tice	found	that	ventilating	anger	is	one	of	the	wor st	ways	to	cool
down:	 outbursts	 of	 rage	 typically	 pump	 up	 the	 emotion al	 brain’s
arousal,	leaving	people	feeling	more	angry,	not	less .	Tice	found	that
when	people	told	of	times	they	had	taken	their	rage	 out	on	the	person
who	provoked	it,	the	net	effect	was	to	prolong	the	 mood	rather	than
end	 it.	 Far	 more	 effective	 was	 when	 people	 first	 coo led	 down,	 and
then,	 in	 a	 more	 constructive	 or	 assertive	 manner,	 con fronted	 the
person	 to	 settle	 their	 dispute.	 As	 I	 once	 heard	 Cho gyam	 Trungpa,	 a
Tibetan	teacher,	reply	when	asked	how	best	to	handl e	anger:	“Don’t
suppress	it.	But	don’t	act	on	it.”
SOOTHING	ANXIETY:	WHAT,	ME	WORRY?
Oh,	 no!	 The	 muffler	 sounds	 bad.…	 What	 if	 I	 have	 to	 take	 it	 to 	 the	 shop?…	 I	 can’t
afford	the	expense.…	I’d	have	to	draw	the	money	from	Jamie’s 	college	fund.…	What	if
I	can’t	afford	his	tuition?…	That	bad	school	report	last	w eek.…	What	if	his	grades	go
down	and	he	can’t	get	into	college?…	Muffler	sounds	bad .…
And	so	the	worrying	mind	spins	on	in	an	endless	loop 	of	low-grade
melodrama,	one	set	of	concerns	leading	on	to	the	next	and	back	ag ain.
The	 above	 specimen	 is	 offered	 by	 Lizabeth	 Roemer	 and	 Thomas
Borkovec,	 Pennsylvania	 State	 University	 psychologis ts,	 whose
======================================== [Página 86] ========================================

research	on	worrying—the	heart	of	all	anxiety—has	rai sed	the	topic
from	 neurotic’s	 art	 to	 science. 10	 There	 is,	 of	 course,	 no	 hitch	 when
worry	 works;	 by	 mulling	 over	 a	 problem—that	 is,	 employi ng
constructive	reflection,	which	can	look	like	worryi ng—a	solution	can
appear.	Indeed,	the	reaction	that	underlies	worry	i s	the	vigilance	for
potential	danger	that	has,	no	doubt,	been	essential 	for	survival	over
the	course	of	evolution.	When	fear	triggers	the	emot ional	brain,	part
of	the	resulting	anxiety	fixates	attention	on	the	t hreat	at	hand,	forcing
the	mind	to	obsess	about	how	to	handle	it	and	ignore 	anything	else
for	the	time	being.	Worry	is,	in	a	sense,	a	rehearsa l	of	what	might	go
wrong	 and	 how	 to	 deal	 with	 it;	 the	 task	 of	 worrying 	 is	 to	 come	 up
with	positive	solutions	for	life’s	perils	by	antici pating	dangers	before
they	arise.
The	 difficulty	 is	 with	 chronic,	 repetitive	 worries, 	 the	 kind	 that
recycle	 on	 and	 on	 and	 never	 get	 any	 nearer	 a	 positi ve	 solution.	 A
close	analysis	of	chronic	worry	suggests	that	it	ha s	all	the	attributes	of
a	 low-grade	 emotional	 hijacking:	 the	 worries	 seem	 to	 come	 from
nowhere,	 are	 uncontrollable,	 generate	 a	 steady	 hum	 o f	 anxiety,	 are
impervious	 to	 reason,	 and	 lock	 the	 worrier	 into	 a	 si ngle,	 inflexible
view	 of	 the	 worrisome	 topic.	 When	 this	 same	 cycle	 of	 worry
intensifies	and	persists,	it	shades	over	the	line	i nto	full-blown	neural
hijackings,	 the	 anxiety	 disorders:	 phobias,	 obsessi ons	 and
compulsions,	panic	attacks.	In	each	of	these	disorde rs	worry	fixates	in
a	 distinct	 fashion;	 for	 the	 phobic,	 anxieties	 rivet 	 on	 the	 feared
situation;	 for	 the	 obsessive,	 they	 fixate	 on	 preven ting	 some	 feared
calamity;	in	panic	attacks,	the	worries	can	focus	on 	a	fear	of	dying	or
on	the	prospect	of	having	the	attack	itself.
In	all	these	conditions	the	common	denominator	is	worr y	run	amok.
For	 example,	 a	 woman	 being	 treated	 for	 obsessive-compu lsive
disorder	 had	 a	 series	 of	 rituals	 that	 took	 most	 of	 h er	 waking	 hours:
forty-five-minute	showers	several	times	daily,	washin g	her	hands	for
five	 minutes	 twenty	 or	 more	 times	 a	 day.	 She	 would	 not 	 sit	 down
unless	she	first	swabbed	the	seat	with	rubbing	alco hol	to	sterilize	it.
Nor	would	she	touch	a	child	or	an	animal—both	were	“t oo	dirty.”	All
these	 compulsions	 were	 stirred	 by	 her	 underlying	 morb id	 fear	 of
germs;	 she	 worried	 constantly	 that	 without	 her	 washi ng	 and
sterilizing	she	would	catch	a	disease	and	die. 11
A	 woman	 being	 treated	 for	 “generalized	 anxiety	 disor der”—the
psychiatric	nomenclature	for	being	a	constant	worrie r—responded	to
the	request	to	worry	aloud	for	one	minute	this	way:
======================================== [Página 87] ========================================

I	might	not	do	this	right.	This	may	be	so	artificial	that	it 	won’t	be	an	indication	of	the
real	thing	and	we	need	to	get	at	the	real	thing.…	Becau se	if	we	don’t	get	at	the	real
thing,	I	won’t	get	well.	And	if	I	don’t	get	well	I’l l	never	be	happy.12
In	 this	 virtuoso	 display	 of	 worrying	 about	 worrying ,	 the	 very
request	 to	 worry	 for	 one	 minute	 had,	 within	 a	 few	 sh ort	 seconds,
escalated	 to	 contemplation	 of	 a	 lifelong	 catastrophe :	 “I’ll	 never	 be
happy.”	Worries	typically	follow	such	lines,	a	narr ative	to	oneself	that
jumps	 from	 concern	 to	 concern	 and	 more	 often	 than	 not	 includes
catastrophizing,	imagining	some	terrible	tragedy.	Wor ries	are	almost
always	expressed	in	the	mind’s	ear,	not	its	eye—that	 is,	in	words,	not
images—a	fact	that	has	significance	for	controlling	worry.
Borkovec	and	his	colleagues	began	to	study	worrying 	per	se	when
they	were	trying	to	come	up	with	a	treatment	for	inso mnia.	Anxiety,
other	 researchers	 have	 observed,	 comes	 in	 two	 forms:	 cognitive ,	 or
worrisome	 thoughts,	 and	 somatic ,	 the	 physiological	 symptoms	 of
anxiety,	such	as	sweating,	a	racing	heart,	or	muscle 	tension.	The	main
trouble	 with	 insomniacs,	 Borkovec	 found,	 was	 not	 the 	 somatic
arousal.	 What	 kept	 them	 up	 were	 intrusive	 thoughts.	 They	 were
chronic	worriers,	and	could	not	stop	worrying,	no	ma tter	how	sleepy
they	 were.	 The	 one	 thing	 that	 worked	 in	 helping	 the m	 get	 to	 sleep
was	 getting	 their	 minds	 off	 their	 worries,	 focusing	 instead	 on	 the
sensations	 produced	 by	 a	 relaxation	 method.	 In	 short ,	 the	 worries
could	be	stopped	by	shifting	attention	away.
Most	worriers,	however,	can’t	seem	to	do	this.	The	reason,	Bor kovec
believes,	has	to	do	with	a	partial	payoff	from	worry ing	that	is	highly
reinforcing	 to	 the	 habit.	 There	 is,	 it	 seems,	 somethi ng	 positive	 in
worries:	worries	are	ways	to	deal	with	potential	th reats,	with	dangers
that	may	come	one’s	way.	The	work	of	worrying—when	it	 succeeds—
is	to	rehearse	what	those	dangers	are,	and	to	refle ct	on	ways	to	deal
with	them.	But	worry	doesn’t	work	all	that	well.	New 	solutions	and
fresh	ways	of	seeing	a	problem	do	not	typically	come	 from	worrying,
especially	chronic	worry.	Instead	of	coming	up	with	 solutions	to	these
potential	problems,	worriers	typically	simply	ruminate 	on	the	danger
itself,	immersing	themselves	in	a	low-key	way	in	the	d read	associated
with	 it	 while	 staying	 in	 the	 same	 rut	 of	 thought.	 Ch ronic	 worriers
worry	 about	 a	 wide	 range	 of	 things,	 most	 of	 which	 ha ve	 almost	 no
chance	of	happening;	they	read	dangers	into	life’s	 journey	that	others
never	notice.
Yet	 chronic	 worriers	 tell	 Borkovec	 that	 worrying	 he lps	 them,	 and
======================================== [Página 88] ========================================

that	 their	 worries	 are	 self-perpetuating,	 an	 endles s	 loop	 of	 angst-
ridden	thought.	Why	should	worry	become	what	seems	to	amount	to	a
mental	addiction?	Oddly,	as	Borkovec	points	out,	the 	worry	habit	is
reinforcing	 in	 the	 same	 sense	 that	 superstitions	 are .	 Since	 people
worry	about	many	things	that	have	a	very	low	probabi lity	of	actually
occurring—a	loved	one	dying	in	a	plane	crash,	going	 bankrupt,	and
the	 like—there	 is,	 to	 the	 primitive	 limbic	 brain	 at	 le ast,	 something
magical	about	it.	Like	an	amulet	that	wards	off	some	a nticipated	evil,
the	worry	psychologically	gets	the	credit	for	preve nting	the	danger	it
obsesses	about.
The	Work	of	Worrying
She	had	moved	to	Los	Angeles	from	the	Midwest,	lured	by	a 	job	with	a	publisher.	But
the	 publisher	 was	 bought	 by	 another	 soon	 after,	 and	 she	 w as	 left	 without	 a	 job.
Turning	to	freelance	writing,	an	erratic	marketplace,	 she	found	herself	either	swamped
with	work	or	unable	to	pay	her	rent.	She	often	had	to	ra tion	phone	calls,	and	for	the
first	 time	 was	 without	 health	 insurance.	 This	 lack	 of	 cover age	 was	 particularly
distressing:	 she	 found	 herself	 catastrophizing	 about	 her	 health,	 sure	 every	 headache
signaled	 a	 brain	 tumor,	 picturing	 herself	 in	 an	 accide nt	 whenever	 she	 had	 to	 drive
somewhere.	 She	 often	 found	 herself	 lost	 in	 a	 long	 reveri e	 of	 worry,	 a	 medley	 of
distress.	But,	she	said,	she	found	her	worries	almost	a ddictive.
Borkovec	discovered	another	unexpected	benefit	to	w orrying.	While
people	are	immersed	in	their	worried	thoughts,	they	d o	not	seem	to
notice	the	subjective	sensations	of	the	anxiety	tho se	worries	stir—the
speedy	heartbeat,	the	beads	of	sweat,	the	shakiness —and	as	the	worry
proceeds	it	actually	seems	to	suppress	some	of	that	a nxiety,	at	least	as
reflected	in	heart	rate.	The	sequence	presumably	goe s	something	like
this:	 The	 worrier	 notices	 something	 that	 triggers	 th e	 image	 of	 some
potential	threat	or	danger;	that	imagined	catastroph e	in	turn	triggers
a	mild	attack	of	anxiety.	The	worrier	then	plunges	i nto	a	long	series	of
distressed	thoughts,	each	of	which	primes	yet	anothe r	topic	for	worry;
as	 attention	 continues	 to	 be	 carried	 along	 by	 this	 train	 of	 worry,
focusing	 on	 these	 very	 thoughts	 takes	 the	 mind	 off	 t he	 original
catastrophic	 image	 that	 triggered	 the	 anxiety.	 Images ,	 Borkovec
found,	are	more	powerful	triggers	for	physiological	 anxiety	than	are
thoughts,	so	immersion	in	thoughts,	to	the	exclusion	 of	catastrophic
images,	 partially	 alleviates	 the	 experience	 of	 being 	 anxious.	 And,	 to
that	extent,	the	worry	is	also	reinforced,	as	a	hal fway	antidote	to	the
======================================== [Página 89] ========================================

very	anxiety	it	evoked.
But	chronic	worries	are	self-defeating	too	in	that	 they	take	the	form
of	 stereotyped,	 rigid	 ideas,	 not	 creative	 breakthro ughs	 that	 actually
move	toward	solving	the	problem.	This	rigidity	shows	 up	not	just	in
the	manifest	content	of	worried	thought,	which	simply 	repeats	more
or	less	the	same	ideas	over	and	over.	But	at	a	neuro logical	level	there
seems	to	be	a	cortical	rigidity,	a	deficit	in	the	emo tional	brain’s	ability
to	respond	flexibly	to	changing	circumstance.	In	sho rt,	chronic	worry
works	 in	 some	 ways,	 but	 not	 in	 other,	 more	 consequent ial	 ones:	 it
eases	some	anxiety,	but	never	solves	the	problem.
The	one	thing	that	chronic	worriers	cannot	do	is	fo llow	the	advice
they	 are	 most	 often	 given:	 “Just	 stop	 worrying”	 (or, 	 worse,	 “Don’t
worry—be	 happy”).	 Since	 chronic	 worries	 seem	 to	 be	 lo w-grade
amygdala	 episodes,	 they	 come	 unbidden.	 And,	 by	 their	 very	 nature,
they	 persist	 once	 they	 arise	 in	 the	 mind.	 But	 after	 much
experimentation,	Borkovec	discovered	some	simple	steps 	that	can	help
even	the	most	chronic	worrier	control	the	habit.
The	first	step	is	self-awareness,	catching	the	worr isome	episodes	as
near	their	beginning	as	possible—ideally,	as	soon	as 	or	just	after	the
fleeting	catastrophic	image	triggers	the	worry-anxie ty	cycle.	Borkovec
trains	people	in	this	approach	by	first	teaching	th em	to	monitor	cues
for	 anxiety,	 especially	 learning	 to	 identify	 situat ions	 that	 trigger
worry,	or	the	fleeting	thoughts	and	images	that	init iate	the	worry,	as
well	 as	 the	 accompanying	 sensations	 of	 anxiety	 in	 th e	 body.	 With
practice,	people	can	identify	the	worries	at	an	ear lier	and	earlier	point
in	the	anxiety	spiral.	People	also	learn	relaxation 	methods	that	they
can	 apply	 at	 the	 moment	 they	 recognize	 the	 worry	 begi nning,	 and
practice	the	relaxation	method	daily	so	they	will	be 	able	to	use	it	on
the	spot,	when	they	need	it	the	most.
The	 relaxation	 method,	 though,	 is	 not	 enough	 in	 itse lf.	 Worriers
also	 need	 to	 actively	 challenge	 the	 worrisome	 though ts;	 failing	 this,
the	worry	spiral	will	keep	coming	back.	So	the	next	 step	is	to	take	a
critical	stance	toward	their	assumptions:	Is	it	very 	probable	that	the
dreaded	event	will	occur?	Is	it	necessarily	the	cas e	that	there	is	only
one	or	no	alternative	to	letting	it	happen?	Are	the re	constructive	steps
to	 be	 taken?	 Does	 it	 really	 help	 to	 run	 through	 the se	 same	 anxious
thoughts	over	and	over?
This	 combination	 of	 mindfulness	 and	 healthy	 skepticis m	 would,
presumably,	 act	 as	 a	 brake	 on	 the	 neural	 activation	 that	 underlies
low-grade	anxiety.	Actively	generating	such	thought s	may	prime	the
======================================== [Página 90] ========================================

circuitry	 that	 can	 inhibit	 the	 limbic	 driving	 of	 wor ry;	 at	 the	 same
time,	actively	inducing	a	relaxed	state	counters	the 	signals	for	anxiety
the	emotional	brain	is	sending	throughout	the	body.
Indeed,	 Borkovec	 points	 out,	 these	 strategies	 estab lish	 a	 train	 of
mental	 activity	 that	 is	 incompatible	 with	 worry.	 When 	 a	 worry	 is
allowed	to	repeat	over	and	over	unchallenged,	it	ga ins	in	persuasive
power;	 challenging	 it	 by	 contemplating	 a	 range	 of	 eq ually	 plausible
points	 of	 view	 keeps	 the	 one	 worried	 thought	 from	 be ing	 naively
taken	as	true.	Even	some	people	whose	worrying	is	se rious	enough	to
qualify	for	a	psychiatric	diagnosis	have	been	relie ved	of	the	worrying
habit	this	way.
On	 the	 other	 hand,	 for	 people	 with	 worries	 so	 sever e	 they	 have
flowered	 into	 phobia,	 obsessive-compulsive	 disorder, 	 or	 panic
disorder,	it	may	be	prudent—indeed,	a	sign	of	self-aw areness—to	turn
to	 medication	 to	 interrupt	 the	 cycle.	 A	 retraining	 o f	 the	 emotional
circuitry	through	therapy	is	still	called	for,	howe ver,	in	order	to	lessen
the	 likelihood	 that	 anxiety	 disorders	 will	 recur	 wh en	 medication	 is
stopped. 13
MANAGING	MELANCHOLY
The	 single	 mood	 people	 generally	 put	 most	 effort	 into 	 shaking	 is
sadness;	 Diane	 Tice	 found	 that	 people	 are	 most	 inven tive	 when	 it
comes	to	trying	to	escape	the	blues.	Of	course,	not	 all	sadness	should
be	escaped;	melancholy,	like	every	other	mood,	has	it s	benefits.	The
sadness	that	a	loss	brings	has	certain	invariable	e ffects:	it	closes	down
our	interest	in	diversions	and	pleasures,	fixes	att ention	on	what	has
been	lost,	and	saps	our	energy	for	starting	new	ende avors—at	least	for
the	time	being.	In	short,	it	enforces	a	kind	of	refl ective	retreat	from
life’s	busy	pursuits,	and	leaves	us	in	a	suspended	 state	to	mourn	the
loss,	 mull	 over	 its	 meaning,	 and,	 finally,	 make	 the	 ps ychological
adjustments	and	new	plans	that	will	allow	our	lives	to	continu e.
Bereavement	is	useful;	full-blown	depression	is	not. 	William	Styron
renders	an	eloquent	description	of	“the	many	dreadfu l	manifestations
of	 the	 disease,”	 among	 them	 self-hatred,	 a	 sense	 of	 w orthlessness,	 a
“dank	joylessness”	with	“gloom	crowding	in	on	me,	a	s ense	of	dread
and	alienation	and,	above	all,	a	stifling	anxiety.” 14	Then	there	are	the
intellectual	 marks:	 “confusion,	 failure	 of	 mental	 foc us	 and	 lapse	 of
memories,”	 and,	 at	 a	 later	 stage,	 his	 mind	 “dominated	 b y	 anarchic
======================================== [Página 91] ========================================

distortions,”	and	“a	sense	that	my	thought	processes 	were	engulfed	by
a	toxic	and	unnameable	tide	that	obliterated	any	enj oyable	response
to	 the	 living	 world.”	 There	 are	 the	 physical	 effect s:	 sleeplessness,
feeling	as	listless	as	a	zombie,	“a	kind	of	numbness, 	an	enervation,	but
more	particularly	an	odd	fragility,”	along	with	a	“fidgety	re stlessness.”
Then	there	is	the	loss	of	pleasure:	“Food,	like	eve rything	else	within
the	scope	of	sensation,	was	utterly	without	savor.” 	Finally,	there	was
the	vanishing	of	hope	as	the	“gray	drizzle	of	horro r”	took	on	a	despair
so	 palpable	 it	 was	 like	 physical	 pain,	 a	 pain	 so	 un endurable	 that
suicide	seemed	a	solution.
In	 such	 major	 depression,	 life	 is	 paralyzed;	 no	 new	 beginnings
emerge.	The	very	symptoms	of	depression	bespeak	a	life 	on	hold.	For
Styron,	no	medication	or	therapy	helped;	it	was	the	 passing	of	time
and	 the	 refuge	 of	 a	 hospital	 that	 finally	 cleared	 a way	 the
despondency.	 But	 for	 most	 people,	 especially	 those	 w ith	 less	 severe
cases,	 psychotherapy	 can	 help,	 as	 can	 medication—Proz ac	 is	 the
treatment	 of	 the	 hour,	 but	 there	 are	 more	 than	 a	 doze n	 other
compounds	offering	some	help,	especially	for	major	depression .
My	 focus	 here	 is	 the	 far	 more	 common	 sadness	 that	 at	 i ts	 upper
limits	becomes,	technically	speaking,	a	“subclinical	 depression”—that
is,	ordinary	melancholy.	This	is	a	range	of	desponde ncy	that	people
can	 handle	 on	 their	 own,	 if	 they	 have	 the	 internal	 resources.
Unfortunately,	 some	 of	 the	 strategies	 most	 often	 reso rted	 to	 can
backfire,	leaving	people	feeling	worse	than	before. 	One	such	strategy
is	 simply	 staying	 alone,	 which	 is	 often	 appealing	 wh en	 people	 are
feeling	down;	more	often	than	not,	however,	it	only	 adds	a	sense	of
loneliness	and	isolation	to	the	sadness.	That	may	pa rtly	explain	why
Tice	 found	 the	 most	 popular	 tactic	 for	 battling	 depr ession	 is
socializing—going	out	to	eat,	to	a	ballgame	or	movie;	 in	short,	doing
something	with	friends	or	family.	That	works	well	if	 the	net	effect	is
to	 get	 the	 person’s	 mind	 off	 his	 sadness.	 But	 it	 simp ly	 prolongs	 the
mood	if	he	uses	the	occasion	just	to	mull	over	what	p ut	him	in	the
funk.
Indeed,	one	of	the	main	determinants	of	whether	a	dep ressed	mood
will	persist	or	lift	is	the	degree	to	which	people	 ruminate.	Worrying
about	 what’s	 depressing	 us,	 it	 seems,	 makes	 the	 depre ssion	 all	 the
more	intense	and	prolonged.	In	depression,	worry	tak es	several	forms,
all	 focusing	 on	 some	 aspect	 of	 the	 depression	 itself —how	 tired	 we
feel,	 how	 little	 energy	 or	 motivation	 we	 have,	 for	 i nstance,	 or	 how
little	 work	 we’re	 getting	 done.	 Typically	 none	 of	 t his	 reflection	 is
======================================== [Página 92] ========================================

accompanied	by	any	concrete	course	of	action	that	mig ht	alleviate	the
problem.	 Other	 common	 worries	 include	 “isolating	 yours elf	 and
thinking	about	how	terrible	you	feel,	worrying	that 	your	spouse	might
reject	you	because	you	are	depressed,	and	wondering 	whether	you	are
going	 to	 have	 another	 sleepless	 night,”	 says	 Stanfo rd	 psychologist
Susan	 Nolen-Hoeksma,	 who	 has	 studied	 rumination	 in	 de pressed
people. 15
Depressed	 people	 sometimes	 justify	 this	 kind	 of	 rumina tion	 by
saying	they	are	trying	to	“understand	themselves	bet ter”;	in	fact,	they
are	 priming	 the	 feelings	 of	 sadness	 without	 taking	 a ny	 steps	 that
might	actually	lift	their	mood.	Thus	in	therapy	it	mig ht	be	perfectly
helpful	to	reflect	deeply	on	the	causes	of	a	depres sion,	if	that	leads	to
insights	or	actions	that	will	change	the	conditions 	that	cause	it.	But	a
passive	immersion	in	the	sadness	simply	makes	it	worse.
Rumination	 can	 also	 make	 the	 depression	 stronger	 by	 c reating
conditions	that	are,	well,	more	depressing.	Nolen-Hoe ksma	gives	the
example	 of	 a	 saleswoman	 who	 gets	 depressed	 and	 spends 	 so	 many
hours	worrying	about	it	that	she	doesn’t	get	around 	to	important	sales
calls.	 Her	 sales	 then	 decline,	 making	 her	 feel	 like	 a 	 failure,	 which
feeds	 her	 depression.	 But	 if	 she	 reacted	 to	 depress ion	 by	 trying	 to
distract	herself,	she	might	well	plunge	into	the	sal es	calls	as	a	way	to
get	her	mind	off	the	sadness.	Sales	would	be	less	li kely	to	decline,	and
the	very	experience	of	making	a	sale	might	bolster	her	self-con fidence,
lessening	the	depression	somewhat.
Women,	 Nolen-Hoeksma	 finds,	 are	 far	 more	 prone	 to	 rumina te
when	 they	 are	 depressed	 than	 are	 men.	 This,	 she	 prop oses,	 may	 at
least	 partly	 explain	 the	 fact	 that	 women	 are	 diagnos ed	 with
depression	 twice	 as	 often	 as	 are	 men.	 Of	 course,	 oth er	 factors	 may
come	into	play,	such	as	women	being	more	open	to	discl osing	their
distress	or	having	more	in	their	lives	to	be	depress ed	about.	And	men
may	 drown	 their	 depression	 in	 alcoholism,	 for	 which	 t heir	 rate	 is
about	twice	that	of	women.
Cognitive	 therapy	 aimed	 at	 changing	 these	 thought	 pa tterns	 has
been	found	in	some	studies	to	be	on	a	par	with	medication	for	trea ting
mild	clinical	depression,	and	superior	to	medication	 in	preventing	the
return	of	mild	depression.	Two	strategies	are	partic ularly	effective	in
the	battle. 16	One	is	to	learn	to	challenge	the	thoughts	at	the	c enter	of
rumination—to	 question	 their	 validity	 and	 think	 of	 mor e	 positive
alternatives.	 The	 other	 is	 to	 purposely	 schedule	 pl easant,	 distracting
events.
======================================== [Página 93] ========================================

One	 reason	 distraction	 works	 is	 that	 depressing	 tho ughts	 are
automatic,	 intruding	 on	 one’s	 state	 of	 mind	 unbidden. 	 Even	 when
depressed	people	try	to	suppress	their	depressing	t houghts,	they	often
cannot	come	up	with	better	alternatives;	once	the	de pressive	tide	of
thought	has	started,	it	has	a	powerful	magnetic	effe ct	on	the	train	of
association.	 For	 example,	 when	 depressed	 people	 were 	 asked	 to
unscramble	 jumbled	 six-word	 sentences,	 they	 were	 much	 better	 at
figuring	out	the	depressing	messages	(“The	future	lo oks	very	dismal”)
than	the	upbeat	ones	(“The	future	looks	very	bright”). 17
The	 tendency	 for	 depression	 to	 perpetuate	 itself	 sh ades	 even	 the
kinds	 of	 distractions	 people	 choose.	 When	 depressed 	 people	 were
given	 a	 list	 of	 upbeat	 or	 ponderous	 ways	 to	 get	 the ir	 minds	 off
something	sad,	such	as	the	funeral	of	a	friend,	they	picked	more 	of	the
melancholy	 activities.	 Richard	 Wenzlaff,	 the	 Univers ity	 of	 Texas
psychologist	 who	 did	 these	 studies,	 concludes	 that	 people	 who	 are
already	depressed	need	to	make	a	special	effort	to	g et	their	attention
on	 something	 that	 is	 completely	 upbeat,	 being	 careful 	 not	 to
inadvertently	choose	something—a	tearjerker	movie,	a	t ragic	novel—
that	will	drag	their	mood	down	again.
Mood-lifters
Imagine	 that	 you’re	 driving	 on	 an	 unfamiliar,	 steep,	 a nd	 winding	 road	 through	 fog.
Suddenly	a	car	pulls	out	of	a	driveway	only	a	few	feet 	in	front	of	you,	too	close	for	you
to	stop	in	time.	Your	foot	slams	the	brake	to	the	floor	a nd	you	go	into	a	skid,	your	car
sliding	 into	 the	 side	 of	 the	 other	 one.	 You	 see	 that	 the	 car	 is	 full	 of	 youngsters,	 a
carpool	 on	 the	 way	 to	 preschool—just	 before	 the	 explosio n	 of	 glass	 shattering	 and
metal	bending	into	metal.	Then,	out	of	the	sudden	silence 	after	the	collision,	you	hear
a	 chorus	 of	 crying.	 You	 manage	 to	 run	 to	 the	 other	 car, 	 and	 see	 that	 one	 of	 the
children	 is	 lying	 motionless.	 You	 are	 flooded	 with	 remor se	 and	 sadness	 over	 this
tragedy.…
Such	 heart-wrenching	 scenarios	 were	 used	 to	 get	 vol unteers	 upset
in	 one	 of	 Wenzlaff’s	 experiments.	 The	 volunteers	 the n	 tried	 to	 keep
the	scene	out	of	their	minds	while	they	jotted	notes 	about	the	stream
of	 their	 thoughts	 for	 nine	 minutes.	 Each	 time	 the	 tho ught	 of	 the
disturbing	scene	intruded	into	their	minds,	they	made	a	check	ma rk	as
they	wrote.	While	most	people	thought	about	the	upse tting	scene	less
and	less	as	time	went	on,	those	volunteers	who	were	 more	depressed
actually	 showed	 a	 pronounced	 increase 	 in	 intruding	 thoughts	 of	 the
======================================== [Página 94] ========================================

scene	as	time	passed,	and	even	made	oblique	reference s	to	it	in	the
thoughts	that	were	supposed	to	be	distractions	from	it.
What’s	more,	the	depression-prone	volunteers	used	ot her	distressing
thoughts	to	distract	themselves.	As	Wenzlaff	told	me, 	“Thoughts	are
associated	in	the	mind	not	just	by	content,	but	by	mo od.	People	have
what	amounts	to	a	set	of	bad-mood	thoughts	that	come	t o	mind	more
readily	when	they	are	feeling	down.	People	who	get	 depressed	easily
tend	 to	 create	 very	 strong	 networks	 of	 association	 between	 these
thoughts,	so	that	it	is	harder	to	suppress	them	once 	some	kind	of	bad
mood	 is	 evoked.	 Ironically,	 depressed	 people	 seem	 to	 use	 one
depressing	topic	to	get	their	minds	off	another,	whi ch	only	stirs	more
negative	emotions.”
Crying,	one	theory	holds,	may	be	nature’s	way	of	low ering	levels	of
the	brain	chemicals	that	prime	distress.	While	crying 	can	sometimes
break	 a	 spell	 of	 sadness,	 it	 can	 also	 leave	 the	 per son	 still	 obsessing
about	the	reasons	for	despair.	The	idea	of	a	“good	 cry”	is	misleading:
crying	 that	 reinforces	 rumination	 only	 prolongs	 the	 misery.
Distractions	break	the	chain	of	sadness-maintaining	 thinking;	one	of
the	leading	theories	of	why	electroconvulsive	thera py	is	effective	for
the	 most	 severe	 depressions	 is	 that	 it	 causes	 a	 loss 	 of	 short-term
memory—patients	feel	better	because	they	can’t	remember	 why	they
were	so	sad.	At	any	rate,	to	shake	garden-variety	s adness,	Diane	Tice
found,	many	people	reported	turning	to	distractions	 such	as	reading,
TV	 and	 movies,	 video	 games	 and	 puzzles,	 sleeping,	 and 	 daydreams
such	as	planning	a	fantasy	vacation.	Wenzlaff	would	add	that 	the	most
effective	distractions	are	ones	that	will	shift	you r	mood—an	exciting
sporting	event,	a	funny	movie,	an	uplifting	book.	(A 	note	of	caution
here:	 Some	 distractors	 in	 themselves	 can	 perpetuate	 d epression.
Studies	 of	 heavy	 TV	 watchers	 have	 found	 that,	 after 	 watching	 TV,
they	are	generally	more	depressed	than	before	they	started!)
Aerobic	exercise,	Tice	found,	is	one	of	the	more	eff ective	tactics	for
lifting	 mild	 depression,	 as	 well	 as	 other	 bad	 moods.	 But	 the	 caveat
here	 is	 that	 the	 mood-lifting	 benefits	 of	 exercise	 w ork	 best	 for	 the
lazy,	those	who	usually	do	not	work	out	very	much.	F or	those	with	a
daily	exercise	routine,	whatever	mood-changing	benef its	it	offers	were
probably	strongest	when	they	first	took	up	the	exer cise	habit.	In	fact,
for	habitual	exercisers	there	is	a	reverse	effect	o n	mood:	they	start	to
feel	bad	on	those	days	when	they	skip	their	workout .	Exercise	seems
to	 work	 well	 because	 it	 changes	 the	 physiological	 s tate	 the	 mood
evokes:	 depression	 is	 a	 low-arousal	 state,	 and	 aero bics	 pitches	 the
======================================== [Página 95] ========================================

body	 into	 high	 arousal.	 By	 the	 same	 token,	 relaxatio n	 techniques,
which	put	the	body	into	a	low-arousal	state,	work	w ell	for	anxiety,	a
high-arousal	 state,	 but	 not	 so	 well	 for	 depression. 	 Each	 of	 these
approaches	seems	to	work	to	break	the	cycle	of	depre ssion	or	anxiety
because	it	pitches	the	brain	into	a	level	of	activi ty	incompatible	with
the	emotional	state	that	has	had	it	in	its	grip.
Cheering	 oneself	 up	 through	 treats	 and	 sensual	 plea sures	 was
another	 fairly	 popular	 antidote	 to	 the	 blues.	 Common	 ways	 people
soothed	themselves	when	depressed	ranged	from	taking	 hot	baths	or
eating	 favorite	 foods,	 to	 listening	 to	 music	 or	 havi ng	 sex.	 Buying
oneself	 a	 gift	 or	 treat	 to	 get	 out	 of	 a	 bad	 mood	 was 	 particularly
popular	 among	 women,	 as	 was	 shopping	 in	 general,	 even 	 if	 only
window-shopping.	Among	those	in	college,	Tice	found	 that	eating	was
three	times	as	common	a	strategy	for	soothing	sadness	 among	women
than	men;	men,	on	the	other	hand,	were	five	times	as	l ikely	to	turn	to
drinking	or	drugs	when	they	felt	down.	The	trouble	 with	overeating
or	 alcohol	 as	 antidotes,	 of	 course,	 is	 that	 they	 ca n	 easily	 backfire:
eating	 to	 excess	 brings	 regret;	 alcohol	 is	 a	 centra l	 nervous	 system
depressant,	and	so	only	adds	to	the	effects	of	depression	its elf.
A	 more	 constructive	 approach	 to	 mood-lifting,	 Tice	 re ports,	 is
engineering	 a	 small	 triumph	 or	 easy	 success:	 tackling 	 some	 long-
delayed	chore	around	the	house	or	getting	to	some	ot her	duty	they’ve
been	wanting	to	clear	up.	By	the	same	token,	lifts	t o	self-image	also
were	 cheering,	 even	 if	 only	 in	 the	 form	 of	 getting	 d ressed	 up	 or
putting	on	makeup.
One	of	the	most	potent—and,	outside	therapy,	little	used—antid otes
to	 depression	 is	 seeing	 things	 differently,	 or	 cognitive	refraining .	 It	 is
natural	 to	 bemoan	 the	 end	 of	 a	 relationship	 and	 to	 w allow	 in	 self-
pitying	thoughts	such	as	the	conviction	that	“this	 means	I’ll	always	be
alone,”	but	it’s	sure	to	thicken	the	sense	of	despa ir.	However,	stepping
back	 and	 thinking	 about	 the	 ways	 the	 relationship	 w asn’t	 so	 great,
and	 ways	 you	 and	 your	 partner	 were	 mismatched—in	 other 	 words,
seeing	the	loss	differently,	in	a	more	positive	ligh t—is	an	antidote	to
the	 sadness.	 By	 the	 same	 token,	 cancer	 patients,	 no	 matter	 how
serious	 their	 condition,	 were	 in	 better	 moods	 if	 the y	 were	 able	 to
bring	to	mind	another	patient	who	was	in	even	worse	 shape	(“I’m	not
so	bad	off—at	least	I	can	walk”);	those	who	compared	 themselves	to
healthy	 people	 were	 the	 most	 depressed. 18	 Such	 downward
comparisons	 are	 surprisingly	 cheering:	 suddenly	 what 	 had	 seemed
quite	dispiriting	doesn’t	look	all	that	bad.
======================================== [Página 96] ========================================

Another	 effective	 depression-lifter	 is	 helping	 othe rs	 in	 need.	 Since
depression	 feeds	 on	 ruminations	 and	 preoccupations	 w ith	 the	 self,
helping	 others	 lifts	 us	 out	 of	 those	 preoccupations 	 as	 we	 empathize
with	 people	 in	 pain	 of	 their	 own.	 Throwing	 oneself	 into	 volunteer
work—coaching	 Little	 League,	 being	 a	 Big	 Brother,	 fe eding	 the
homeless—was	 one	 of	 the	 most	 powerful	 mood-changers	 in	 Tice’s
study.	But	it	was	also	one	of	the	rarest.
Finally,	 at	 least	 some	 people	 are	 able	 to	 find	 relie f	 from	 their
melancholy	 in	 turning	 to	 a	 transcendent	 power.	 Tice	 told	 me,
“Praying,	 if	 you’re	 very	 religious,	 works	 for	 all	 mo ods,	 especially
depression.”
REPRESSORS:	UPBEAT	DENIAL
“He	kicked	his	roommate	in	the	stomach	…”	the	sentence	b egins.	It
ends,	“…	but	he	meant	to	turn	on	the	light.”
That	 transformation	 of	 an	 act	 of	 aggression	 into	 an	 innocent,	 if
slightly	 implausible,	 mistake	 is	 repression	 captured	 in	vivo .	 It	 was
composed	 by	 a	 college	 student	 who	 had	 volunteered	 fo r	 a	 study	 of
repressors ,	 people	 who	 habitually	 and	 automatically	 seem	 to	 blo t
emotional	disturbance	from	their	awareness.	The	begin ning	fragment
“He	kicked	his	roommate	in	the	stomach	…”	was	given	to	t his	student
as	 part	 of	 a	 sentence-completion	 test.	 Other	 tests	 s howed	 that	 this
small	act	of	mental	avoidance	was	part	of	a	larger	pa ttern	in	his	life,	a
pattern	 of	 tuning	 out	 most	 emotional	 upset. 19	 While	 at	 first
researchers	saw	repressors	as	a	prime	example	of	the	 inability	to	feel
emotion—cousins	 of	 alexithymics,	 perhaps—current	 thinki ng	 sees
them	as	quite	proficient	in	regulating	emotion.	They	 have	become	so
adept	at	buffering	themselves	against	negative	feeli ngs,	it	seems,	that
they	are	not	even	aware	of	the	negativity.	Rather	t han	calling	them
repressors,	 as	 has	 been	 the	 custom	 among	 researchers, 	 a	 more	 apt
term	might	be	unflappables .
Much	 of	 this	 research,	 done	 principally	 by	 Daniel	 W einberger,	 a
psychologist	 now	 at	 Case	 Western	 Reserve	 University ,	 shows	 that
while	 such	 people	 may	 seem	 calm	 and	 imperturbable,	 they 	 can
sometimes	 seethe	 with	 physiological	 upsets	 they	 are	 o blivious	 to.
During	 the	 sentence-completion	 test,	 volunteers	 were 	 also	 being
monitored	 for	 their	 level	 of	 physiological	 arousal.	 The	 repressors’
veneer	of	calm	was	belied	by	the	agitation	of	their	 bodies:	when	faced
======================================== [Página 97] ========================================

with	the	sentence	about	the	violent	roommate	and	othe rs	like	it,	they
gave	 all	 the	 signs	 of	 anxiety,	 such	 as	 a	 racing	 hea rt,	 sweating,	 and
climbing	blood	pressure.	Yet	when	asked,	they	said	t hey	felt	perfectly
calm.
This	continual	tuning-out	of	emotions	such	as	anger	 and	anxiety	is
not	uncommon:	about	one	person	in	six	shows	the	patte rn,	according
to	Weinberger.	In	theory,	children	might	learn	to	be come	unflappable
in	 any	 of	 several	 ways.	 One	 might	 be	 as	 a	 strategy	 f or	 surviving	 a
troubling	 situation	 such	 as	 having	 an	 alcoholic	 par ent	 in	 a	 family
where	the	problem	itself	is	denied.	Another	might	be	 having	a	parent
or	parents	who	are	themselves	repressors	and	so	pass 	on	the	example
of	perennial	cheerfulness	or	a	stiff	upper	lip	in	t he	face	of	disturbing
feelings.	Or	the	trait	may	simply	be	inherited	tempera ment.	While	no
one	can	say	as	yet	just	how	such	a	pattern	begins	i n	life,	by	the	time
repressors	reach	adulthood	they	are	cool	and	collected	unde r	duress.
The	question	remains,	of	course,	as	to	just	how	calm	 and	cool	they
actually	 are.	 Can	 they	 really	 be	 unaware	 of	 the	 phy sical	 signs	 of
distressing	emotions,	or	are	they	simply	feigning	cal m?	The	answer	to
that	has	come	from	clever	research	by	Richard	Davidso n,	a	University
of	Wisconsin	psychologist	and	an	early	collaborator 	with	Weinberger.
Davidson	had	people	with	the	unflappable	pattern	fr ee-associate	to	a
list	 of	 words,	 most	 neutral,	 but	 several	 with	 hostil e	 or	 sexual
meanings	 that	 stir	 anxiety	 in	 almost	 everyone.	 And,	 a s	 their	 bodily
reactions	revealed,	they	had	all	the	physiological	 signs	of	distress	in
response	to	the	loaded	words,	even	though	the	words 	they	associated
to	almost	always	showed	an	attempt	to	sanitize	the	up setting	words
by	linking	them	to	an	innocent	one.	If	the	first	wor d	was	“hate,”	the
response	might	be	“love.”
Davidson’s	 study	 took	 advantage	 of	 the	 fact	 that	 (i n	 right-handed
people)	 a	 key	 center	 for	 processing	 negative	 emotion 	 is	 in	 the	 right
half	of	the	brain,	while	the	center	for	speaking	is 	in	the	left.	Once	the
right	hemisphere	recognizes	that	a	word	is	upsetting ,	it	transmits	that
information	across	the	corpus	callosum,	the	great	div ide	between	the
brain’s	halves,	to	the	speech	center,	and	a	word	is 	spoken	in	response.
Using	an	intricate	arrangement	of	lenses,	Davidson	was	able	t o	display
a	word	so	that	it	was	seen	in	only	half	of	the	visu al	field.	Because	of
the	neural	wiring	of	the	visual	system,	if	the	displ ay	was	to	the	left
half	of	the	visual	field,	it	was	recognized	first	b y	the	right	half	of	the
brain,	 with	 its	 sensitivity	 to	 distress.	 If	 the	 dis play	 was	 to	 the	 right
half	 of	 the	 visual	 field,	 the	 signal	 went	 to	 the	 le ft	 side	 of	 the	 brain
======================================== [Página 98] ========================================

without	being	assessed	for	upset.
When	the	words	were	presented	to	the	right	hemispher e,	there	was
a	lag	in	the	time	it	took	the	unflappables	to	utter	 a	response—but	only
if	 the	 word	 they	 were	 responding	 to	 was	 one	 of	 the	 upsetting	 ones.
They	 had	no	 time	 lag	 in	 the	 speed	 of	 their	 associations	 to	 neutral
words.	The	lag	showed	up	 only	when	the	words	were	presented	to	the
right	hemisphere,	not	to	the	left.	In	short,	their	u nflappableness	seems
due	to	a	neural	mechanism	that	slows	or	interferes	with	the	tran sfer	of
upsetting	information.	The	implication	is	that	they	a re	not	faking	their
lack	 of	 awareness	 about	 how	 upset	 they	 are;	 their	 b rain	 is	 keeping
that	 information	 from	 them.	 More	 precisely,	 the	 layer	 of	 mellow
feeling	that	covers	over	such	disturbing	perception s	may	well	be	due
to	 the	 workings	 of	 the	 left	 prefrontal	 lobe.	 To	 his 	 surprise,	 when
Davidson	measured	activity	levels	in	their	prefronta l	lobes,	they	had	a
decided	 predominance	 of	 activity	 on	 the	 left—the	 cent er	 for	 good
feeling—and	less	on	the	right,	the	center	for	negativity.
These	people	“present	themselves	in	a	positive	light ,	with	an	upbeat
mood,”	 Davidson	 told	 me.	 “They	 deny	 that	 stress	 is	 up setting	 them
and	show	a	pattern	of	left	frontal	activation	while 	just	sitting	at	rest
that	is	associated	with	positive	feelings.	This	bra in	activity	may	be	the
key	 to	 their	 positive	 claims,	 despite	 the	 underlying 	 physiological
arousal	that	looks	like	distress.”	Davidson’s	theor y	is	that,	in	terms	of
brain	activity,	it	is	energy-demanding	work	to	exper ience	distressing
realities	in	a	positive	light.	The	increased	physio logical	arousal	may
be	 due	 to	 the	 sustained	 attempt	 by	 the	 neural	 circui try	 to	 maintain
positive	feelings	or	to	suppress	or	inhibit	any	negative	one s.
In	 short,	 unflappableness	 is	 a	 kind	 of	 upbeat	 denia l,	 a	 positive
dissociation—and,	 possibly,	 a	 clue	 to	 neural	 mechanis ms	 at	 play	 in
the	 more	 severe	 dissociative	 states	 that	 can	 occur	 i n,	 say,	 post-
traumatic	stress	disorder.	When	it	is	simply	involved 	in	equanimity,
says	Davidson,	“it	seems	to	be	a	successful	strategy 	for	emotional	self-
regulation”	though	with	an	unknown	cost	to	self-awareness.

The	Master	Aptitude
Just	once	in	my	life	have	I	been	paralyzed	by	fear.	The	o ccasion	was	a	calculus	exam
during	my	freshman	year	in	college	for	which	I	somehow	had	man aged	not	to	study.	I
still	remember	the	room	I	marched	to	that	spring	morning	wi th	feelings	of	doom	and
foreboding	heavy	in	my	heart.	I	had	been	in	that	lecture	 hall	for	many	classes.	This
morning,	though,	I	noticed	nothing	through	the	windows	and 	did	not	see	the	hall	at
all.	My	gaze	shrank	to	the	patch	of	floor	directly	in	fr ont	of	me	as	I	made	my	way	to	a
seat	near	the	door.	As	I	opened	the	blue	cover	of	my	ex am	book,	there	was	the	thump
in	my	ears	of	heartbeat,	there	was	the	taste	of	anxiety	 in	the	pit	of	my	stomach.
I	looked	at	the	exam	questions	once,	quickly.	Hopeles s.	For	an	hour	I	stared	at	that
page,	 my	 mind	 racing	 over	 the	 consequences	 I	 would	 suffe r.	 The	 same	 thoughts
repeated	themselves	over	and	over,	a	tape	loop	of	fear	 and	trembling.	I	sat	motionless,
like	an	animal	frozen	in	mid-move	by	curare.	What	strike s	me	most	about	that	dreadful
moment	was	how	constricted	my	mind	became.	I	did	not	spen d	the	hour	in	a	desperate
attempt	to	patch	together	some	semblance	of	answers	to	the 	test.	I	did	not	daydream.	I
simply	sat	fixated	on	my	terror,	waiting	for	the	ordeal	 to	finish.1
That	narrative	of	an	ordeal	by	terror	is	my	own;	it	 is	to	this	day	for
me	 the	 most	 convincing	 evidence	 of	 the	 devastating	 imp act	 of
emotional	 distress	 on	 mental	 clarity.	 I	 now	 see	 that	 my	 ordeal	 was
most	 likely	 a	 testament	 to	 the	 power	 of	 the	 emotional	 brain	 to
overpower,	even	paralyze,	the	thinking	brain.
The	extent	to	which	emotional	upsets	can	interfere	w ith	mental	life
is	no	news	to	teachers.	Students	who	are	anxious,	a ngry,	or	depressed
don’t	 learn;	 people	 who	 are	 caught	 in	 these	 states	 do	 not	 take	 in
information	efficiently	or	deal	with	it	well.	As	we	 saw	in	 Chapter	5 ,
powerful	 negative	 emotions	 twist	 attention	 toward	 th eir	 own
preoccupations,	 interfering	 with	 the	 attempt	 to	 focu s	 elsewhere.
Indeed,	one	of	the	signs	that	feelings	have	veered	 over	the	line	into
the	pathological	is	that	they	are	so	intrusive	they 	overwhelm	all	other
thought,	continually	sabotaging	attempts	to	pay	atte ntion	to	whatever
other	 task	 is	 at	 hand.	 For	 the	 person	 going	 through 	 an	 upsetting
divorce—or	the	child	whose	parents	are—the	mind	does	n ot	stay	long
======================================== [Página 100] ========================================

on	 the	 comparatively	 trivial	 routines	 of	 the	 work	 or 	 school	 day;	 for
the	 clinically	 depressed,	 thoughts	 of	 self-pity	 and 	 despair,
hopelessness	and	helplessness,	override	all	others.
When	emotions	overwhelm	concentration,	what	is	being	 swamped
is	the	mental	capacity	cognitive	scientists	call	“wo rking	memory,”	the
ability	to	hold	in	mind	all	information	relevant	to	t he	task	at	hand.
What	occupies	working	memory	can	be	as	mundane	as	the	 digits	that
compose	a	telephone	number	or	as	complicated	as	the	in tricate	plot
lines	 a	 novelist	 is	 trying	 to	 weave	 together.	 Worki ng	 memory	 is	 an
executive	function	par	excellence	in	mental	life,	mak ing	possible	all
other	 intellectual	 efforts,	 from	 speaking	 a	 sentence 	 to	 tackling	 a
knotty	 logical	 proposition. 2	 The	 prefrontal	 cortex	 executes	 working
memory—and,	 remember,	 is	 where	 feelings	 and	 emotions	 meet. 3
When	the	limbic	circuitry	that	converges	on	the	pref rontal	cortex	is	in
the	 thrall	 of	 emotional	 distress,	 one	 cost	 is	 in	 the 	 effectiveness	 of
working	memory:	we	can’t	think	straight,	as	I	discove red	during	that
dread	calculus	exam.
On	 the	 other	 hand,	 consider	 the	 role	 of	 positive	 mot ivation—the
marshaling	 of	 feelings	 like	 enthusiasm	 and	 confidence 	 to	 enhance
achievement.	Studies	of	Olympic	athletes,	world-class 	musicians,	and
chess	grand	masters	find	their	unifying	trait	is	the 	ability	to	motivate
themselves	to	pursue	relentless	training	routines. 4	And,	with	a	steady
rise	in	the	degree	of	excellence	required	to	be	a	world-class 	performer,
these	 rigorous	 training	 routines	 now	 increasingly	 mu st	 begin	 in
childhood.	 At	 the	 1992	 Olympics,	 twelve-year-old	 membe rs	 of	 the
Chinese	diving	team	had	put	in	as	many	total	lifetime	 practice	dives
as	 had	 members	 of	 the	 American	 team	 in	 their	 early	 twen ties—the
Chinese	divers	started	their	rigorous	training	at	age	four. 	Likewise,	the
best	 violin	 virtuosos	 of	 the	 twentieth	 century	 bega n	 studying	 their
instrument	at	around	age	five;	international	chess	c hampions	started
on	the	game	at	an	average	age	of	seven,	while	those	 who	rose	only	to
national	 prominence	 started	 at	 ten.	 Starting	 earlier 	 offers	 a	 lifetime
edge:	the	top	violin	students	at	the	best	music	acad emy	in	Berlin,	all
in	their	early	twenties,	had	put	in	ten	thousand	to tal	hours’	lifetime
practice,	while	the	second-tier	students	averaged	a round	seventy-five
hundred	hours.
What	 seems	 to	 set	 apart	 those	 at	 the	 very	 top	 of	 comp etitive
pursuits	from	others	of	roughly	equal	ability	is	the 	degree	to	which,
beginning	 early	 in	 life,	 they	 can	 pursue	 an	 arduous 	 practice	 routine
for	years	and	years.	And	that	doggedness	depends	on 	emotional	traits
======================================== [Página 101] ========================================

—enthusiasm	and	persistence	in	the	face	of	setbacks—above	all	e lse.
The	added	payoff	for	life	success	from	motivation,	ap art	from	other
innate	abilities,	can	be	seen	in	the	remarkable	perf ormance	of	Asian
students	in	American	schools	and	professions.	One	th orough	review	of
the	 evidence	 suggests	 that	 Asian-American	 children	 ma y	 have	 an
average	IQ	advantage	over	whites	of	just	two	or	thr ee	points. 5	Yet	on
the	 basis	 of	 the	 professions,	 such	 as	 law	 and	 medici ne,	 that	 many
Asian-Americans	end	up	in,	as	a	group	they	behave	as 	though	their	IQ
were	 much	 higher—the	 equivalent	 of	 an	 IQ	 of	 110	 for	 J apanese-
Americans	and	of	120	for	Chinese-Americans. 6	The	reason	seems	to	be
that	from	the	earliest	years	of	school,	Asian	childr en	work	harder	than
whites.	Sanford	Dorenbusch,	a	Stanford	sociologist	 who	studied	more
than	 ten	 thousand	 high-school	 students,	 found	 that	 Asian-Americans
spent	40	percent	more	time	doing	homework	than	did	oth er	students.
“While	 most	 American	 parents	 are	 willing	 to	 accept	 a	 child’s	 weak
areas	and	emphasize	the	strengths,	for	Asians,	the	a ttitude	is	that	if
you’re	not	doing	well,	the	answer	is	to	study	later 	at	night,	and	if	you
still	don’t	do	well,	to	get	up	and	study	earlier	in 	the	morning.	They
believe	 that	 anyone	 can	 do	 well	 in	 school	 with	 the	 right	 effort.”	 In
short,	a	strong	cultural	work	ethic	translates	into 	higher	motivation,
zeal,	and	persistence—an	emotional	edge.
To	the	degree	that	our	emotions	get	in	the	way	of	or 	enhance	our
ability	to	think	and	plan,	to	pursue	training	for	a 	distant	goal,	to	solve
problems	and	the	like,	they	define	the	limits	of	our	 capacity	to	use	our
innate	mental	abilities,	and	so	determine	how	we	do	i n	life.	And	to
the	degree	to	which	we	are	motivated	by	feelings	of	 enthusiasm	and
pleasure	in	what	we	do—or	even	by	an	optimal	degree	o f	anxiety—
they	 propel	 us	 to	 accomplishment.	 It	 is	 in	 this	 sense 	 that	 emotional
intelligence	is	a	master	aptitude,	a	capacity	that	p rofoundly	affects	all
other	abilities,	either	facilitating	or	interfering	with	t hem.
IMPULSE	CONTROL:	THE	MARSHMALLOW	TEST
Just	imagine	you’re	four	years	old,	and	someone	makes	 the	following
proposal:	If	you’ll	wait	until	after	he	runs	an	err and,	you	can	have	two
marshmallows	for	a	treat.	If	you	can’t	wait	until	the n,	you	can	have
only	one—but	you	can	have	it	right	now.	It	is	a	chal lenge	sure	to	try
the	 soul	 of	 any	 four-year-old,	 a	 microcosm	 of	 the	 ete rnal	 battle
between	 impulse	 and	 restraint,	 id	 and	 ego,	 desire	 an d	 self-control,
======================================== [Página 102] ========================================

gratification	 and	 delay.	 Which	 of	 these	 choices	 a	 c hild	 makes	 is	 a
telling	test;	it	offers	a	quick	reading	not	just	of 	character,	but	of	the
trajectory	that	child	will	probably	take	through	life.
There	 is	 perhaps	 no	 psychological	 skill	 more	 fundamen tal	 than
resisting	impulse.	It	is	the	root	of	all	emotional	se lf-control,	since	all
emotions,	by	their	very	nature,	lead	to	one	or	anoth er	impulse	to	act.
The	root	meaning	of	the	word	 emotion ,	remember,	is	“to	move.”	The
capacity	 to	 resist	 that	 impulse	 to	 act,	 to	 squelch	 t he	 incipient
movement,	 most	 likely	 translates	 at	 the	 level	 of	 brain 	 function	 into
inhibition	 of	 limbic	 signals	 to	 the	 motor	 cortex,	 tho ugh	 such	 an
interpretation	must	remain	speculative	for	now.
At	 any	 rate,	 a	 remarkable	 study	 in	 which	 the	 marshmall ow
challenge	was	posed	to	four-year-olds	shows	just	ho w	fundamental	is
the	 ability	 to	 restrain	 the	 emotions	 and	 so	 delay	 imp ulse.	 Begun	 by
psychologist	 Walter	 Mischel	 during	 the	 1960s	 at	 a	 p reschool	 on	 the
Stanford	University	campus	and	involving	mainly	child ren	of	Stanford
faculty,	 graduate	 students,	 and	 other	 employees,	 the 	 study	 tracked
down	the	four-year-olds	as	they	were	graduating	from	high	sch ool. 7
Some	 four-year-olds	 were	 able	 to	 wait	 what	 must	 surel y	 have
seemed	an	endless	fifteen	to	twenty	minutes	for	the	e xperimenter	to
return.	To	sustain	themselves	in	their	struggle	they 	covered	their	eyes
so	they	wouldn’t	have	to	stare	at	temptation,	or	res ted	their	heads	in
their	arms,	talked	to	themselves,	sang,	played	games	w ith	their	hands
and	feet,	even	tried	to	go	to	sleep.	These	plucky	p reschoolers	got	the
two-marshmallow	 reward.	 But	 others,	 more	 impulsive,	 gra bbed	 the
one	marshmallow,	almost	always	within	seconds	of	the	e xperimenter’s
leaving	the	room	on	his	“errand.”
The	diagnostic	power	of	how	this	moment	of	impulse	was 	handled
became	 clear	 some	 twelve	 to	 fourteen	 years	 later,	 whe n	 these	 same
children	were	tracked	down	as	adolescents.	The	emoti onal	and	social
difference	between	the	grab-the-marshmallow	preschool ers	and	their
gratification-delaying	 peers	 was	 dramatic.	 Those	 who 	 had	 resisted
temptation	at	four	were	now,	as	adolescents,	more	soc ially	competent:
personally	 effective,	 self-assertive,	 and	 better	 ab le	 to	 cope	 with	 the
frustrations	 of	 life.	 They	 were	 less	 likely	 to	 go	 t o	 pieces,	 freeze,	 or
regress	 under	 stress,	 or	 become	 rattled	 and	 disorgan ized	 when
pressured;	 they	 embraced	 challenges	 and	 pursued	 them	 instead	 of
giving	 up	 even	 in	 the	 face	 of	 difficulties;	 they	 we re	 self-reliant	 and
confident,	 trustworthy	 and	 dependable;	 and	 they	 too k	 initiative	 and
plunged	into	projects.	And,	more	than	a	decade	later ,	they	were	still
======================================== [Página 103] ========================================

able	to	delay	gratification	in	pursuit	of	their	goals.
The	third	or	so	who	grabbed	for	the	marshmallow,	howe ver,	tended
to	have	fewer	of	these	qualities,	and	shared	instea d	a	relatively	more
troubled	psychological	portrait.	In	adolescence	the y	were	more	likely
to	 be	 seen	 as	 shying	 away	 from	 social	 contacts;	 to	 b e	 stubborn	 and
indecisive;	to	be	easily	upset	by	frustrations;	to	 think	of	themselves	as
“bad”	or	unworthy;	to	regress	or	become	immobilized	by 	stress;	to	be
mistrustful	and	resentful	about	not	“getting	enough” ;	to	be	prone	to
jealousy	and	envy;	to	overreact	to	irritations	with 	a	sharp	temper,	so
provoking	arguments	and	fights.	And,	after	all	those 	years,	they	still
were	unable	to	put	off	gratification.
What	 shows	 up	 in	 a	 small	 way	 early	 in	 life	 blossoms	 i nto	 a	 wide
range	 of	 social	 and	 emotional	 competences	 as	 life	 goe s	 on.	 The
capacity	to	impose	a	delay	on	impulse	is	at	the	root	 of	a	plethora	of
efforts,	 from	 staying	 on	 a	 diet	 to	 pursuing	 a	 medical 	 degree.	 Some
children,	even	at	four,	had	mastered	the	basics:	the y	were	able	to	read
the	 social	 situation	 as	 one	 where	 delay	 was	 benefic ial,	 to	 pry	 their
attention	 from	 focusing	 on	 the	 temptation	 at	 hand,	 an d	 to	 distract
themselves	while	maintaining	the	necessary	perseverance	tow ard	their
goal—the	two	marshmallows.
Even	 more	 surprising,	 when	 the	 tested	 children	 were	 evaluated
again	 as	 they	 were	 finishing	 high	 school,	 those	 who 	 had	 waited
patiently	at	four	were	far	superior	 as	students 	to	those	who	had	acted
on	 whim.	 According	 to	 their	 parents’	 evaluations,	 th ey	 were	 more
academically	competent:	better	able	to	put	their	idea s	into	words,	to
use	and	respond	to	reason,	to	concentrate,	to	make	p lans	and	follow
through	on	them,	and	more	eager	to	learn.	Most	astoni shingly,	they
had	 dramatically	 higher	 scores	 on	 their	 SAT	 tests.	 T he	 third	 of
children	who	at	four	grabbed	for	the	marshmallow	most	 eagerly	had
an	average	verbal	score	of	524	and	quantitative	(or 	“math”)	score	of
528;	the	third	who	waited	longest	had	average	score s	of	610	and	652,
respectively—a	210-point	difference	in	total	score. 8
At	age	four,	how	children	do	on	this	test	of	delay	 of	gratification	is
twice	as	powerful	a	predictor	of	what	their	SAT	sco res	will	be	as	is	IQ
at	 age	 four;	 IQ	 becomes	 a	 stronger	 predictor	 of	 SAT	 only	 after
children	 learn	 to	 read. 9	 This	 suggests	 that	 the	 ability	 to	 delay
gratification	 contributes	 powerfully	 to	 intellectua l	 potential	 quite
apart	 from	 IQ	 itself.	 (Poor	 impulse	 control	 in	 childh ood	 is	 also	 a
powerful	predictor	of	later	delinquency,	again	more	 so	than	IQ. 10)	As
we	shall	see	in	Part	Five,	while	some	argue	that	IQ	 cannot	be	changed
======================================== [Página 104] ========================================

and	so	represents	an	unbendable	limitation	on	a	chil d’s	life	potential,
there	is	ample	evidence	that	emotional	skills	such	as 	impulse	control
and	accurately	reading	a	social	situation	 can	be	learned.
What	Walter	Mischel,	who	did	the	study,	describes	w ith	the	rather
infelicitous	phrase	“goal-directed	self-imposed	dela y	of	gratification”
is	perhaps	the	essence	of	emotional	self-regulation: 	the	ability	to	deny
impulse	 in	 the	 service	 of	 a	 goal,	 whether	 it	 be	 buil ding	 a	 business,
solving	 an	 algebraic	 equation,	 or	 pursuing	 the	 Stan ley	 Cup.	 His
finding	 underscores	 the	 role	 of	 emotional	 intelligen ce	 as	 a	 meta-
ability,	 determining	 how	 well	 or	 how	 poorly	 people	 a re	 able	 to	 use
their	other	mental	capacities.
FOUL	MOODS,	FOULED	THINKING
I	 worry	 about	 my	 son.	 He	 just	 started	 playing	 on	 the	 varsity	 football	 team,	 so	 he’s
bound	to	get	an	injury	sometime.	It’s	so	nerve-wracki ng	to	watch	him	play	that	I’ve
stopped	 going	 to	 his	 games.	 I’m	 sure	 my	 son	 must	 be	 disa ppointed	 that	 I’m	 not
watching	him	play,	but	it’s	simply	too	much	for	me	to	take.
The	speaker	is	in	therapy	for	anxiety;	she	realizes 	that	her	worry	is
interfering	with	leading	the	kind	of	life	she	would 	like. 11	But	when	it
comes	time	to	make	a	simple	decision,	such	as	whether	t o	watch	her
son	play	football,	her	mind	floods	with	thoughts	of	 disaster.	She	is	not
free	to	choose;	her	worries	overwhelm	her	reason.
As	we	have	seen,	worry	is	the	nub	of	anxiety’s	damag ing	effect	on
mental	 performance	 of	 all	 kind.	 Worry,	 of	 course,	 is	 in	 one	 sense	 a
useful	response	gone	awry—an	overly	zealous	mental	pr eparation	for
an	 anticipated	 threat.	 But	 such	 mental	 rehearsal	 is	 disastrous
cognitive	 static	 when	 it	 becomes	 trapped	 in	 a	 stale	 routine	 that
captures	attention,	intruding	on	all	other	attempts	to	focus 	elsewhere.
Anxiety	 undermines	 the	 intellect.	 In	 a	 complex,	 intel lectually
demanding,	 and	 high-pressure	 task	 such	 as	 that	 of	 ai r	 traffic
controllers,	for	example,	having	chronically	high	an xiety	is	an	almost
sure	predictor	that	a	person	will	eventually	fail	i n	training	or	in	the
field.	The	anxious	are	more	likely	to	fail	even	give n	superior	scores	on
intelligence	tests,	as	a	study	of	1,790	students	in 	training	for	air	traffic
control	 posts	 discovered. 12	 Anxiety	 also	 sabotages	 academic
performance	 of	 all	 kinds:	 126	 different	 studies	 of	 mo re	 than	 36,000
people	found	that	the	more	prone	to	worries	a	person 	is,	the	poorer
======================================== [Página 105] ========================================

their	 academic	 performance,	 no	 matter	 how	 measured—grade s	 on
tests,	grade-point	average,	or	achievement	tests. 13
When	 people	 who	 are	 prone	 to	 worry	 are	 asked	 to	 per form	 a
cognitive	 task	 such	 as	 sorting	 ambiguous	 objects	 int o	 one	 of	 two
categories,	and	narrate	what	is	going	through	their 	mind	as	they	do
so,	it	is	the	negative	thoughts—“I	won’t	be	able	to	 do	this,”	“I’m	just
no	 good	 at	 this	 kind	 of	 test,”	 and	 the	 like—that	 are 	 found	 to	 most
directly	 disrupt	 their	 decision-making.	 Indeed,	 when 	 a	 comparison
group	 of	 nonworriers	 was	 asked	 to	 worry	 on	 purpose	 for	 fifteen
minutes,	 their	 ability	 to	 do	 the	 same	 task	 deteriorat ed	 sharply.	 And
when	 the	 worriers	 were	 given	 a	 fifteen-minute	 relaxa tion	 session—
which	 reduced	 their	 level	 of	 worrying—before	 trying	 the	 task,	 they
had	no	problem	with	it. 14
Test	anxiety	was	first	studied	scientifically	in	th e	1960s	by	Richard
Alpert,	who	confessed	to	me	that	his	interest	was	pi qued	because	as	a
student	 his	 nerves	 often	 made	 him	 do	 poorly	 on	 tests, 	 while	 his
colleague,	 Ralph	 Haber,	 found	 that	 the	 pressure	 befo re	 an	 exam
actually	 helped	 him	 to	 do	 better. 15	 Their	 research,	 among	 other
studies,	 showed	 that	 there	 are	 two	 kinds	 of	 anxious 	 students:	 those
whose	anxiety	undoes	their	academic	performance,	and	 those	who	are
able	 to	 do	 well	 despite	 the	 stress—or,	 perhaps,	 beca use	 of	 it. 16	 The
irony	of	test	anxiety	is	that	the	very	apprehension 	about	doing	well	on
the	test	that,	ideally,	can	motivate	students	like	Ha ber	to	study	hard
in	 preparation	 and	 so	 do	 well	 can	 sabotage	 success	 in	 others.	 For
people	 who	 are	 too	 anxious,	 like	 Alpert,	 the	 pretes t	 apprehension
interferes	 with	 the	 clear	 thinking	 and	 memory	 necessa ry	 to	 study
effectively,	 while	 during	 the	 test	 it	 disrupts	 the	 mental	 clarity
essential	for	doing	well.
The	 number	 of	 worries	 that	 people	 report	 while	 takin g	 a	 test
directly	predicts	how	poorly	they	will	do	on	it. 17	The	mental	resources
expended	on	one	cognitive	task—the	worrying—simply	det ract	from
the	 resources	 available	 for	 processing	 other	 informa tion;	 if	 we	 are
preoccupied	by	worries	that	we’re	going	to	flunk	th e	test	we’re	taking,
we	 have	 that	 much	 less	 attention	 to	 expend	 on	 figuri ng	 out	 the
answers.	Our	worries	become	self-fulfilling	propheci es,	propelling	us
toward	the	very	disaster	they	predict.
People	 who	 are	 adept	 at	 harnessing	 their	 emotions,	 o n	 the	 other
hand,	 can	 use	 anticipatory	 anxiety—about	 an	 upcoming	 speech	 or
test,	say—to	motivate	themselves	to	prepare	well	for	i t,	thereby	doing
well.	The	classical	literature	in	psychology	descri bes	the	relationship
======================================== [Página 106] ========================================

between	anxiety	and	performance,	including	mental	per formance,	in
terms	 of	 an	 upside-down	 U.	 At	 the	 peak	 of	 the	 invert ed	 U	 is	 the
optimal	 relationship	 between	 anxiety	 and	 performance, 	 with	 a
modicum	of	nerves	propelling	outstanding	achievement.	 But	too	little
anxiety—the	 first	 side	 of	 the	 U—brings	 about	 apathy	 o r	 too	 little
motivation	to	try	hard	enough	to	do	well,	while	too	 much	anxiety—
the	other	side	of	the	U—sabotages	any	attempt	to	do	well.
A	mildly	elated	state— hypomania ,	as	it	is	technically	called—seems
optimal	for	writers	and	others	in	creative	callings	that	deman d	fluidity
and	imaginative	diversity	of	thought;	it	is	somewhere 	toward	the	peak
of	that	inverted	U.	But	let	that	euphoria	get	out	o f	control	to	become
outright	mania,	as	in	the	mood	swings	of	manic-depress ives,	and	the
agitation	undermines	the	ability	to	think	cohesively 	enough	to	write
well,	 even	 though	 ideas	 flow	 freely—indeed,	 much	 too	 freely	 to
pursue	any	one	of	them	far	enough	to	produce	a	finished	product .
Good	moods,	while	they	last,	enhance	the	ability	to	 think	flexibly
and	with	more	complexity,	thus	making	it	easier	to	fin d	solutions	to
problems,	whether	intellectual	or	interpersonal.	Thi s	suggests	that	one
way	to	help	someone	think	through	a	problem	is	to	tel l	them	a	joke.
Laughing,	like	elation,	seems	to	help	people	think	mo re	broadly	and
associate	 more	 freely,	 noticing	 relationships	 that	 mi ght	 have	 eluded
them	otherwise—a	mental	skill	important	not	just	in	cre ativity,	but	in
recognizing	complex	relationships	and	foreseeing	the 	consequences	of
a	given	decision.
The	intellectual	benefits	of	a	good	laugh	are	most	s triking	when	it
comes	 to	 solving	 a	 problem	 that	 demands	 a	 creative	 sol ution.	 One
study	found	that	people	who	had	just	watched	a	vide o	of	television
bloopers	were	better	at	solving	a	puzzle	long	used	 by	psychologists	to
test	creative	thinking. 18	In	the	test	people	are	given	a	candle,	matches,
and	a	box	of	tacks	and	asked	to	attach	the	candle	t o	a	corkboard	wall
so	it	will	burn	without	dripping	wax	on	the	floor.	 Most	people	given
this	problem	fall	into	“functional	fixedness,”	think ing	about	using	the
objects	 in	 the	 most	 conventional	 ways.	 But	 those	 who 	 had	 just
watched	the	funny	film,	compared	to	others	who	had	wa tched	a	film
on	math	or	who	exercised,	were	more	likely	to	see	an	 alternative	use
for	 the	 box	 holding	 the	 tacks,	 and	 so	 come	 up	 with	 t he	 creative
solution:	tack	the	box	to	the	wall	and	use	it	as	a	candleholder .
Even	 mild	 mood	 changes	 can	 sway	 thinking.	 In	 making	 pl ans	 or
decisions	 people	 in	 good	 moods	 have	 a	 perceptual	 bia s	 that	 leads
them	 to	 be	 more	 expansive	 and	 positive	 in	 their	 think ing.	 This	 is
======================================== [Página 107] ========================================

partly	because	memory	is	state-specific,	so	that	whil e	in	a	good	mood
we	 remember	 more	 positive	 events;	 as	 we	 think	 over	 the 	 pros	 and
cons	of	a	course	of	action	while	feeling	pleasant,	 memory	biases	our
weighing	of	evidence	in	a	positive	direction,	making 	us	more	likely	to
do	something	slightly	adventurous	or	risky,	for	example.
By	 the	 same	 token,	 being	 in	 a	 foul	 mood	 biases	 memory	 i n	 a
negative	 direction,	 making	 us	 more	 likely	 to	 contract 	 into	 a	 fearful,
overly	cautious	decision.	Emotions	out	of	control	imp ede	the	intellect.
But,	 as	 we	 saw	 in	 Chapter	 5 ,	 we	 can	 bring	 out-of-control	 emotions
back	 into	 line;	 this	 emotional	 competence	 is	 the	 maste r	 aptitude,
facilitating	 all	 other	 kinds	 of	 intelligence.	 Consi der	 some	 cases	 in
point:	the	benefits	of	hope	and	optimism,	and	those	s oaring	moments
when	people	outdo	themselves.
PANDORA’S	BOX	AND	POLLYANNA:	THE	POWER
OF	POSITIVE	THINKING
College	students	were	posed	the	following	hypothetical	sit uation:
Although	you	set	your	goal	of	getting	a	B,	when	your	fir st	exam	score,	worth	30%	of
your	final	grade	is	returned,	you	have	received	a	D. 	It	is	now	one	week	after	you	have
learned	about	the	D	grade.	What	do	you	do?19
Hope	made	all	the	difference.	The	response	by	studen ts	with	high
levels	of	hope	was	to	work	harder	and	think	of	a	ra nge	of	things	they
might	try	that	could	bolster	their	final	grade.	Stud ents	with	moderate
levels	of	hope	thought	of	several	ways	they	might	up 	their	grade,	but
had	 far	 less	 determination	 to	 pursue	 them.	 And,	 under standably,
students	with	low	levels	of	hope	gave	up	on	both	counts,	demora lized.
The	question	is	not	just	theoretical,	however.	When 	C.	R.	Snyder,
the	 University	 of	 Kansas	 psychologist	 who	 did	 this	 study,	 compared
the	actual	academic	achievement	of	freshman	students	h igh	and	low
on	hope,	he	discovered	that	hope	was	a	better	predi ctor	of	their	first-
semester	grades	than	were	their	scores	on	the	SAT,	a 	test	supposedly
able	to	predict	how	students	will	fare	in	college	( and	highly	correlated
with	IQ).	Again,	given	roughly	the	same	range	of	int ellectual	abilities,
emotional	aptitudes	make	the	critical	difference.
Snyder’s	 explanation:	 “Students	 with	 high	 hope	 set	 themselves
higher	goals	and	know	how	to	work	hard	to	attain	th em.	When	you
======================================== [Página 108] ========================================

compare	students	of	equivalent	intellectual	aptitude	on	the ir	academic
achievements,	what	sets	them	apart	is	hope.” 20
As	the	familiar	legend	has	it,	Pandora,	a	princess	o f	ancient	Greece,
was	given	a	gift,	a	mysterious	box,	by	gods	jealous	 of	her	beauty.	She
was	 told	 she	 must	 never	 open	 the	 gift.	 But	 one	 day,	 overcome	 by
curiosity	 and	 temptation,	 Pandora	 lifted	 the	 lid	 to	 peek	 in,	 letting
loose	 in	 the	 world	 the	 grand	 afflictions—disease,	 mal aise,	 madness.
But	a	compassionate	god	let	her	close	the	box	just	i n	time	to	capture
the	one	antidote	that	makes	life’s	misery	bearable:	hope.
Hope,	modern	researchers	are	finding,	does	more	than	o ffer	a	bit	of
solace	 amid	 affliction;	 it	 plays	 a	 surprisingly	 pote nt	 role	 in	 life,
offering	an	advantage	in	realms	as	diverse	as	school 	achievement	and
bearing	up	in	onerous	jobs.	Hope,	in	a	technical	sen se,	is	more	than
the	sunny	view	that	everything	will	turn	out	all	ri ght.	Snyder	defines
it	with	more	specificity	as	“believing	you	have	both 	the	will	and	the
way	to	accomplish	your	goals,	whatever	they	may	be.”
People	tend	to	differ	in	the	general	degree	to	which 	they	have	hope
in	this	sense.	Some	typically	think	of	themselves	as	able	to	get 	out	of	a
jam	 or	 find	 ways	 to	 solve	 problems,	 while	 others	 simpl y	 do	 not	 see
themselves	as	having	the	energy,	ability,	or	means	to 	accomplish	their
goals.	 People	 with	 high	 levels	 of	 hope,	 Snyder	 find s,	 share	 certain
traits,	 among	 them	 being	 able	 to	 motivate	 themselves,	 f eeling
resourceful	 enough	 to	 find	 ways	 to	 accomplish	 their	 objectives,
reassuring	themselves	when	in	a	tight	spot	that	thin gs	will	get	better,
being	flexible	enough	to	find	different	ways	to	get 	to	their	goals	or	to
switch	goals	if	one	becomes	impossible,	and	having	th e	sense	to	break
down	a	formidable	task	into	smaller,	manageable	pieces.
From	the	perspective	of	emotional	intelligence,	havin g	hope	means
that	one	will	not	give	in	to	overwhelming	anxiety,	a 	defeatist	attitude,
or	 depression	 in	 the	 face	 of	 difficult	 challenges	 o r	 setbacks.	 Indeed,
people	who	are	hopeful	evidence	less	depression	tha n	others	as	they
maneuver	 through	 life	 in	 pursuit	 of	 their	 goals,	 are 	 less	 anxious	 in
general,	and	have	fewer	emotional	distresses.
OPTIMISM:	THE	GREAT	MOTIVATOR
Americans	who	follow	swimming	had	high	hopes	for	Matt	 Biondi,	a
member	of	the	U.S.	Olympic	Team	in	1988.	Some	sportswrit ers	were
touting	 Biondi	 as	 likely	 to	 match	 Mark	 Spitz’s	 1972	 feat	 of	 taking
======================================== [Página 109] ========================================

seven	 gold	 medals.	 But	 Biondi	 finished	 a	 heartbreaki ng	 third	 in	 his
first	event,	the	200-meter	freestyle.	In	his	next	ev ent,	the	100-meter
butterfly,	 Biondi	 was	 inched	 out	 for	 the	 gold	 by	 an other	 swimmer
who	made	a	greater	effort	in	the	last	meter.
Sportscasters	speculated	that	the	defeats	would	dis pirit	Biondi	in	his
successive	events.	But	Biondi	rebounded	from	defeat	 and	took	a	gold
medal	in	his	next	five	events.	One	viewer	who	was	no t	surprised	by
Biondi’s	 comeback	 was	 Martin	 Seligman,	 a	 psychologist 	 at	 the
University	 of	 Pennsylvania,	 who	 had	 tested	 Biondi	 f or	 optimism
earlier	that	year.	In	an	experiment	done	with	Seligma n,	the	swimming
coach	told	Biondi	during	a	special	event	meant	to	sh owcase	Biondi’s
best	performance	that	he	had	a	worse	time	than	was	ac tually	the	case.
Despite	the	downbeat	feedback,	when	Biondi	was	asked	to	rest 	and	try
again,	his	performance—actually	already	very	good—was	 even	better.
But	when	other	team	members	who	were	given	a	false	bad 	time—and
whose	test	scores	showed	they	were	pessimistic—tried	 again,	they	did
even	worse	the	second	time. 21
Optimism,	 like	 hope,	 means	 having	 a	 strong	 expectation 	 that,	 in
general,	 things	 will	 turn	 out	 all	 right	 in	 life,	 de spite	 setbacks	 and
frustrations.	From	the	standpoint	of	emotional	intell igence,	optimism
is	 an	 attitude	 that	 buffers	 people	 against	 falling	 into	 apathy,
hopelessness,	or	depression	in	the	face	of	tough	go ing.	And,	as	with
hope,	its	near	cousin,	optimism	pays	dividends	in	lif e	(providing,	of
course,	 it	 is	 a	 realistic	 optimism;	 a	 too-naive	 optimi sm	 can	 be
disastrous). 22
Seligman	 defines	 optimism	 in	 terms	 of	 how	 people	 explai n	 to
themselves	their	successes	and	failures.	People	who	 are	optimistic	see
a	 failure	 as	 due	 to	 something	 that	 can	 be	 changed	 so 	 that	 they	 can
succeed	next	time	around,	while	pessimists	take	the	b lame	for	failure,
ascribing	it	to	some	lasting	characteristic	they	are 	helpless	to	change.
These	 differing	 explanations	 have	 profound	 implicati ons	 for	 how
people	respond	to	life.	For	example,	in	reaction	to	 a	disappointment
such	 as	 being	 turned	 down	 for	 a	 job,	 optimists	 tend	 to	 respond
actively	 and	 hopefully,	 by	 formulating	 a	 plan	 of	 act ion,	 say,	 or
seeking	out	help	and	advice;	they	see	the	setback	a s	something	that
can	 be	 remedied.	 Pessimists,	 by	 contrast,	 react	 to	 su ch	 setbacks	 by
assuming	there	is	nothing	they	can	do	to	make	things	 go	better	the
next	time,	and	so	do	nothing	about	the	problem;	they	 see	the	setback
as	due	to	some	personal	deficit	that	will	always	plague	them.
As	with	hope,	optimism	predicts	academic	success.	In	a	study	of	f ive
======================================== [Página 110] ========================================

hundred	 members	 of	 the	 incoming	 freshman	 class	 of	 1984	 at	 the
University	of	Pennsylvania,	the	students’	scores	on 	a	test	of	optimism
were	a	better	predictor	of	their	actual	grades	fres hman	year	than	were
their	 SAT	 scores	 or	 their	 high-school	 grades.	 Said	 Seligman,	 who
studied	 them,	 “College	 entrance	 exams	 measure	 talent,	 while
explanatory	 style	 tells	 you	 who	 gives	 up.	 It	 is	 the 	 combination	 of
reasonable	talent	and	the	ability	to	keep	going	in	 the	face	of	defeat
that	leads	to	success.	What’s	missing	in	tests	of	ab ility	is	motivation.
What	 you	 need	 to	 know	 about	 someone	 is	 whether	 they	 will	 keep
going	when	things	get	frustrating.	My	hunch	is	that 	for	a	given	level
of	 intelligence,	 your	 actual	 achievement	 is	 a	 functi on	 not	 just	 of
talent,	but	also	of	the	capacity	to	stand	defeat.” 23
One	of	the	most	telling	demonstrations	of	the	power	o f	optimism	to
motivate	people	is	a	study	Seligman	did	of	insurance	 salesmen	with
the	 MetLife	 company.	 Being	 able	 to	 take	 a	 rejection	 with	 grace	 is
essential	in	sales	of	all	kinds,	especially	with	a	 product	like	insurance,
where	 the	 ratio	 of	 noes	 to	 yeses	 can	 be	 so	 discoura gingly	 high.	 For
this	reason,	about	three	quarters	of	insurance	sale smen	quit	in	their
first	 three	 years.	 Seligman	 found	 that	 new	 salesmen	 w ho	 were	 by
nature	 optimists	 sold	 37	 percent	 more	 insurance	 in	 th eir	 first	 two
years	 on	 the	 job	 than	 did	 pessimists.	 And	 during	 the 	 first	 year	 the
pessimists	quit	at	twice	the	rate	of	the	optimists.
What’s	more,	Seligman	persuaded	MetLife	to	hire	a	spe cial	group	of
applicants	 who	 scored	 high	 on	 a	 test	 for	 optimism	 but 	 failed	 the
normal	screening	tests	(which	compared	a	range	of	the ir	attitudes	to	a
standard	 profile	 based	 on	 answers	 from	 agents	 who	 ha ve	 been
successful).	This	special	group	outsold	the	pessimis ts	by	21	percent	in
their	first	year,	and	57	percent	in	the	second.
Just	why	optimism	makes	such	a	difference	in	sales	suc cess	speaks
to	the	sense	in	which	it	is	an	emotionally	intellige nt	attitude.	Each	no
a	 salesperson	 gets	 is	 a	 small	 defeat.	 The	 emotional	 r eaction	 to	 that
defeat	 is	 crucial	 to	 the	 ability	 to	 marshal	 enough	 mo tivation	 to
continue.	 As	 the	 noes	 mount	 up,	 morale	 can	 deteriorat e,	 making	 it
harder	 and	 harder	 to	 pick	 up	 the	 phone	 for	 the	 next 	 call.	 Such
rejection	is	especially	hard	to	take	for	a	pessimist ,	who	interprets	it	as
meaning,	 “I’m	 a	 failure	 at	 this;	 I’ll	 never	 make	 a	 sal e”—an
interpretation	 that	 is	 sure	 to	 trigger	 apathy	 and	 d efeatism,	 if	 not
depression.	Optimists,	on	the	other	hand,	tell	themse lves,	“I’m	using
the	wrong	approach,”	or	“That	last	person	was	just	 in	a	bad	mood.”
By	seeing	not	themselves	but	something	in	the	situati on	as	the	reason
======================================== [Página 111] ========================================

for	 their	 failure,	 they	 can	 change	 their	 approach	 i n	 the	 next	 call.
While	 the	 pessimist’s	 mental	 set	 leads	 to	 despair,	 th e	 optimist’s
spawns	hope.
One	 source	 of	 a	 positive	 or	 negative	 outlook	 may	 wel l	 be	 inborn
temperament;	some	people	by	nature	tend	one	way	or	the 	other.	But
as	we	shall	also	see	in	 Chapter	14 ,	temperament	can	be	tempered	by
experience.	 Optimism	 and	 hope—like	 helplessness	 and	 de spair—can
be	 learned.	 Underlying	 both	 is	 an	 outlook	 psycholog ists	 call	self-
efficacy ,	the	belief	that	one	has	mastery	over	the	events	of 	one’s	life
and	can	meet	challenges	as	they	come	up.	Developing	a 	competency
of	 any	 kind	 strengthens	 the	 sense	 of	 self-efficacy, 	 making	 a	 person
more	willing	to	take	risks	and	seek	out	more	demanding 	challenges.
And	surmounting	those	challenges	in	turn	increases	t he	sense	of	self-
efficacy.	This	attitude	makes	people	more	likely	to	ma ke	the	best	use
of	whatever	skills	they	may	have—or	to	do	what	it	tak es	to	develop
them.
Albert	Bandura,	a	Stanford	psychologist	who	has	don e	much	of	the
research	on	self-efficacy,	sums	it	up	well:	“People’ s	beliefs	about	their
abilities	have	a	profound	effect	on	those	abilities .	Ability	is	not	a	fixed
property;	there	is	a	huge	variability	in	how	you	pe rform.	People	who
have	a	sense	of	self-efficacy	bounce	back	from	failu res;	they	approach
things	 in	 terms	 of	 how	 to	 handle	 them	 rather	 than	 wor rying	 about
what	can	go	wrong.” 24
FLOW:	THE	NEUROBIOLOGY	OF	EXCELLENCE
A	composer	describes	those	moments	when	his	work	is	at	its	best:
You	yourself	are	in	an	ecstatic	state	to	such	a	point 	that	you	feel	as	though	you	almost
don’t	exist.	I’ve	experienced	this	time	and	again.	My 	hand	seems	devoid	of	myself,	and
I	have	nothing	to	do	with	what	is	happening.	I	just	sit	 there	watching	in	a	state	of	awe
and	wonderment.	And	it	just	flows	out	by	itself.25
His	description	is	remarkably	similar	to	those	of	hundreds	of	di verse
men	 and	 women—rock	 climbers,	 chess	 champions,	 surgeons,
basketball	players,	engineers,	managers,	even	filing	clerk s—when	they
tell	 of	 a	 time	 they	 outdid	 themselves	 in	 some	 favored	 activity.	 The
state	 they	 describe	 is	 called	 “flow”	 by	 Mihaly	 Csik szentmihalyi,	 the
University	of	Chicago	psychologist	who	has	collecte d	such	accounts	of
======================================== [Página 112] ========================================

peak	 performance	 during	 two	 decades	 of	 research. 26	 Athletes	 know
this	state	of	grace	as	“the	zone,”	where	excellence 	becomes	effortless,
crowd	and	competitors	disappearing	into	a	blissful,	 steady	absorption
in	the	moment.	Diane	Roffe-Steinrotter,	who	captured	 a	gold	medal	in
skiing	at	the	1994	Winter	Olympics,	said	after	she	f inished	her	turn	at
ski	racing	that	she	remembered	nothing	about	it	but	b eing	immersed
in	relaxation:	“I	felt	like	a	waterfall.” 27
Being	able	to	enter	flow	is	emotional	intelligence	a t	its	best;	flow
represents	 perhaps	 the	 ultimate	 in	 harnessing	 the	 emo tions	 in	 the
service	of	performance	and	learning.	In	flow	the	emot ions	are	not	just
contained	 and	 channeled,	 but	 positive,	 energized,	 a nd	 aligned	 with
the	 task	 at	 hand.	 To	 be	 caught	 in	 the	 ennui	 of	 depr ession	 or	 the
agitation	of	anxiety	is	to	be	barred	from	flow.	Yet	 flow	(or	a	milder
microflow)	is	an	experience	almost	everyone	enters	fr om	time	to	time,
particularly	when	performing	at	their	peak	or	stretc hing	beyond	their
former	limits.	It	is	perhaps	best	captured	by	ecstati c	lovemaking,	the
merging	of	two	into	a	fluidly	harmonious	one.
That	experience	is	a	glorious	one:	the	hallmark	of	f low	is	a	feeling
of	 spontaneous	 joy,	 even	 rapture.	 Because	 flow	 feel s	 so	 good,	 it	 is
intrinsically	 rewarding.	 It	 is	 a	 state	 in	 which	 peo ple	 become	 utterly
absorbed	 in	 what	 they	 are	 doing,	 paying	 undivided	 a ttention	 to	 the
task,	their	awareness	merged	with	their	actions.	Ind eed,	it	interrupts
flow	to	reflect	too	much	on	what	is	happening—the	ver y	thought	“I’m
doing	 this	 wonderfully”	 can	 break	 the	 feeling	 of	 fl ow.	 Attention
becomes	so	focused	that	people	are	aware	only	of	the 	narrow	range	of
perception	 related	 to	 the	 immediate	 task,	 losing	 trac k	 of	 time	 and
space.	A	surgeon,	for	example,	recalled	a	challenging	operat ion	during
which	 he	 was	 in	 flow;	 when	 he	 completed	 the	 surgery	 he	 noticed
some	rubble	on	the	floor	of	the	operating	room	and	as ked	what	had
happened.	He	was	amazed	to	hear	that	while	he	was	so 	intent	on	the
surgery	part	of	the	ceiling	had	caved	in—he	hadn’t	noticed	at	a ll.
Flow	is	a	state	of	self-forgetfulness,	the	opposite 	of	rumination	and
worry:	instead	of	being	lost	in	nervous	preoccupati on,	people	in	flow
are	 so	 absorbed	 in	 the	 task	 at	 hand	 that	 they	 lose	 all	 self-
consciousness,	dropping	the	small	preoccupations—heal th,	bills,	even
doing	well—of	daily	life.	In	this	sense	moments	of	flo w	are	egoless.
Paradoxically,	people	in	flow	exhibit	a	masterly	con trol	of	what	they
are	doing,	their	responses	perfectly	attuned	to	the 	changing	demands
of	the	task.	And	although	people	perform	at	their	pe ak	while	in	flow,
they	 are	 unconcerned	 with	 how	 they	 are	 doing,	 with	 thoughts	 of
======================================== [Página 113] ========================================

success	 or	 failure—the	 sheer	 pleasure	 of	 the	 act	 its elf	 is	 what
motivates	them.
There	are	several	ways	to	enter	flow.	One	is	to	int entionally	focus	a
sharp	attention	on	the	task	at	hand;	a	highly	conce ntrated	state	is	the
essence	of	flow.	There	seems	to	be	a	feedback	loop	a t	the	gateway	to
this	zone:	it	can	require	considerable	effort	to	ge t	calm	and	focused
enough	 to	 begin	 the	 task—this	 first	 step	 takes	 some	 d iscipline.	 But
once	focus	starts	to	lock	in,	it	takes	on	a	force	of	its	own,	bot h	offering
relief	from	emotional	turbulence	and	making	the	task	effortles s.
Entry	to	this	zone	can	also	occur	when	people	find	 a	task	they	are
skilled	at,	and	engage	in	it	at	a	level	that	slight ly	taxes	their	ability.
As	Csikszentmihalyi	told	me,	“People	seem	to	concentra te	best	when
the	demands	on	them	are	a	bit	greater	than	usual,	and	they	are	abl e	to
give	more	than	usual.	If	there	is	too	little	demand	o n	them,	people	are
bored.	If	there	is	too	much	for	them	to	handle,	they	 get	anxious.	Flow
occurs	in	that	delicate	zone	between	boredom	and	anxiety.” 28
The	spontaneous	pleasure,	grace,	and	effectiveness	 that	characterize
flow	 are	 incompatible	 with	 emotional	 hijackings,	 in	 w hich	 limbic
surges	capture	the	rest	of	the	brain.	The	quality	o f	attention	in	flow	is
relaxed	 yet	 highly	 focused.	 It	 is	 a	 concentration	 v ery	 different	 from
straining	to	pay	attention	when	we	are	tired	or	bor ed,	or	when	our
focus	is	under	siege	from	intrusive	feelings	such	as	anxiety	o r	anger.
Flow	 is	 a	 state	 devoid	 of	 emotional	 static,	 save	 for 	 a	 compelling,
highly	motivating	feeling	of	mild	ecstasy.	That	ecsta sy	seems	to	be	a
by-product	 of	 the	 attentional	 focus	 that	 is	 a	 prere quisite	 of	 flow.
Indeed,	 the	 classic	 literature	 of	 contemplative	 trad itions	 describes
states	of	absorption	that	are	experienced	as	pure	b liss:	flow	induced
by	nothing	more	than	intense	concentration.
Watching	someone	in	flow	gives	the	impression	that	th e	difficult	is
easy;	peak	performance	appears	natural	and	ordinary. 	This	impression
parallels	what	is	going	on	within	the	brain,	where	 a	similar	paradox	is
repeated:	 the	 most	 challenging	 tasks	 are	 done	 with	 a 	 minimum
expenditure	of	mental	energy.	In	flow	the	brain	is	i n	a	“cool”	state,	its
arousal	 and	 inhibition	 of	 neural	 circuitry	 attuned	 to	 the	 demand	 of
the	 moment.	 When	 people	 are	 engaged	 in	 activities	 tha t	 effortlessly
capture	 and	 hold	 their	 attention,	 their	 brain	 “quie ts	 down”	 in	 the
sense	that	there	is	a	lessening	of	cortical	arousal .29	That	discovery	is
remarkable,	 given	 that	 flow	 allows	 people	 to	 tackle	 the	 most
challenging	tasks	in	a	given	domain,	whether	playing 	against	a	chess
master	or	solving	a	complex	mathematical	problem.	The	ex pectation
======================================== [Página 114] ========================================

would	 be	 that	 such	 challenging	 tasks	 would	 require	 more	 cortical
activity,	not	less.	But	a	key	to	flow	is	that	it	oc curs	only	within	reach
of	 the	 summit	 of	 ability,	 where	 skills	 are	 well-rehea rsed	 and	 neural
circuits	are	most	efficient.
A	 strained	 concentration—a	 focus	 fueled	 by	 worry—prod uces
increased	 cortical	 activation.	 But	 the	 zone	 of	 flow 	 and	 optimal
performance	seems	to	 be	an	oasis	 of	cortical	efficien cy,	 with	a	bare
minimum	of	mental	energy	expended.	That	makes	sense,	per haps,	in
terms	 of	 the	 skilled	 practice	 that	 allows	 people	 to	 get	 into	 flow:
having	mastered	the	moves	of	a	task,	whether	a	physic al	one	such	as
rock	climbing	or	a	mental	one	such	as	computer	programmi ng,	means
that	 the	 brain	 can	 be	 more	 efficient	 in	 performing	 th em.	 Well-
practiced	moves	require	much	less	brain	effort	than	d o	ones	just	being
learned,	or	those	that	are	still	too	hard.	Likewise ,	when	the	brain	is
working	less	efficiently	because	of	fatigue	or	nerv ousness,	as	happens
at	the	end	of	a	long,	stressful	day,	there	is	a	blu rring	of	the	precision
of	cortical	effort,	with	too	many	superfluous	areas	 being	activated—a
neural	 state	 experienced	 as	 being	 highly	 distracted .30	 The	 same
happens	 in	 boredom.	 But	 when	 the	 brain	 is	 operating	 at	 peak
efficiency,	 as	 in	 flow,	 there	 is	 a	 precise	 relation 	 between	 the	 active
areas	and	the	demands	of	the	task.	In	this	state	eve n	hard	work	can
seem	refreshing	or	replenishing	rather	than	draining.
LEARNING	AND	FLOW:	A	NEW	MODEL	FOR	EDUCATION
Because	 flow	 emerges	 in	 the	 zone	 in	 which	 an	 activit y	 challenges
people	to	the	fullest	of	their	capacities,	as	their 	skills	increase	it	takes
a	heightened	challenge	to	get	into	flow.	If	a	task	 is	too	simple,	it	is
boring;	if	too	challenging,	the	result	is	anxiety	r ather	than	flow.	It	can
be	 argued	 that	 mastery	 in	 a	 craft	 or	 skill	 is	 spurre d	 on	 by	 the
experience	 of	 flow—that	 the	 motivation	 to	 get	 better	 and	 better	 at
something,	 be	 it	 playing	 the	 violin,	 dancing,	 or	 gen e-splicing,	 is	 at
least	in	part	to	stay	in	flow	while	doing	it.	Indee d,	in	a	study	of	two
hundred	 artists	 eighteen	 years	 after	 they	 left	 art	 school,
Csikszentmihalyi	 found	 that	 it	 was	 those	 who	 in	 thei r	 student	 days
had	savored	the	sheer	joy	of	painting	itself	who	ha d	become	serious
painters.	Those	who	had	been	motivated	in	art	school 	by	dreams	of
fame	 and	 wealth	 for	 the	 most	 part	 drifted	 away	 from	 ar t	 after
graduating.
======================================== [Página 115] ========================================

Csikszentmihalyi	concludes:	“Painters	must	want	to	pa int	above	all
else.	If	the	artist	in	front	of	the	canvas	begins	t o	wonder	how	much	he
will	sell	it	for,	or	what	the	critics	will	think	of 	it,	he	won’t	be	able	to
pursue	 original	 avenues.	 Creative	 achievements	 depen d	 on	 single-
minded	immersion.” 31
Just	as	flow	is	a	prerequisite	for	mastery	in	a	craf t,	profession,	or
art,	so	too	with	learning.	Students	who	get	into	fl ow	as	they	study	do
better,	quite	apart	from	their	potential	as	measured	 by	achievement
tests.	Students	in	a	special	Chicago	high	school	fo r	the	sciences—all	of
whom	had	scored	in	the	top	5	percent	on	a	test	of	mat h	proficiency—
were	rated	by	their	math	teachers	as	high	or	low	ach ievers.	Then	the
way	 these	 students	 spent	 their	 time	 was	 monitored,	 ea ch	 student
carrying	a	beeper	that	signaled	them	at	random	times	d uring	the	day
to	write	down	what	they	were	doing	and	what	their	mo od	was.	Not
surprisingly,	the	low	achievers	spent	only	about	fi fteen	hours	a	week
studying	at	home,	much	less	than	the	twenty-seven	hou rs	a	week	of
homework	 done	 by	 their	 high-achieving	 peers.	 The	 low 	 achievers
spent	 most	 of	 the	 hours	 during	 which	 they	 were	 not	 s tudying	 in
socializing,	hanging	out	with	friends	and	family.
When	their	moods	were	analyzed,	a	telling	finding	eme rged.	Both
the	high	and	low	achievers	spent	a	great	deal	of	time 	during	the	week
being	 bored	 by	 activities,	 such	 as	 TV	 watching,	 tha t	 posed	 no
challenge	to	their	abilities.	Such,	after	all,	is	t he	lot	of	teenagers.	But
the	key	difference	 was	in	their	 experience	of	study ing.	 For	the	high
achievers,	 studying	 gave	 them	 the	 pleasing,	 absorbin g	 challenge	 of
flow	 40	 percent	 of	 the	 hours	 they	 spent	 at	 it.	 But	 for	 the	 low
achievers,	studying	produced	flow	only	16	percent	o f	the	time;	more
often	than	not,	it	yielded	anxiety,	with	the	demands 	outreaching	their
abilities.	The	low	achievers	found	pleasure	and	flo w	in	socializing,	not
in	 studying.	 In	 short,	 students	 who	 achieve	 up	 to	 t he	 level	 of	 their
academic	 potential	 and	 beyond	 are	 more	 often	 drawn	 to 	 study
because	it	puts	them	in	flow.	Sadly,	the	low	achieve rs,	by	failing	to
hone	the	skills	that	would	get	them	in	flow,	both	forfeit	the	en joyment
of	study	and	run	the	risk	of	limiting	the	level	of	i ntellectual	tasks	that
will	be	enjoyable	to	them	in	the	future. 32
Howard	 Gardner,	 the	 Harvard	 psychologist	 who	 develop ed	 the
theory	of	multiple	intelligences,	sees	flow,	and	the 	positive	states	that
typify	it,	as	part	of	the	healthiest	way	to	teach	c hildren,	motivating
them	 from	 inside	 rather	 than	 by	 threat	 or	 promise	 of	 r eward.	 “We
should	 use	 kids’	 positive	 states	 to	 draw	 them	 into	 l earning	 in	 the

domains	where	they	can	develop	competencies,”	Gardner 	proposed	to
me.	“Flow	is	an	internal	state	that	signifies	a	kid	 is	engaged	in	a	task
that’s	right.	You	have	to	find	something	you	like	an d	stick	to	it.	It’s
when	kids	get	bored	in	school	that	they	fight	and	a ct	up,	and	when
they’re	overwhelmed	by	a	challenge	that	they	get	anx ious	about	their
schoolwork.	But	you	learn	at	your	best	when	you	hav e	something	you
care	about	and	you	can	get	pleasure	from	being	engaged	in.”
The	strategy	used	in	many	of	the	schools	that	are	pu tting	Gardner’s
model	 of	 multiple	 intelligences	 into	 practice	 revolve s	 around
identifying	a	child’s	profile	of	natural	competencie s	and	playing	to	the
strengths	as	well	as	trying	to	shore	up	the	weaknes ses.	A	child	who	is
naturally	talented	in	music	or	movement,	for	example,	w ill	enter	flow
more	 easily	 in	 that	 domain	 than	 in	 those	 where	 she	 is 	 less	 able.
Knowing	a	child’s	profile	can	help	a	teacher	fine-t une	the	way	a	topic
is	presented	to	a	child	and	offer	lessons	at	the	le vel—from	remedial	to
highly	advanced—that	is	most	likely	to	provide	an	opt imal	challenge.
Doing	this	makes	learning	more	pleasurable,	neither	f earsome	nor	a
bore.	“The	hope	is	that	when	kids	gain	flow	from	lea rning,	they	will
be	 emboldened	 to	 take	 on	 challenges	 in	 new	 areas,”	 s ays	 Gardner,
adding	that	experience	suggests	this	is	the	case.
More	generally,	the	flow	model	suggests	that	achievi ng	mastery	of
any	skill	or	body	of	knowledge	should	ideally	happe n	naturally,	as	the
child	 is	 drawn	 to	 the	 areas	 that	 spontaneously	 enga ge	 her—that,	 in
essence,	she	loves.	That	initial	passion	can	be	the 	seed	for	high	levels
of	attainment,	as	the	child	comes	to	realize	that	pur suing	the	field—
whether	it	be	dance,	math,	or	music—is	a	source	of	the 	joy	of	flow.
And	since	it	takes	pushing	the	limits	of	one’s	abili ty	to	sustain	flow,
that	becomes	a	prime	motivator	for	getting	better	and	 better;	it	makes
the	child	happy.	This,	of	course,	is	a	more	positive 	model	of	learning
and	education	than	most	of	us	encountered	in	school. 	Who	does	not
recall	 school	 at	 least	 in	 part	 as	 endless	 dreary	 ho urs	 of	 boredom
punctuated	 by	 moments	 of	 high	 anxiety?	 Pursuing	 flow	 through
learning	 is	 a	 more	 humane,	 natural,	 and	 very	 likely	 mo re	 effective
way	to	marshal	emotions	in	the	service	of	education.
That	 speaks	 to	 the	 more	 general	 sense	 in	 which	 chann eling
emotions	toward	a	productive	end	is	a	master	aptitude .	Whether	it	be
in	 controlling	 impulse	 and	 putting	 off	 gratification ,	 regulating	 our
moods	 so	 they	 facilitate	 rather	 than	 impede	 thinking, 	 motivating
ourselves	 to	 persist	 and	 try,	 try	 again	 in	 the	 face 	 of	 setbacks,	 or
finding	 ways	 to	 enter	 flow	 and	 so	 perform	 more	 effect ively—all

The	Roots	of	Empathy
Back	to	Gary,	the	brilliant	but	alexithymic	surgeon	 who	so	distressed
his	fiancée,	Ellen,	by	being	oblivious	not	only	to	 his	own	feelings	but
to	hers	as	well.	Like	most	alexithymics,	he	lacked	emp athy	as	well	as
insight.	If	Ellen	spoke	of	feeling	down,	Gary	faile d	to	sympathize;	if
she	spoke	of	love,	he	changed	the	subject.	Gary	wou ld	make	“helpful”
critiques	of	things	Ellen	did,	not	realizing	these	 criticisms	made	her
feel	attacked,	not	helped.
Empathy	 builds	 on	 self-awareness;	 the	 more	 open	 we	 ar e	 to	 our
own	 emotions,	 the	 more	 skilled	 we	 will	 be	 in	 reading	 feelings. 1
Alexithymics	like	Gary,	who	have	no	idea	what	they	f eel	themselves,
are	 at	 a	 complete	 loss	 when	 it	 comes	 to	 knowing	 what	 anyone	 else
around	 them	 is	 feeling.	 They	 are	 emotionally	 tone-dea f.	 The
emotional	 notes	 and	 chords	 that	 weave	 through	 people ’s	 words	 and
actions—the	 telling	 tone	 of	 voice	 or	 shift	 in	 postur e,	 the	 eloquent
silence	or	telltale	tremble—go	by	unnoted.
Confused	 about	 their	 own	 feelings,	 alexithymics	 are	 equally
bewildered	 when	 other	 people	 express	 their	 feelings 	 to	 them.	 This
failure	 to	 register	 another’s	 feelings	 is	 a	 major	 de ficit	 in	 emotional
intelligence,	and	a	tragic	failing	in	what	it	means	 to	be	human.	For	all
rapport,	 the	 root	 of	 caring,	 stems	 from	 emotional	 attu nement,	 from
the	capacity	for	empathy.
That	capacity—the	ability	to	know	how	another	feels—c omes	into
play	 in	 a	 vast	 array	 of	 life	 arenas,	 from	 sales	 and	 management	 to
romance	 and	 parenting,	 to	 compassion	 and	 political	 ac tion.	 The
absence	 of	 empathy	 is	 also	 telling.	 Its	 lack	 is	 seen 	 in	 criminal
psychopaths,	rapists,	and	child	molesters.
People’s	emotions	are	rarely	put	into	words;	far	more 	often	they	are
expressed	through	other	cues.	The	key	to	intuiting	another’ s	feelings	is
in	the	ability	to	read	nonverbal	channels:	tone	of	 voice,	gesture,	facial
expression,	 and	 the	 like.	 Perhaps	 the	 largest	 body	 of	 research	 on
people’s	 ability	 to	 read	 such	 nonverbal	 messages	 is	 by	 Robert
Rosenthal,	 a	 Harvard	 psychologist,	 and	 his	 students. 	 Rosenthal
======================================== [Página 119] ========================================

devised	a	test	of	empathy,	the	PONS	(Profile	of	Nonverbal	Sens itivity),
a	series	of	videotapes	of	a	young	woman	expressing	f eelings	ranging
from	loathing	to	motherly	love. 2	The	scenes	span	the	spectrum	from	a
jealous	 rage	 to	 asking	 forgiveness,	 from	 a	 show	 of	 g ratitude	 to	 a
seduction.	The	video	has	been	edited	so	that	in	eac h	portrayal	one	or
more	 channels	 of	 nonverbal	 communication	 are	 systematic ally
blanked	out;	in	addition	to	having	the	words	muffled ,	for	example,	in
some	 scenes	 all	 other	 cues	 but	 the	 facial	 expression 	 are	 blocked.	 In
others,	only	the	body	movements	are	shown,	and	so	on, 	through	the
main	nonverbal	channels	of	communication,	so	that	view ers	have	to
detect	emotion	from	one	or	another	specific	nonverbal	cue.
In	tests	with	over	seven	thousand	people	in	the	Uni ted	States	and
eighteen	 other	 countries,	 the	 benefits	 of	 being	 abl e	 to	 read	 feelings
from	nonverbal	cues	included	being	better	adjusted	e motionally,	more
popular,	 more	 outgoing,	 and—perhaps	 not	 surprisingly—mo re
sensitive.	 In	 general,	 women	 are	 better	 than	 men	 at	 t his	 kind	 of
empathy.	And	people	whose	performance	improved	over	th e	course	of
the	forty-five-minute	test—a	sign	that	they	have	a	ta lent	for	picking
up	empathy	skills—also	had	better	relationships	with	the	oppo site	sex.
Empathy,	it	should	be	no	surprise	to	learn,	helps	with	romantic 	life.
In	 keeping	 with	 findings	 about	 other	 elements	 of	 emot ional
intelligence,	there	was	only	an	incidental	relation ship	between	scores
on	 this	 measure	 of	 empathic	 acuity	 and	 SAT	 or	 IQ	 scor es	 or	 school
achievement	 tests.	 Empathy’s	 independence	 from	 academic
intelligence	has	been	found	too	in	testing	with	a	v ersion	of	the	PONS
designed	for	children.	In	tests	with	1,011	children ,	those	who	showed
an	 aptitude	 for	 reading	 feelings	 nonverbally	 were	 a mong	 the	 most
popular	in	their	schools,	the	most	emotionally	stable .3	They	also	did
better	in	school,	even	though,	on	average,	their	IQ s	were	not	higher
than	 those	 of	 children	 who	 were	 less	 skilled	 at	 rea ding	 nonverbal
messages—suggesting	 that	 mastering	 this	 empathic	 abilit y	 smooths
the	 way	 for	 classroom	 effectiveness	 (or	 simply	 makes	 t eachers	 like
them	more).
Just	 as	 the	 mode	 of	 the	 rational	 mind	 is	 words,	 the	 mo de	 of	 the
emotions	is	nonverbal.	Indeed,	when	a	person’s	words 	disagree	with
what	 is	 conveyed	 via	 his	 tone	 of	 voice,	 gesture,	 or 	 other	 nonverbal
channel,	the	emotional	truth	is	in	 how	he	says	something	rather	than
in	what	he	says.	One	rule	of	thumb	used	in	communications	res earch
is	that	90	percent	or	more	of	an	emotional	message	is	 nonverbal.	And
such	 messages—anxiety	 in	 someone’s	 tone	 of	 voice,	 irri tation	 in	 the
======================================== [Página 120] ========================================

quickness	 of	 a	 gesture—are	 almost	 always	 taken	 in	 unc onsciously,
without	 paying	 specific	 attention	 to	 the	 nature	 of	 the	 message,	 but
simply	tacitly	receiving	it	and	responding.	The	skil ls	that	allow	us	to
do	this	well	or	poorly	are	also,	for	the	most	part,	learned	taci tly.
HOW	EMPATHY	UNFOLDS
The	moment	Hope,	just	nine	months	old,	saw	another	baby 	fall,	tears
welled	up	in	her	own	eyes	and	she	crawled	off	to	be 	comforted	by	her
mother,	as	though	it	were	she	who	had	been	hurt.	And 	fifteen-month-
old	Michael	went	to	get	his	own	teddy	bear	for	his	 crying	friend	Paul;
when	Paul	kept	crying,	Michael	retrieved	Paul’s	sec urity	blanket	for
him.	Both	these	small	acts	of	sympathy	and	caring	were 	observed	by
mothers	trained	to	record	such	incidents	of	empathy	i n	action. 4	 The
results	of	the	study	suggest	that	the	roots	of	empat hy	can	be	traced	to
infancy.	Virtually	from	the	day	they	are	born	infant s	are	upset	when
they	hear	another	infant	crying—a	response	some	see	a s	the	earliest
precursor	of	empathy. 5
Developmental	 psychologists	 have	 found	 that	 infants	 feel
sympathetic	 distress	 even	 before	 they	 fully	 realize	 that	 they	 exist
apart	from	other	people.	Even	a	few	months	after	birt h,	infants	react
to	a	disturbance	in	those	around	them	as	though	it	w ere	their	own,
crying	 when	 they	 see	 another	 child’s	 tears.	 By	 one	 year	 or	 so,	 they
start	to	realize	the	misery	is	not	their	own	but	some one	else’s,	though
they	 still	 seem	 confused	 over	 what	 to	 do	 about	 it.	 I n	 research	 by
Martin	L.	Hoffman	at	New	York	University,	for	example, 	a	one-year-
old	brought	his	own	mother	over	to	comfort	a	crying	f riend,	ignoring
the	friend’s	mother,	who	was	also	in	the	room.	This	c onfusion	is	seen
too	when	one-year-olds	imitate	the	distress	of	someon e	else,	possibly
to	better	comprehend	what	they	are	feeling;	for	examp le,	if	another
baby	 hurts	 her	 fingers,	 a	 one-year-old	 might	 put	 her 	 own	 fingers	 in
her	mouth	to	see	if	she	hurts,	too.	On	seeing	his	mot her	cry,	one	baby
wiped	his	own	eyes,	though	they	had	no	tears.
Such	motor	mimicry ,	as	it	is	called,	is	the	original	technical	sense	 of
the	word	empathy 	as	it	was	first	used	in	the	1920s	by	E.	B.	Titchen er,
an	 American	 psychologist.	 This	 sense	 is	 slightly	 dif ferent	 from	 its
original	introduction	into	English	from	the	Greek	 empatheia ,	 “feeling
into,”	a	term	used	initially	by	theoreticians	of	aes thetics	for	the	ability
to	 perceive	 the	 subjective	 experience	 of	 another	 pe rson.	 Titchener’s
======================================== [Página 121] ========================================

theory	was	that	empathy	stemmed	from	a	sort	of	physical 	imitation	of
the	 distress	 of	 another,	 which	 then	 evokes	 the	 same	 feelings	 in
oneself.	 He	 sought	 a	 word	 that	 would	 be	 distinct	 fro m	sympathy ,
which	 can	 be	 felt	 for	 the	 general	 plight	 of	 another 	 with	 no	 sharing
whatever	of	what	that	other	person	is	feeling.
Motor	mimicry	fades	from	toddlers’	repertoire	at	aroun d	two	and	a
half	 years,	 at	 which	 point	 they	 realize	 that	 someone 	 else’s	 pain	 is
different	 from	 their	 own,	 and	 are	 better	 able	 to	 comf ort	 them.	 A
typical	incident,	from	a	mother’s	diary:
A	neighbor’s	baby	cries	…	and	Jenny	approaches	and	tri es	to	give	him	some	cookies.
She	follows	him	around	and	begins	to	whimper	to	herself.	She 	then	tries	to	stroke	his
hair,	but	he	pulls	away.…	He	calms	down,	but	Jenny	stil l	looks	worried.	She	continues
to	bring	him	toys	and	to	pat	his	head	and	shoulders.6
At	 this	 point	 in	 their	 development	 toddlers	 begin	 to 	 diverge	 from
one	 another	 in	 their	 overall	 sensitivity	 to	 other	 p eople’s	 emotional
upsets,	with	some,	like	Jenny,	keenly	aware	and	othe rs	tuning	out.	A
series	of	studies	by	Marian	Radke-Yarrow	and	Caroly n	Zahn-Waxler	at
the	 National	 Institute	 of	 Mental	 Health	 showed	 that	 a	 large	 part	 of
this	 difference	 in	 empathic	 concern	 had	 to	 do	 with	 h ow	 parents
disciplined	their	children.	Children,	they	found,	w ere	more	empathic
when	 the	 discipline	 included	 calling	 strong	 attenti on	 to	 the	 distress
their	misbehavior	caused	someone	else:	“Look	how	sad	 you’ve	made
her	 feel”	 instead	 of	 “That	 was	 naughty.”	 They	 found 	 too	 that
children’s	 empathy	 is	 also	 shaped	 by	 seeing	 how	 othe rs	 react	 when
someone	 else	 is	 distressed;	 by	 imitating	 what	 they	 se e,	 children
develop	a	repertoire	of	empathic	response,	especiall y	in	helping	other
people	who	are	distressed.
THE	WELL-ATTUNED	CHILD
Sarah	 was	 twenty-five	 when	 she	 gave	 birth	 to	 twin	 b oys,	 Mark	 and
Fred.	 Mark,	 she	 felt,	 was	 more	 like	 herself;	 Fred	 wa s	 more	 like	 his
father.	That	perception	may	have	been	the	seed	of	a	 telling	but	subtle
difference	in	how	she	treated	each	boy.	When	the	bo ys	were	just	three
months	old,	Sarah	would	often	try	to	catch	Fred’s	ga ze,	and	when	he
would	avert	his	face,	she	would	try	to	catch	his	ey e	again;	Fred	would
respond	 by	 turning	 away	 more	 emphatically.	 Once	 she	 w ould	 look
======================================== [Página 122] ========================================

away,	 Fred	 would	 look	 back	 at	 her,	 and	 the	 cycle	 of 	 pursuit	 and
aversion	 would	 begin	 again—often	 leaving	 Fred	 in	 tea rs.	 But	 with
Mark,	 Sarah	 virtually	 never	 tried	 to	 impose	 eye	 cont act	 as	 she	 did
with	 Fred.	 Instead	 Mark	 could	 break	 off	 eye	 contact 	 whenever	 he
wanted,	and	she	would	not	pursue.
A	 small	 act,	 but	 telling.	 A	 year	 later,	 Fred	 was	 not iceably	 more
fearful	and	dependent	than	Mark;	one	way	he	showed	 his	fearfulness
was	 by	 breaking	 off	 eye	 contact	 with	 other	 people,	 as	 he	 had	 done
with	 his	 mother	 at	 three	 months,	 turning	 his	 face	 dow n	 and	 away.
Mark,	on	the	other	hand,	looked	people	straight	in	 the	eye;	when	he
wanted	to	break	off	contact,	he’d	turn	his	head	sli ghtly	upward	and	to
the	side,	with	a	winning	smile.
The	twins	and	their	mother	were	observed	so	minutely	 when	they
took	 part	 in	 research	 by	 Daniel	 Stern,	 a	 psychiatri st	 then	 at	 Cornell
University	 School	 of	 Medicine. 7	 Stern	 is	 fascinated	 by	 the	 small,
repeated	 exchanges	 that	 take	 place	 between	 parent	 a nd	 child;	 he
believes	that	the	most	basic	lessons	of	emotional	lif e	are	laid	down	in
these	 intimate	 moments.	 Of	 all	 such	 moments,	 the	 most	 cri tical	 are
those	 that	 let	 the	 child	 know	 her	 emotions	 are	 met	 wi th	 empathy,
accepted,	 and	 reciprocated,	 in	 a	 process	 Stern	 call s	attunement .	 The
twins’	 mother	 was	 attuned	 with	 Mark,	 but	 out	 of	 emoti onal	 synch
with	 Fred.	 Stern	 contends	 that	 the	 countlessly	 repe ated	 moments	 of
attunement	 or	 misattunement	 between	 parent	 and	 child	 s hape	 the
emotional	 expectations	 adults	 bring	 to	 their	 close	 r elationships—
perhaps	far	more	than	the	more	dramatic	events	of	childhood.
Attunement	 occurs	 tacitly,	 as	 part	 of	 the	 rhythm	 of	 r elationship.
Stern	 has	 studied	 it	 with	 microscopic	 precision	 thro ugh	 videotaping
hours	of	mothers	with	their	infants.	He	finds	that	th rough	attunement
mothers	let	their	infants	know	they	have	a	sense	of	 what	the	infant	is
feeling.	 A	 baby	 squeals	 with	 delight,	 for	 example,	 a nd	 the	 mother
affirms	 that	 delight	 by	 giving	 the	 baby	 a	 gentle	 sha ke,	 cooing,	 or
matching	the	pitch	of	her	voice	to	the	baby’s	squeal .	Or	a	baby	shakes
his	rattle,	and	she	gives	him	a	quick	shimmy	in	respon se.	In	such	an
interaction	 the	 affirming	 message	 is	 in	 the	 mother	 more 	 or	 less
matching	the	baby’s	level	of	excitement.	Such	small	at tunements	give
an	 infant	 the	 reassuring	 feeling	 of	 being	 emotionall y	 connected,	 a
message	that	Stern	finds	mothers	send	about	once	a	min ute	when	they
interact	with	their	babies.
Attunement	 is	 very	 different	 from	 simple	 imitation.	 “If 	 you	 just
imitate	a	baby,”	Stern	told	me,	“that	only	shows	you	 know	what	he
======================================== [Página 123] ========================================

did,	 not	 how	 he	 felt.	 To	 let	 him	 know	 you	 sense	 how	 he	 feels,	 you
have	 to	 play	 back	 his	 inner	 feelings	 in	 another	 way .	 Then	 the	 baby
knows	he	is	understood.”
Making	 love	 is	 perhaps	 the	 closest	 approximation	 in	 adult	 life	 to
this	 intimate	 attunement	 between	 infant	 and	 mother.	 Lo vemaking,
Stern	writes,	“involves	the	experience	of	sensing	t he	other’s	subjective
state:	 shared	 desire,	 aligned	 intentions,	 and	 mutual 	 states	 of
simultaneously	shifting	arousal,”	with	lovers	respon ding	to	each	other
in	a	synchrony	that	gives	the	tacit	sense	of	deep	r apport. 8	Lovemaking
is,	at	its	best,	an	act	of	mutual	empathy;	at	its	wor st	it	lacks	any	such
emotional	mutuality.
THE	COSTS	OF	MISATTUNEMENT
Stern	 holds	 that	 from	 repeated	 attunements	 an	 infant	 begins	 to
develop	a	sense	that	other	people	can	and	will	shar e	in	her	feelings.
This	 sense	 seems	 to	 emerge	 at	 around	 eight	 months,	 whe n	 infants
begin	 to	 realize	 they	 are	 separate	 from	 others,	 and	 continues	 to	 be
shaped	 by	 intimate	 relationships	 throughout	 life.	 Wh en	 parents	 are
misattuned	to	a	child	it	is	deeply	upsetting.	In	one 	experiment,	Stern
had	 mothers	 deliberately	 over-	 or	 underrespond	 to	 th eir	 infants,
rather	than	matching	them	in	an	attuned	way;	the	infa nts	responded
with	immediate	dismay	and	distress.
Prolonged	absence	of	attunement	between	parent	and	c hild	takes	a
tremendous	 emotional	 toll	 on	 the	 child.	 When	 a	 parent 	 consistently
fails	to	show	any	empathy	with	a	particular	range	of 	emotion	in	the
child—joys,	 tears,	 needing	 to	 cuddle—the	 child	 begins 	 to	 avoid
expressing,	 and	 perhaps	 even	 feeling,	 those	 same	 emot ions.	 In	 this
way,	presumably,	entire	ranges	of	emotion	can	begin	t o	be	obliterated
from	 the	 repertoire	 for	 intimate	 relations,	 especiall y	 if	 through
childhood	 those	 feelings	 continue	 to	 be	 covertly	 or 	 overtly
discouraged.
By	the	same	token,	children	can	come	to	favor	an	unfo rtunate	range
of	emotion,	depending	on	which	moods	are	reciprocated .	Even	infants
“catch”	 moods:	 Three-month-old	 babies	 of	 depressed	 mot hers,	 for
example,	 mirrored	 their	 mothers’	 moods	 while	 playing	 wi th	 them,
displaying	 more	 feelings	 of	 anger	 and	 sadness,	 and	 mu ch	 less
spontaneous	 curiosity	 and	 interest,	 compared	 to	 infa nts	 whose
mothers	were	not	depressed. 9
======================================== [Página 124] ========================================

One	mother	in	Stern’s	study	consistently	underreacte d	to	her	baby’s
level	of	activity;	eventually	her	baby	learned	to	b e	passive.	“An	infant
treated	that	way	learns,	when	I	get	excited	I	can’t	get	my	mother 	to	be
equally	excited,	so	I	may	as	well	not	try	at	all,”	S tern	contends.	But
there	is	hope	in	“reparative”	relationships:	“Relat ionships	throughout
life—with	 friends	 or	 relatives,	 for	 example,	 or	 in	 ps ychotherapy—
continually	 reshape	 your	 working	 model	 of	 relationsh ips.	 An
imbalance	at	one	point	can	be	corrected	later;	it’s	 an	ongoing,	lifelong
process.”
Indeed,	 several	 theories	 of	 psychoanalysis	 see	 the	 therapeutic
relationship	 as	 providing	 just	 such	 an	 emotional	 cor rective,	 a
reparative	 experience	 of	 attunement.	 Mirroring 	 is	 the	 term	 used	 by
some	psychoanalytic	thinkers	for	the	therapist’s	ref lecting	back	to	the
client	an	understanding	of	his	inner	state,	just	as 	an	attuned	mother
does	with	her	infant.	The	emotional	synchrony	is	uns tated	and	outside
conscious	awareness,	though	a	patient	may	bask	in	th e	sense	of	being
deeply	acknowledged	and	understood.
The	lifetime	emotional	costs	of	lack	of	attunement	in	 childhood	can
be	 great—and	 not	 just	 for	 the	 child.	 A	 study	 of	 crimi nals	 who
committed	 the	 cruelest	 and	 most	 violent	 crimes	 found	 th at	 the	 one
characteristic	 of	 their	 early	 lives	 that	 set	 them	 ap art	 from	 other
criminals	was	that	they	had	been	shuttled	from	foster 	home	to	foster
home,	or	raised	in	orphanages—life	histories	that	sug gest	emotional
neglect	and	little	opportunity	for	attunement. 10
While	 emotional	 neglect	 seems	 to	 dull	 empathy,	 there	 i s	 a
paradoxical	result	from	intense,	sustained	emotional	 abuse,	including
cruel,	 sadistic	 threats,	 humiliations,	 and	 plain	 mean ness.	 Children
who	 endure	 such	 abuse	 can	 become	 hyperalert	 to	 the	 e motions	 of
those	around	them,	in	what	amounts	to	a	post-traumatic 	vigilance	to
cues	that	have	signaled	threat.	Such	an	obsessive	p reoccupation	with
the	 feelings	 of	 others	 is	 typical	 of	 psychologicall y	 abused	 children
who	 in	 adulthood	 suffer	 the	 mercurial,	 intense	 emotio nal	 ups	 and
downs	 that	 are	 sometimes	 diagnosed	 as	 “borderline	 per sonality
disorder.”	Many	such	people	are	gifted	at	sensing	w hat	others	around
them	 are	 feeling,	 and	 it	 is	 quite	 common	 for	 them	 to	 re port	 having
suffered	emotional	abuse	in	childhood. 11
THE	NEUROLOGY	OF	EMPATHY
======================================== [Página 125] ========================================

As	 is	 so	 often	 the	 case	 in	 neurology,	 reports	 of	 qu irky	 and	 bizarre
cases	 were	 among	 the	 early	 clues	 to	 the	 brain	 basis	 of	 empathy.	 A
1975	 report,	 for	 instance,	 reviewed	 several	 cases	 i n	 which	 patients
with	certain	lesions	in	the	right	area	of	the	front al	lobes	had	a	curious
deficit:	 they	 were	 unable	 to	 understand	 the	 emotiona l	 message	 in
people’s	tone	of	voice,	though	they	were	perfectly	 able	to	understand
their	words.	A	sarcastic	“Thanks,”	a	grateful	“Than ks,”	and	an	angry
“Thanks”	all	had	the	same	neutral	meaning	for	them.	By 	contrast,	a
1979	report	spoke	of	patients	with	injuries	in	othe r	parts	of	the	right
hemisphere	 who	 had	 a	 very	 different	 gap	 in	 their	 emot ional
perception.	These	patients	were	unable	to	express	t heir	own	emotions
through	their	tone	of	voice	or	by	gesture.	They	kne w	what	they	felt,
but	they	simply	could	not	convey	it.	All	these	corti cal	brain	regions,
the	 various	 authors	 noted,	 had	 strong	 connections	 t o	 the	 limbic
system.
These	studies	were	reviewed	as	background	to	a	semin al	paper	by
Leslie	 Brothers,	 a	 psychiatrist	 at	 the	 California	 I nstitute	 of
Technology,	 on	 the	 biology	 of	 empathy. 12	 Reviewing	 both
neurological	findings	and	comparative	studies	with	a nimals,	Brothers
points	to	the	amygdala	and	its	connections	to	the	as sociation	area	of
the	 visual	 cortex	 as	 part	 of	 the	 key	 brain	 circuitr y	 underlying
empathy.
Much	 of	 the	 relevant	 neurological	 research	 is	 from	 w ork	 with
animals,	 especially	 nonhuman	 primates.	 That	 such	 primat es	 display
empathy—or	“emotional	communication,”	as	Brothers	prefers	to	sa y—
is	clear	not	just	from	anecdotal	accounts,	but	also	 from	studies	such	as
the	following:	Rhesus	monkeys	were	trained	first	to	 fear	a	certain	tone
by	hearing	it	while	they	received	an	electric	shock .	Then	they	learned
to	avoid	the	 electric	shock	by	 pushing	a	lever	 when ever	they	 heard
the	 tone.	 Next,	 pairs	 of	 these	 monkeys	 were	 put	 in	 s eparate	 cages,
their	 only	 communication	 being	 through	 closed-circuit 	 TV,	 which
allowed	them	to	see	pictures	of	the	face	of	the	othe r	monkey.	The	first
monkey,	 but	 not	 the	 second,	 then	 heard	 the	 dreaded	 t one	 sound,
which	brought	a	look	of	fear	to	its	face.	At	that	mo ment,	the	second
monkey,	 seeing	 fear	 on	 the	 face	 of	 the	 first,	 pushed 	 the	 lever	 that
prevented	the	shock—an	act	of	empathy,	if	not	of	altruism.
Having	 established	 that	 nonhuman	 primates	 do	 indeed	 re ad
emotions	 from	 the	 faces	 of	 their	 peers,	 researchers	 g ently	 inserted
long,	 fine-tipped	 electrodes	 into	 the	 brains	 of	 monk eys.	 These
electrodes	 allowed	 the	 recording	 of	 activity	 in	 a	 s ingle	 neuron.
======================================== [Página 126] ========================================

Electrodes	tapping	neurons	in	the	visual	cortex	and 	in	the	amygdala
showed	 that	 when	 one	 monkey	 saw	 the	 face	 of	 another, 	 that
information	led	to	a	neuron	firing	first	in	the	visu al	cortex,	then	in	the
amygdala.	This	pathway,	of	course,	is	a	standard	route	for	inf ormation
that	is	emotionally	arousing.	But	what	is	surprising 	about	results	from
such	 studies	 is	 that	 they	 have	 also	 identified	 neur ons	 in	 the	 visual
cortex	that	seem	to	fire	 only	in	response	to	specific	facial	expressions
or	 gestures,	 such	 as	 a	 threatening	 opening	 of	 the	 mo uth,	 a	 fearful
grimace,	or	a	docile	crouch.	These	neurons	are	disti nct	from	others	in
the	 same	 region	 that	 recognize	 familiar	 faces.	 This	 w ould	 seem	 to
mean	 that	 the	 brain	 is	 designed	 from	 the	 beginning	 to 	 respond	 to
specific	emotional	expressions—that	is,	empathy	is	a	given	of	b iology.
Another	line	of	evidence	for	the	key	role	of	the	amy gdala-cortical
pathway	in	reading	and	responding	to	emotions,	Broth ers	suggests,	is
research	 in	 which	 monkeys	 in	 the	 wild	 had	 the	 connec tions	 to	 and
from	the	amygdala	and	cortex	severed.	When	they	were	 released	back
to	 their	 troops,	 these	 monkeys	 were	 able	 to	 contend	 with	 ordinary
tasks	 such	 as	 feeding	 themselves	 and	 climbing	 trees.	 But	 the
unfortunate	monkeys	had	lost	all	sense	of	how	to	res pond	emotionally
to	 other	 monkeys	 in	 their	 band.	 Even	 when	 one	 made	 a	 friendly
approach,	 they	 would	 run	 away,	 and	 eventually	 lived 	 as	 isolates,
shunning	contact	with	their	own	troop.
The	very	regions	of	the	cortex	where	the	emotion-spe cific	neurons
concentrate	 are	 also,	 Brothers	 notes,	 those	 with	 th e	 heaviest
connection	to	the	amygdala;	reading	emotion	involves	 the	amygdala-
cortical	 circuitry,	 which	 has	 a	 key	 role	 in	 orchest rating	 the
appropriate	 responses.	 “The	 survival	 value	 of	 such	 a	 system	 is
obvious”	for	nonhuman	primates,	notes	Brothers.	“The	 perception	of
another	individual’s	approach	should	give	rise	to	a 	specific	pattern	of
[physiological	 response]—and	 very	 quickly—tailored	 to 	 whether	 the
intent	is	to	bite,	to	have	a	quiet	grooming	session,	or	to	copul ate.” 13
A	similar	physiological	basis	for	empathy	in	us	humans 	is	suggested
in	research	by	Robert	Levenson,	a	University	of	Cal ifornia	at	Berkeley
psychologist	 who	 has	 studied	 married	 couples	 trying	 to	 guess	 what
their	 partner	 is	 feeling	 during	 a	 heated	 discussion .14	 His	 method	 is
simple:	 the	 couple	 is	 videotaped	 and	 their	 physiolog ical	 responses
measured	while	talking	over	some	troubling	issue	in	t heir	marriage—
how	to	discipline	the	kids,	spending	habits,	and	th e	like.	Each	partner
reviews	 the	 tape	 and	 narrates	 what	 he	 or	 she	 was	 fe eling	 from
moment	to	moment.	Then	the	partner	reviews	the	tape	a	s econd	time,
======================================== [Página 127] ========================================

now	trying	to	read	the	 other’s 	feelings.
The	most	empathic	accuracy	occurred	in	those	husbands 	and	wives
whose	own	physiology	tracked	that	of	the	spouse 	 they	 were	 watching.
That	 is,	 when	 their	 partner	 had	 an	 elevated	 sweat	 r esponse,	 so	 did
they;	when	their	partner	had	a	drop	in	heart	rate,	 their	heart	slowed.
In	short,	their	body	mimicked	the	subtle,	moment-to-momen t	physical
reactions	of	their	spouse.	If	the	viewer’s	physiolo gical	patterns	simply
repeated	 their	 own	 during	 the	 original	 interaction, 	 they	 were	 very
poor	 at	 surmising	 what	 their	 partner	 was	 feeling.	 On ly	 when	 their
bodies	were	in	synch	was	there	empathy.
This	 suggests	 that	 when	 the	 emotional	 brain	 is	 drivi ng	 the	 body
with	a	strong	reaction—the	heat	of	anger,	say—there	c an	be	little	or
no	 empathy.	 Empathy	 requires	 enough	 calm	 and	 receptivi ty	 so	 that
the	subtle	signals	of	feeling	from	another	person	ca n	be	received	and
mimicked	by	one’s	own	emotional	brain.
EMPATHY	AND	ETHICS:	THE	ROOTS	OF	ALTRUISM
“Never	send	to	know	for	whom	the	bell	tolls;	it	toll s	for	thee”	is	one	of
the	 most	 famous	 lines	 in	 English	 literature.	 John	 Don ne’s	 sentiment
speaks	to	the	heart	of	the	link	between	empathy	and	 caring:	another’s
pain	is	one’s	own.	To	feel	with	another	is	to	care. 	In	this	sense,	the
opposite	 of	empathy 	 is	antipathy .	 The	 empathic	 attitude	 is	 engaged
again	 and	 again	 in	 moral	 judgments,	 for	 moral	 dilemmas	 i nvolve
potential	 victims:	 Should	 you	 lie	 to	 keep	 from	 hurtin g	 a	 friend’s
feelings?	Should	you	keep	a	promise	to	visit	a	sick	 friend	or	accept	a
last-minute	invitation	to	a	dinner	party	instead?	Wh en	should	a	life-
support	system	be	kept	going	for	someone	who	would	otherwise	di e?
These	moral	questions	are	posed	by	the	empathy	resear cher	Martin
Hoffman,	 who	 argues	 that	 the	 roots	 of	 morality	 are	 to	 be	 found	 in
empathy,	since	it	is	empathizing	with	the	potential	v ictims—someone
in	pain,	danger,	or	deprivation,	say—and	so	sharing	 their	distress	that
moves	 people	 to	 act	 to	 help	 them. 15	 Beyond	 this	 immediate	 link
between	 empathy	 and	 altruism	 in	 personal	 encounters,	 Hoffman
proposes	 that	 the	 same	 capacity	 for	 empathic	 affect,	 for	 putting
oneself	 in	 another’s	 place,	 leads	 people	 to	 follow	 certain	 moral
principles.
Hoffman	 sees	 a	 natural	 progression	 in	 empathy	 from	 infa ncy
onward.	As	we	have	seen,	at	one	year	of	age	a	child 	feels	in	distress
======================================== [Página 128] ========================================

herself	when	she	sees	another	fall	and	start	to	cry ;	her	rapport	is	so
strong	 and	 immediate	 that	 she	 puts	 her	 thumb	 in	 her	 mou th	 and
buries	her	head	in	her	mother’s	lap,	as	if	she	herse lf	were	hurt.	After
the	first	year,	when	infants	become	more	aware	that	t hey	are	distinct
from	others,	they	actively	try	to	soothe	another	cry ing	infant,	offering
them	 their	 teddy	 bears,	 for	 example.	 As	 early	 as	 the	 age	 of	 two,
children	begin	to	realize	that	someone	else’s	feelin gs	differ	from	their
own,	 and	 so	 they	 become	 more	 sensitive	 to	 cues	 reveal ing	 what
another	actually	feels;	at	this	point	they	might,	fo r	example,	recognize
that	another	child’s	pride	might	mean	that	the	best	w ay	to	help	them
deal	with	their	tears	is	not	to	call	undue	attention	to	them.
By	late	childhood	the	most	advanced	level	of	empathy	 emerges,	as
children	 are	 able	 to	 understand	 distress	 beyond	 the 	 immediate
situation,	and	to	see	that	someone’s	condition	or	st ation	in	life	may	be
a	source	of	chronic	distress.	At	this	point	they	ca n	feel	for	the	plight
of	an	entire	group,	such	as	the	poor,	the	oppressed ,	the	outcast.	That
understanding,	 in	 adolescence,	 can	 buttress	 moral	 co nvictions
centered	on	wanting	to	alleviate	misfortune	and	injustice.
Empathy	underlies	many	facets	of	moral	judgment	and	act ion.	One
is	“empathic	anger,”	which	John	Stuart	Mill	describe d	as	“the	natural
feeling	of	retaliation	…	rendered	by	intellect	and	s ympathy	applicable
to	 …	 those	 hurts	 which	 wound	 us	 through	 wounding	 oth ers”;	 Mill
dubbed	 this	 the	 “guardian	 of	 justice.”	 Another	 inst ance	 in	 which
empathy	 leads	 to	 moral	 action	 is	 when	 a	 bystander	 is	 moved	 to
intervene	 on	 behalf	 of	 a	 victim;	 the	 research	 shows	 that	 the	 more
empathy	a	bystander	feels	for	the	victim,	the	more	lik ely	it	is	that	she
will	 intervene.	 There	 is	 some	 evidence	 that	 the	 leve l	 of	 empathy
people	feel	shades	their	moral	judgments	as	well.	For 	example,	studies
in	 Germany	 and	 the	 United	 States	 found	 that	 the	 more	 empathic
people	 are,	 the	 more	 they	 favor	 the	 moral	 principle	 t hat	 resources
should	be	allocated	according	to	people’s	need. 16
LIFE	WITHOUT	EMPATHY:	THE	MIND	OF	THE	MOLESTER,	THE
MORALS	OF	THE	SOCIOPATH
Eric	 Eckardt	 was	 involved	 in	 an	 infamous	 crime:	 the	 b odyguard	 of
skater	 Tonya	 Harding,	 Eckardt	 had	 arranged	 to	 have	 thugs	 attack
Nancy	 Kerrigan,	 Harding’s	 archrival	 for	 the	 1994	 wome n’s	 Olympic
figure	skating	gold	medal.	In	the	attack,	Kerrigan’s 	knee	was	battered,
======================================== [Página 129] ========================================

sidelining	her	during	crucial	training	months.	But	w hen	Eckardt	saw
the	image	of	a	sobbing	Kerrigan	on	television,	he	had	a	sudden	r ush	of
remorse,	 and	 sought	 out	 a	 friend	 to	 bare	 his	 secret, 	 beginning	 the
sequence	that	led	to	the	arrest	of	the	attackers.	S uch	is	the	power	of
empathy.
But	it	is	typically,	and	tragically,	lacking	in	tho se	who	commit	the
most	mean-spirited	of	crimes.	A	psychological	fault	li ne	is	common	to
rapists,	 child	 molesters,	 and	 many	 perpetrators	 of	 fa mily	 violence
alike:	 they	 are	 incapable	 of	 empathy.	 This	 inability 	 to	 feel	 their
victims’	pain	allows	them	to	tell	themselves	lies	that 	encourage	their
crime.	For	rapists,	the	lies	include	“Women	really	wa nt	to	be	raped”
or	 “If	 she	 resists,	 she’s	 just	 playing	 hard	 to	 get” ;	 for	 molesters,	 “I’m
not	hurting	the	child,	just	showing	love”	or	“This	 is	just	another	form
of	 affection”;	 for	 physically	 abusive	 parents,	 “Thi s	 is	 just	 good
discipline.”	These	self-justifications	are	all	coll ected	from	what	people
being	treated	for	these	problems	say	they	have	told	themselves 	as	they
were	brutalizing	their	victims,	or	preparing	to	do	so.
The	 blotting	 out	 of	 empathy	 as	 these	 people	 inflict	 damage	 on
victims	is	almost	always	part	of	an	emotional	cycle	th at	precipitates
their	cruel	acts.	Witness	the	emotional	sequence	tha t	typically	leads	to
a	 sex	 crime	 such	 as	 child	 molestation. 17	 The	 cycle	 begins	 with	 the
molester	 feeling	 upset:	 angry,	 depressed,	 lonely.	 Th ese	 sentiments
might	be	triggered	by,	say,	watching	happy	couples	o n	TV,	and	then
feeling	depressed	about	being	alone.	The	molester	th en	seeks	solace	in
a	favored	fantasy,	typically	about	a	warm	friendship 	with	a	child;	the
fantasy	 becomes	 sexual	 and	 ends	 in	 masturbation.	 Afte rward,	 the
molester	 feels	 a	 temporary	 relief	 from	 the	 sadness,	 bu t	 the	 relief	 is
short-lived;	the	depression	and	loneliness	return	e ven	more	strongly.
The	 molester	 begins	 to	 think	 about	 acting	 out	 the	 fa ntasy,	 telling
himself	justifications	like	“I’m	not	doing	any	real	h arm	if	the	child	is
not	physically	hurt”	and	“If	a	child	really	didn’t	 want	to	have	sex	with
me,	she	could	stop	it.”
At	this	point	the	molester	is	seeing	the	child	throu gh	the	lens	of	the
perverted	fantasy,	not	with	empathy	for	what	a	real	 child	would	feel
in	the	situation.	That	emotional	detachment	character izes	everything
that	follows,	from	the	ensuing	plan	to	get	a	child	a lone,	to	the	careful
rehearsal	of	what	will	happen,	and	then	the	executi on	of	the	plan.	All
of	 it	 is	 pursued	 as	 though	 the	 child	 involved	 had	 n o	 feelings	 of	 her
own;	instead	the	molester	projects	on	her	the	cooper ative	attitude	of
the	child	in	his	fantasy.	Her	feelings—revulsion,	fea r,	disgust—do	not
======================================== [Página 130] ========================================

register.	If	they	did,	it	would	“ruin”	things	for	the	molester .
This	 utter	 lack	 of	 empathy	 for	 their	 victims	 is	 one	 o f	 the	 main
focuses	of	new	treatments	being	devised	for	child	mol esters	and	other
such	offenders.	In	one	of	the	most	promising	treatment 	programs,	the
offenders	read	heart-wrenching	accounts	of	crimes	li ke	their	own,	told
from	the	victim’s	perspective.	They	also	watch	videot apes	of	victims
tearfully	telling	what	it	was	like	to	be	molested.	T he	offenders	then
write	 about	 their	 own	 offense	 from	 the	 victim’s	 point 	 of	 view,
imagining	what	the	victim	felt.	They	read	this	accoun t	to	a	therapy
group,	and	try	to	answer	questions	about	the	assaul t	from	the	victim’s
perspective.	 Finally,	 the	 offender	 goes	 through	 a	 s imulated
reenactment	of	the	crime,	this	time	playing	the	role	of	the	victi m.
William	 Pithers,	 the	 Vermont	 prison	 psychologist	 who	 developed
this	 perspective-taking	 therapy,	 told	 me,	 “Empathy	 wi th	 the	 victim
shifts	perception	so	that	the	denial	of	pain,	even	 in	one’s	fantasies,	is
difficult”	 and	 so	 strengthens	 the	 men’s	 motivation	 to 	 fight	 their
perverse	 sexual	 urges.	 Sex	 offenders	 who	 have	 been	 through	 the
program	in	prison	had	only	half	the	rate	of	subseque nt	offenses	after
release	compared	to	those	who	had	no	such	treatment.	 Without	this
initial	empathy-inspired	motivation,	none	of	the	rest 	of	treatment	will
work.
While	 there	 may	 be	 some	 small	 hope	 for	 instilling	 a	 se nse	 of
empathy	in	offenders	such	as	child	molesters,	there	i s	much	less	for
another	 criminal	 type,	 the	 psychopath	 (more	 recently	 called	 the
sociopath 	 as	 a	 psychiatric	 diagnosis).	 Psychopaths	 are	 notor ious	 for
being	 both	 charming	 and	 completely	 without	 remorse	 for 	 even	 the
most	 cruel	 and	 heartless	 acts.	 Psychopathy,	 the	 inca pacity	 to	 feel
empathy	or	compassion	of	any	sort,	or	the	least	twing e	of	conscience,
is	one	of	the	more	perplexing	of	emotional	defects.	T he	heart	of	the
psychopath’s	 coldness	 seems	 to	 lie	 in	 an	 inability	 t o	 make	 anything
more	 than	 the	 shallowest	 of	 emotional	 connections.	 Th e	 cruelest	 of
criminals,	such	as	sadistic	serial	killers	who	delig ht	in	the	suffering	of
their	victims	before	they	die,	are	the	epitome	of	psychopathy. 18
Psychopaths	are	also	glib	liars,	willing	to	say	any thing	to	get	what
they	want,	and	they	manipulate	their	victims’	emotions 	with	the	same
cynicism.	 Consider	 the	 performance	 of	 Faro,	 a	 sevente en-year-old
member	of	a	Los	Angeles	gang	who	crippled	a	mother	and 	her	baby	in
a	 drive-by	 shooting,	 which	 he	 described	 with	 more	 pr ide	 than
remorse.	 Driving	 in	 a	 car	 with	 Leon	 Bing,	 who	 was	 wr iting	 a	 book
about	the	Los	Angeles	gangs	the	Crips	and	the	Blood s,	Faro	wants	to
======================================== [Página 131] ========================================

show	off.	Faro	tells	Bing	he’s	“gonna	look	crazy”	a t	the	“two	dudes”	in
the	next	car.	As	Bing	recounts	the	exchange:
The	driver,	sensing	that	someone	is	looking	at	him,	glanc es	over	at	my	car.	His	eyes
connect	 with	 Faro’s,	 widen	 for	 an	 instant.	 Then	 he	 break s	 the	 contact,	 looks	 down,
looks	away.	And	there	is	no	mistaking	what	I	saw	there	 in	his	eyes:	It	was	fear.
Faro	demonstrates	the	look	he	flashed	at	the	next	car	for	Bing:
He	looks	straight	at	me	and	everything	about	his	face	shi fts	and	changes,	as	if	by	some
trick	of	time-lapse	photography.	It	becomes	a	nightmare	fac e,	and	it	is	a	scary	thing	to
see.	It	tells	you	that	if	you	return	his	stare,	if	you	 challenge	this	kid,	you’d	better	be
able	to	stand	your	ground.	His	look	tells	you	that	he 	doesn’t	care	about	anything,	not
your	life	and	not	his.19
Of	 course,	 in	 behavior	 as	 complex	 as	 crime,	 there	 are 	 many
plausible	explanations	that	do	not	evoke	a	biologic al	basis.	One	might
be	that	a	perverse	kind	of	emotional	skill—intimidatin g	other	people
—has	 survival	 value	 in	 violent	 neighborhoods,	 as	 migh t	 turning	 to
crime;	in	these	cases	too	much	empathy	might	be	counter productive.
Indeed,	an	opportunistic	lack	of	empathy	may	be	a	“vi rtue”	in	many
roles	 in	 life,	 from	 “bad	 cop”	 police	 interrogator	 to 	 corporate	 raider.
Men	who	have	been	torturers	for	terrorist	states,	for	example ,	describe
how	 they	 learned	 to	 dissociate	 from	 the	 feelings	 of	 their	 victims	 in
order	to	do	their	“job.”	There	are	many	routes	to	manipulativen ess.
One	 of	 the	 more	 ominous	 ways	 this	 absence	 of	 empathy	 ma y
display	itself	was	discovered	by	accident	in	a	study	of	the	mos t	vicious
of	 wife	 batterers.	 The	 research	 revealed	 a	 physiolo gical	 anomaly
among	 many	 of	 the	 most	 violent	 husbands,	 who	 regularly 	 beat	 up
their	wives	or	threaten	them	with	knives	or	guns:	th e	husbands	do	so
in	a	cold,	 calculating	state	rather	 than	while	bein g	 carried	away	 by
the	heat	of	fury. 20	As	their	anger	mounts,	the	anomaly	emerges:	their
heart	rate	drops ,	instead	of	climbing	higher,	as	is	ordinarily	the	c ase
with	 mounting	 fury.	 This	 means	 they	 are	 growing	 physi ologically
calmer,	even	as	they	get	more	belligerent	and	abusive .	Their	violence
appears	to	be	a	calculated	act	of	terrorism,	a	method 	for	controlling
their	wives	by	instilling	fear.
These	 coolly	 brutal	 husbands	 are	 a	 breed	 apart	 from	 most	 other
men	who	batter	their	wives.	For	one,	they	are	far	mor e	likely	to	be
violent	 outside	 the	 marriage	 as	 well,	 getting	 into	 b ar	 fights	 and
======================================== [Página 132] ========================================

battling	with	coworkers	and	other	family	members.	And	 while	most
men	who	become	violent	with	their	wives	do	so	impulsiv ely,	out	of
rage	after	feeling	rejected	or	jealous,	or	out	of	f ear	of	abandonment,
these	calculating	batterers	will	strike	out	at	thei r	wives	seemingly	for
no	 reason	 at	 all—and	 once	 they	 start,	 nothing	 she	 do es,	 including
trying	to	leave,	seems	to	restrain	their	violence.
Some	 researchers	 who	 study	 criminal	 psychopaths	 suspe ct	 their
cold	 manipulativeness,	 such	 absence	 of	 empathy	 or	 car ing,	 can
sometimes	stem	from	a	neural	defect. *	A	possible	physiological	basis
of	heartless	psychopathy	has	been	shown	in	two	ways ,	both	of	which
suggest	 the	 involvement	 of	 neural	 pathways	 to	 the	 li mbic	 brain.	 In
one,	people’s	brain	waves	are	measured	as	they	try	t o	decipher	words
that	have	been	scrambled.	The	words	are	flashed	very 	quickly,	for	just
a	tenth	of	a	second	or	so.	Most	people	react	differ ently	to	emotional
words	such	as	kill	than	to	neutral	words	such	as	 chair: 	they	can	decide
more	quickly	if	the	emotional	word	was	scrambled,	and	 their	brains
show	a	distinctive	wave	pattern	in	response	to	the	 emotional	words,
but	 not	 the	 neutral	 ones.	 But	 psychopaths	 have	 neit her	 of	 these
responses:	their	brains	do	not	show	the	distinctive 	pattern	in	response
to	 the	 emotional	 words,	 and	 they	 do	 not	 respond	 more	 quickly	 to
them,	 suggesting	 a	 disruption	 in	 circuits	 between	 th e	 verbal	 cortex,
which	 recognizes	 the	 word,	 and	 the	 limbic	 brain,	 whi ch	 attaches
feeling	to	it.
Robert	 Hare,	 the	 University	 of	 British	 Columbia	 psych ologist	 who
has	 done	 this	 research,	 interprets	 these	 results	 as 	 meaning	 that
psychopaths	 have	 a	 shallow	 understanding	 of	 emotiona l	 words,	 a
reflection	 of	 their	 more	 general	 shallowness	 in	 the	 affective	 realm.
The	 callousness	 of	 psychopaths,	 Hare	 believes,	 is	 ba sed	 in	 part	 on
another	 physiological	 pattern	 he	 discovered	 in	 earl ier	 research,	 one
that	also	suggests	an	irregularity	in	the	workings	 of	the	amygdala	and
related	circuits:	psychopaths	about	to	receive	an	e lectrical	shock	show
no	 sign	 of	 the	 fear	 response	 that	 is	 normal	 in	 peopl e	 about	 to
experience	 pain. 21	 Because	 the	 prospect	 of	 pain	 does	 not	 trigger	 a
surge	of	anxiety,	Hare	contends	that	psychopaths	lac k	concern	about
future	punishment	for	what	they	do.	And	because	they 	themselves	do
not	feel	fear,	they	have	no	empathy—or	compassion—for	t he	fear	and
pain	of	their	victims.

The	Social	Arts
As	so	often	happens	to	five-year-olds	with	younger	 siblings,	Len	has
lost	all	patience	with	Jay,	his	two-and-a-half-year -old	brother,	who	is
making	a	mess	of	the	Lego	blocks	they’ve	been	playing 	with.	Carried
away	by	a	wave	of	rage,	Len	bites	Jay,	who	breaks	i nto	tears.	Their
mother,	 hearing	 Jay’s	 pained	 yelp,	 bustles	 over	 and	 scolds	 Len,
ordering	him	to	put	away	those	objects	of	contention ,	the	Lego	blocks.
At	 this—what	 surely	 must	 seem	 a	 gross	 miscarriage	 of	 ju stice—Len
bursts	out	crying.	Still	peeved,	his	mother	refuses	to	consol e	him.
But	 Len	 is	 proffered	 comfort	 from	 an	 unlikely	 source: 	 Jay,	 who,
although	the	original	injured	party,	is	now	so	conc erned	by	his	older
brother’s	tears	that	he	undertakes	a	campaign	to	cal m	Len	down.	The
exchange	goes	something	like	this: 1
“Len,	don’t,”	Jay	implores.	“Stop	crying,	mate.	Stop	it	crying .”
But	 Len	 still	 cries.	 His	 direct	 plea	 a	 failure,	 Jay	 beseeches	 their
mother	on	Len’s	behalf:	“Len	crying,	Mummy!	Len	crying .	Look.	Me
show	you.	Len	crying.”
And	then,	turning	to	Len,	Jay	adopts	a	mothering	mode ,	patting	his
weeping	brother	as	he	reassures	him	in	soothing	tone s,	“Look,	Len.	No
go	on	crying.”
Len’s	sobs	continue,	despite	the	comforting.	So	Jay	 turns	to	another
tactic,	lending	a	helping	hand	in	putting	away	the	 Lego	blocks	in	their
bag,	with	a	friendly,	“Ah,	Len.	I	put	it	back	for	Lennie,	hey?”
Even	so,	the	tears	continue.	The	ever-ingenious	Jay	tries	ye t	another
strategy,	distraction.	Showing	his	brother	a	toy	ca r,	Jay	tries	to	draw
his	attention	away	from	the	minor	tragedy	that	has	ju st	befallen	him.
“There’s	this	man	in	here.	What’s	this,	Len?	What’s	this,	Len? ”
Len	 takes	 no	 interest.	 He’s	 inconsolable;	 his	 tears	 know	 no	 end.
Losing	 her	 patience	 with	 him,	 his	 mother	 resorts	 to	 t hat	 classic
parental	 threat,	 “Do	 you	 want	 me	 to	 smack	 you?”	 to	 wh ich	 Len
responds	with	a	wavering,	“No.”
“Then	 just	 stop	 it,	 please,”	 says	 his	 mother	 firmly,	 if	 a	 bit
exasperatedly.
======================================== [Página 135] ========================================

Through	his	sobs,	Len	manages	a	pathetic,	gasping,	“I’m	trying 	to.”
Which	 prompts	 Jay’s	 final	 stratagem:	 borrowing	 his	 mot her’s
firmness	 and	 voice	 of	 authority,	 he	 threatens,	 “Stop 	 crying,	 Len.
Smack	your	bottom!”
This	 microdrama	 reveals	 the	 remarkable	 emotional	 sophis tication
that	 a	 toddler	 of	 just	 thirty	 months	 can	 bring	 to	 be ar	 in	 trying	 to
manage	someone	else’s	emotions.	In	his	urgent	attempts	 to	soothe	his
brother,	Jay	is	able	to	draw	on	a	large	repertoire	 of	tactics,	ranging
from	a	simple	plea,	to	seeking	an	ally	in	his	mother	( no	help,	she),	to
physically	comforting	him,	to	lending	a	helping	hand, 	to	distraction,
threats,	and	direct	commands.	No	doubt	Jay	relies	on	 an	arsenal	that
has	been	tried	with	him	in	his	own	moments	of	distress .	No	matter.
What	counts	is	that	he	can	readily	put	them	to	use	i n	a	pinch	even	at
this	very	young	age.
Of	course,	as	every	parent	of	young	children	knows, 	Jay’s	display	of
empathy	and	soothing	is	by	no	means	universal.	It	is	 perhaps	as	likely
that	 a	 child	 his	 age	 will	 see	 a	 sibling’s	 upset	 as	 a	 chance	 for
vengeance,	and	so	do	whatever	it	takes	to	make	the	u pset	even	worse.
The	 same	 skills	 can	 be	 used	 to	 tease	 or	 torment	 a	 sib ling.	 But	 even
that	mean-spiritedness	bespeaks	the	emergence	of	a	cr ucial	emotional
aptitude:	 the	 ability	 to	 know	 another’s	 feelings	 an d	 to	 act	 in	 a	 way
that	further	shapes	those	feelings.	Being	able	to	ma nage	emotions	in
someone	else	is	the	core	of	the	art	of	handling	relationships.
To	 manifest	 such	 interpersonal	 power,	 toddlers	 must	 f irst	 reach	 a
benchmark	 of	 self-control,	 the	 beginnings	 of	 the	 cap acity	 to	 damp
down	their	own	anger	and	distress,	their	impulses	an d	excitement—
even	 if	 that	 ability	 usually	 falters.	 Attunement	 to	 others	 demands	 a
modicum	of	calm	in	oneself.	Tentative	signs	of	this	ab ility	to	manage
their	own	emotions	emerge	around	this	same	period:	tod dlers	begin	to
be	able	to	wait	without	wailing,	to	argue	or	cajole 	to	get	their	way
rather	than	using	brute	force—even	if	they	don’t	alw ays	choose	to	use
this	 ability	 Patience	 emerges	 as	 an	 alternative	 to	 t antrums,	 at	 least
occasionally.	And	signs	of	empathy	emerge	by	age	two; 	it	was	Jay’s
empathy,	 the	 root	 of	 compassion,	 that	 drove	 him	 to	 try 	 so	 hard	 to
cheer	 up	 his	 sobbing	 brother,	 Len.	 Thus	 handling	 emo tions	 in
someone	else—the	fine	art	of	relationships—requires	th e	ripeness	of
two	other	emotional	skills,	self-management	and	empathy.
With	 this	 base,	 the	 “people	 skills”	 ripen.	 These	 ar e	 the	 social
competences	 that	 make	 for	 effectiveness	 in	 dealings	 w ith	 others;
deficits	 here	 lead	 to	 ineptness	 in	 the	 social	 world 	 or	 repeated
======================================== [Página 136] ========================================

interpersonal	disasters.	Indeed,	it	is	precisely	th e	lack	of	these	skills
that	 can	 cause	 even	 the	 intellectually	 brightest	 to 	 founder	 in	 their
relationships,	coming	off	as	arrogant,	obnoxious,	or 	insensitive.	These
social	 abilities	 allow	 one	 to	 shape	 an	 encounter,	 t o	 mobilize	 and
inspire	 others,	 to	 thrive	 in	 intimate	 relationships, 	 to	 persuade	 and
influence,	to	put	others	at	ease.
SHOW	SOME	EMOTION
One	key	social	competence	is	how	well	or	poorly	peop le	express	their
own	 feelings.	 Paul	 Ekman	 uses	 the	 term	 display	rules 	 for	 the	 social
consensus	about	which	feelings	can	be	properly	show n	when.	Cultures
sometimes	vary	tremendously	in	this	regard.	For	example ,	Ekman	and
colleagues	 in	 Japan	 studied	 the	 facial	 reactions	 of 	 students	 to	 a
horrific	film	about	ritual	circumcisions	of	teenage	A borigines.	When
the	 Japanese	 students	 watched	 the	 film	 with	 an	 autho rity	 figure
present,	 their	 faces	 showed	 only	 the	 slightest	 hint s	 of	 reaction.	 But
when	they	thought	they	were	alone	(though	they	were 	being	taped	by
a	 secret	 camera)	 their	 faces	 twisted	 into	 vivid	 mixes 	 of	 anguished
distress,	dread,	and	disgust.
There	are	several	basic	kinds	of	display	rules. 2	One	is	minimizing 	the
show	of	emotion—this	is	the	Japanese	norm	for	feelings 	of	distress	in
the	 presence	 of	 someone	 in	 authority,	 which	 the	 stud ents	 were
following	when	they	masked	their	upset	with	a	poker	 face.	Another	is
exaggerating 	what	one	feels	by	magnifying	the	emotional	expressio n;
this	is	the	ploy	used	by	the	six-year-old	who	dramat ically	twists	her
face	into	a	pathetic	frown,	lips	quivering,	as	she	 runs	to	complain	to
her	 mother	 about	 being	 teased	 by	 her	 older	 brother.	 A	 third	 is
substituting 	one	feeling	for	another;	this	comes	into	play	in	so me	Asian
cultures	 where	 it	 is	 impolite	 to	 say	 no,	 and	 positiv e	 (but	 false)
assurances	are	given	instead.	How	well	one	employs	t hese	strategies,
and	knows	when	to	do	so,	is	one	factor	in	emotional	intelligenc e.
We	 learn	 these	 display	 rules	 very	 early,	 partly	 by	 explicit
instruction.	 An	 education	 in	 display	 rules	 is	 impart ed	 when	 we
instruct	a	child	not	to	seem	disappointed,	but	to	smi le	and	say	thank
you	 instead,	 when	 Grandpa	 has	 given	 a	 dreadful	 but	 well-meant
birthday	 present.	 This	 education	 in	 display	 rules,	 though,	 is	 more
often	through	modeling:	children	learn	to	do	what	th ey	see	done.	In
educating	 the	 sentiments,	 emotions	 are	 both	 the	 medium	 and	 the
======================================== [Página 137] ========================================

message.	If	a	child	is	told	to	“smile	and	say	thank	y ou”	by	a	parent
who	is,	at	that	moment,	harsh,	demanding,	and	cold—who	 hisses	the
message	instead	of	warmly	whispering	it—the	child	is	mo re	likely	to
learn	a	very	different	lesson,	and	in	fact	respond	 to	Grandpa	with	a
frown	 and	 a	 curt,	 flat	 “Thank	 you.”	 The	 effect	 on	 G randpa	 is	 very
different:	in	the	first	case	he’s	happy	(though	misl ed);	in	the	second
he’s	hurt	by	the	mixed	message.
Emotional	displays,	of	course,	have	immediate	conseque nces	in	the
impact	they	make	on	the	person	who	receives	them.	The	 rule	being
learned	by	the	child	is	something	like,	“Mask	your	r eal	feelings	when
they	will	hurt	someone	you	love;	substitute	a	phony, 	but	less	hurtful
feeling	 instead.”	 Such	 rules	 for	 expressing	 emotions 	 are	 more	 than
part	 of	 the	 lexicon	 of	 social	 propriety;	 they	 dicta te	 how	 our	 own
feelings	impact	on	everyone	else.	To	follow	these	ru les	well	is	to	have
optimal	impact;	to	do	so	poorly	is	to	foment	emotional	havoc.
Actors,	 of	 course,	 are	 artists	 of	 the	 emotional	 disp lay;	 their
expressiveness	 is	 what	 evokes	 response	 in	 their	 aud ience.	 And,	 no
doubt,	some	of	us	come	into	life	as	natural	actors.	B ut	partly	because
the	lessons	we	learn	about	display	rules	vary	accor ding	to	the	models
we’ve	had,	people	differ	greatly	in	their	adeptness.
EXPRESSIVENESS	AND	EMOTIONAL	CONTAGION
It	 was	 early	 in	 the	 Vietnam	 War,	 and	 an	 American	 plat oon	 was
hunkered	down	in	some	rice	paddies,	in	the	heat	of	a 	firefight	with
the	Vietcong.	Suddenly	a	line	of	six	monks	started	w alking	along	the
elevated	berms	that	separated	paddy	from	paddy.	Perfe ctly	calm	and
poised,	the	monks	walked	directly	toward	the	line	of	fire.
“They	didn’t	look	right,	they	didn’t	look	left.	The y	walked	straight
through,”	recalls	David	Busch,	one	of	the	American	s oldiers.	“It	was
really	 strange,	 because	 nobody	 shot	 at	 ’em.	 And	 afte r	 they	 walked
over	the	berm,	suddenly	all	the	fight	was	out	of	me.	 It	just	didn’t	feel
like	I	wanted	to	do	this	anymore,	at	least	not	that	 day.	It	must	have
been	 that	 way	 for	 everybody,	 because	 everybody	 quit .	 We	 just
stopped	fighting.” 3
The	power	of	the	monks’	quietly	courageous	calm	to	pa cify	soldiers
in	the	heat	of	battle	illustrates	a	basic	principle	of	social 	life:	Emotions
are	 contagious.	 To	 be	 sure,	 this	 tale	 marks	 an	 extre me.	 Most
emotional	contagion	is	far	more	subtle,	part	of	a	tac it	exchange	that
======================================== [Página 138] ========================================

happens	in	every	encounter.	We	transmit	and	catch	moo ds	from	each
other	 in	 what	 amounts	 to	 a	 subterranean	 economy	 of	 th e	 psyche	 in
which	 some	 encounters	 are	 toxic,	 some	 nourishing.	 Thi s	 emotional
exchange	is	typically	at	a	subtle,	almost	imperceptible	level ;	the	way	a
salesperson	says	thank	you	can	leave	us	feeling	ign ored,	resented,	or
genuinely	 welcomed	 and	 appreciated.	 We	 catch	 feeling s	 from	 one
another	as	though	they	were	some	kind	of	social	virus.
We	 send	 emotional	 signals	 in	 every	 encounter,	 and	 th ose	 signals
affect	those	we	are	with.	The	more	adroit	we	are	soc ially,	the	better
we	control	the	signals	we	send;	the	reserve	of	poli te	society	is,	after
all,	 simply	 a	 means	 to	 ensure	 that	 no	 disturbing	 emoti onal	 leakage
will	unsettle	the	encounter	(a	social	rule	that,	wh en	brought	into	the
domain	 of	 intimate	 relationships,	 is	 stifling).	 Emotio nal	 intelligence
includes	managing	this	exchange;	“popular”	and	“char ming”	are	terms
we	use	for	people	whom	we	like	to	be	with	because	th eir	emotional
skills	make	us	feel	good.	People	who	are	able	to	hel p	others	soothe
their	 feelings	 have	 an	 especially	 valued	 social	 commo dity;	 they	 are
the	souls	others	turn	to	when	in	greatest	emotional	 need.	We	are	all
part	 of	 each	 other’s	 tool	 kit	 for	 emotional	 change,	 for	 better	 or	 for
worse.
Consider	 a	 remarkable	 demonstration	 of	 the	 subtlety	 w ith	 which
emotions	pass	from	one	person	to	another.	In	a	simple	experiment	t wo
volunteers	 filled	 out	 a	 checklist	 about	 their	 moods	 at	 the	 moment,
then	 simply	 sat	 facing	 each	 other	 quietly	 while	 wait ing	 for	 an
experimenter	to	return	to	the	room.	Two	minutes	later	 she	came	back
and	 asked	 them	 to	 fill	 out	 a	 mood	 checklist	 again.	 Th e	 pairs	 were
purposely	 composed	 of	 one	 partner	 who	 was	 highly	 exp ressive	 of
emotion	and	one	who	was	deadpan.	Invariably	the	mood	 of	the	one
who	 was	 more	 expressive	 of	 emotions	 had	 been	 transfer red	 to	 the
more	passive	partner. 4
How	does	this	magical	transmission	occur?	The	most	lik ely	answer
is	 that	 we	 unconsciously	 imitate	 the	 emotions	 we	 see	 displayed	 by
someone	 else,	 through	 an	 out-of-awareness	 motor	 mimicry 	 of	 their
facial	expression,	gestures,	tone	of	voice,	and	oth er	nonverbal	markers
of	emotion.	Through	this	imitation	people	re-create	i n	themselves	the
mood	 of	 the	 other	 person—a	 low-key	 version	 of	 the	 Sta nislavsky
method,	 in	 which	 actors	 recall	 gestures,	 movements,	 an d	 other
expressions	of	an	emotion	they	have	felt	strongly	in 	the	past	in	order
to	evoke	those	feelings	once	again.
The	 day-to-day	 imitation	 of	 feeling	 is	 ordinarily	 qu ite	 subtle.	 Ulf
======================================== [Página 139] ========================================

Dimberg,	 a	 Swedish	 researcher	 at	 the	 University	 of	 U ppsala,	 found
that	when	people	view	a	smiling	or	angry	face,	their 	own	faces	show
evidence	 of	 that	 same	 mood	 through	 slight	 changes	 in	 the	 facial
muscles.	The	changes	are	evident	through	electronic	 sensors	but	are
typically	not	visible	to	the	naked	eye.
When	 two	 people	 interact,	 the	 direction	 of	 mood	 tran sfer	 is	 from
the	one	who	is	more	forceful	in	expressing	feelings	 to	the	one	who	is
more	 passive.	 But	 some	 people	 are	 particularly	 suscep tible	 to
emotional	 contagion;	 their	 innate	 sensitivity	 makes	 t heir	 autonomic
nervous	system	(a	marker	of	emotional	activity)	more	ea sily	triggered.
This	 lability	 seems	 to	 make	 them	 more	 impressionable;	 se ntimental
commercials	 can	 move	 them	 to	 tears,	 while	 a	 quick	 chat	 with
someone	 who	 is	 feeling	 cheerful	 can	 buoy	 them	 (it	 als o	 may	 make
them	more	empathic,	since	they	are	more	readily	moved	by 	someone
else’s	feelings).
John	 Cacioppo,	 the	 social	 psychophysiologist	 at	 Ohi o	 State
University	who	has	studied	this	subtle	emotional	exc hange,	observes,
“Just	 seeing	 someone	 express	 an	 emotion	 can	 evoke	 tha t	 mood,
whether	 you	 realize	 you	 mimic	 the	 facial	 expression	 o r	 not.	 This
happens	 to	 us	 all	 the	 time—there’s	 a	 dance,	 a	 synchro ny,	 a
transmission	 of	 emotions.	 This	 mood	 synchrony	 determine s	 whether
you	feel	an	interaction	went	well	or	not.”
The	 degree	 of	 emotional	 rapport	 people	 feel	 in	 an	 en counter	 is
mirrored	by	how	tightly	orchestrated	their	physical	 movements	are	as
they	 talk—an	 index	 of	 closeness	 that	 is	 typically	 ou t	 of	 awareness.
One	person	nods	just	as	the	other	makes	a	point,	or	 both	shift	in	their
chairs	at	the	same	moment,	or	one	leans	forward	as	the 	other	moves
back.	 The	 orchestration	 can	 be	 as	 subtle	 as	 both	 pe ople	 rocking	 in
swivel	 chairs	 at	 the	 same	 rhythm.	 Just	 as	 Daniel	 Ster n	 found	 in
watching	 the	 synchrony	 between	 attuned	 mothers	 and	 t heir	 infants,
the	 same	 reciprocity	 links	 the	 movements	 of	 people	 who 	 feel
emotional	rapport.
This	 synchrony	 seems	 to	 facilitate	 the	 sending	 and	 r eceiving	 of
moods,	even	if	the	moods	are	negative.	For	example,	in 	one	study	of
physical	synchrony,	women	who	were	depressed	came	to	 a	laboratory
with	 their	 romantic	 partners,	 and	 discussed	 a	 proble m	 in	 their
relationship.	 The	 more	 synchrony	 between	 the	 partner s	 at	 the
nonverbal	level,	the	worse	the	depressed	women’s	par tners	felt	after
the	 discussion—they	 had	 caught	 their	 girlfriends’	 ba d	 moods. 5	 In
short,	 whether	 people	 feel	 upbeat	 or	 down,	 the	 more	 physically
======================================== [Página 140] ========================================

attuned	their	encounter,	the	more	similar	their	moods	will	beco me.
The	synchrony	between	teachers	and	students	indicat es	how	much
rapport	 they	 feel;	 studies	 in	 classrooms	 show	 that	 t he	 closer	 the
movement	coordination	between	teacher	and	student,	th e	more	they
felt	 friendly,	 happy,	 enthused,	 interested,	 and	 eas ygoing	 while
interacting.	 In	 general,	 a	 high	 level	 of	 synchrony	 in	 an	 interaction
means	the	people	involved	like	each	other.	Frank	Ber nieri,	the	Oregon
State	 University	 psychologist	 who	 did	 these	 studies ,	 told	 me,	 “How
awkward	 or	 comfortable	 you	 feel	 with	 someone	 is	 at	 so me	 level
physical.	 You	 need	 to	 have	 compatible	 timing,	 to	 coor dinate	 your
movements,	 to	 feel	 comfortable.	 Synchrony	 reflects	 the 	 depth	 of
engagement	 between	 the	 partners;	 if	 you’re	 highly	 en gaged,	 your
moods	begin	to	mesh,	whether	positive	or	negative.”
In	short,	coordination	of	moods	is	the	essence	of	ra pport,	the	adult
version	 of	 the	 attunement	 a	 mother	 has	 with	 her	 infan t.	 One
determinant	of	interpersonal	effectiveness,	Cacioppo 	proposes,	is	how
deftly	people	carry	out	this	emotional	synchrony.	If 	they	are	adept	at
attuning	to	people’s	moods,	or	can	easily	bring	othe rs	under	the	sway
of	 their	 own,	 then	 their	 interactions	 will	 go	 more	 s moothly	 at	 the
emotional	level.	The	mark	of	a	powerful	leader	or	per former	is	being
able	 to	 move	 an	 audience	 of	 thousands	 in	 this	 way.	 B y	 the	 same
token,	Cacioppo	points	out	that	people	who	are	poor 	at	receiving	and
sending	emotions	are	prone	to	problems	in	their	relat ionships,	since
people	 often	 feel	 uncomfortable	 with	 them,	 even	 if	 th ey	 can’t
articulate	just	why	this	is	so.
Setting	the	emotional	tone	of	an	interaction	is,	in	 a	sense,	a	sign	of
dominance	 at	 a	 deep	 and	 intimate	 level:	 it	 means	 drivi ng	 the
emotional	state	of	the	other	person.	This	power	to	d etermine	emotion
is	 akin	 to	 what	 is	 called	 in	 biology	 a	 Zeitgeber 	 (literally,	 “time-
grabber”),	 a	 process	 (such	 as	 the	 day-night	 cycle	 o r	 the	 monthly
phases	 of	 the	 moon)	 that	 entrains	 biological	 rhythms. 	 For	 a	 couple
dancing,	the	music	is	a	bodily	zeitgeber.	When	it	co mes	to	personal
encounters,	the	person	who	has	the	more	forceful	exp ressivity—or	the
most	power—is	typically	the	one	whose	emotions	entrain 	the	other.
Dominant	partners	talk	more,	while	the	subordinate	pa rtner	watches
the	other’s	face	more—a	setup	for	the	transmission	of	 affect.	By	the
same	 token,	 the	 forcefulness	 of	 a	 good	 speaker—a	 poli tician	 or	 an
evangelist,	say—works	to	entrain	the	emotions	of	the	 audience. 6	That
is	 what	 we	 mean	 by,	 “He	 had	 them	 in	 the	 palm	 of	 his	 han d.”
Emotional	entrainment	is	the	heart	of	influence.

THE	RUDIMENTS	OF	SOCIAL	INTELLIGENCE
It’s	 recess	 at	 a	 preschool,	 and	 a	 band	 of	 boys	 is	 r unning	 across	 the
grass.	 Reggie	 trips,	 hurts	 his	 knee,	 and	 starts	 cry ing,	 but	 the	 other
boys	keep	right	on	running—save	for	Roger,	who	stops .	As	Reggie’s
sobs	subside	Roger	reaches	down	and	rubs	his	own	kn ee,	calling	out,
“I	hurt	my	knee,	too!”
Roger	 is	 cited	 as	 having	 exemplary	 interpersonal	 int elligence	 by
Thomas	 Hatch,	 a	 colleague	 of	 Howard	 Gardner	 at	 Spectru m,	 the
school	 based	 on	 the	 concept	 of	 multiple	 intelligence s.7	 Roger,	 it
seems,	is	unusually	adept	at	recognizing	the	feeling s	of	his	playmates
and	making	rapid,	smooth	connections	with	them.	It	was 	only	Roger
who	 noticed	 Reggie’s	 plight	 and	 pain,	 and	 only	 Roge r	 who	 tried	 to
provide	some	solace,	even	if	all	he	could	offer	was	 rubbing	his	own
knee.	This	small	gesture	bespeaks	a	talent	for	rappo rt,	an	emotional
skill	essential	for	the	preservation	of	close	relat ionships,	whether	in	a
marriage,	 a	 friendship,	 or	 a	 business	 partnership.	 S uch	 skills	 in
preschoolers	are	the	buds	of	talents	that	ripen	through	life .
Roger’s	 talent	 represents	 one	 of	 four	 separate	 abil ities	 that	 Hatch
and	Gardner	identify	as	components	of	interpersonal	intelli gence:
•	Organizing	groups —the	 essential	 skill	 of	 the	 leader,	 this	 involves
initiating	and	coordinating	the	efforts	of	a	networ k	of	people.	This	is
the	talent	seen	in	theater	directors	or	producers,	 in	military	officers,
and	in	effective	heads	of	organizations	and	units	o f	all	kinds.	On	the
playground,	 this	 is	 the	 child	 who	 takes	 the	 lead	 in 	 deciding	 what
everyone	will	play,	or	becomes	team	captain.
•	Negotiating	solutions —the	 talent	 of	 the	 mediator,	 preventing
conflicts	or	resolving	those	that	flare	up.	People	 who	have	this	ability
excel	in	deal-making,	in	arbitrating	or	mediating	dis putes;	they	might
have	a	career	in	diplomacy,	in	arbitration	or	law,	o r	as	middlemen	or
managers	 of	 takeovers.	 These	 are	 the	 kids	 who	 settle 	 arguments	 on
the	playing	field.
•	Personal	 connection —Roger’s	 talent,	 that	 of	 empathy	 and
connecting.	 This	 makes	 it	 easy	 to	 enter	 into	 an	 enco unter	 or	 to
recognize	and	respond	fittingly	to	people’s	feeling s	and	concerns—the
art	 of	 relationship.	 Such	 people	 make	 good	 “team	 play ers,”
dependable	spouses,	good	friends	or	business	partne rs;	in	the	business
world	 they	 do	 well	 as	 salespeople	 or	 managers,	 or	 ca n	 be	 excellent

else,	 easily	 enter	 into	 playing	 with	 them,	 and	 are	 h appy	 doing	 so.
These	 children	 tend	 to	 be	 best	 at	 reading	 emotions	 f rom	 facial
expressions	and	are	most	liked	by	their	classmates.
•	Social	analysis —being	 able	 to	 detect	 and	 have	 insights	 about
people’s	 feelings,	 motives,	 and	 concerns.	 This	 knowl edge	 of	 how
others	 feel	 can	 lead	 to	 an	 easy	 intimacy	 or	 sense	 of 	 rapport.	 At	 its
best,	this	ability	makes	one	a	competent	therapist	or 	counselor—or,	if
combined	with	some	literary	talent,	a	gifted	novelist	or	dramat ist.
Taken	together,	these	skills	are	the	stuff	of	inter personal	polish,	the
necessary	ingredients	for	charm,	social	success,	eve n	charisma.	Those
who	 are	 adept	 in	 social	 intelligence	 can	 connect	 wi th	 people	 quite
smoothly,	be	astute	in	reading	their	reactions	and	f eelings,	lead	and
organize,	and	handle	the	disputes	that	are	bound	to 	flare	up	in	any
human	 activity.	 They	 are	 the	 natural	 leaders,	 the	 pe ople	 who	 can
express	 the	 unspoken	 collective	 sentiment	 and	 articu late	 it	 so	 as	 to
guide	a	group	toward	its	goals.	They	are	the	kind	o f	people	others	like
to	be	with	because	they	are	emotionally	nourishing—th ey	leave	other
people	in	a	good	mood,	and	evoke	the	comment,	“What	a	 pleasure	to
be	around	someone	like	that.”
These	interpersonal	abilities	build	on	other	emotion al	intelligences.
People	 who	 make	 an	 excellent	 social	 impression,	 for	 e xample,	 are
adept	 at	 monitoring	 their	 own	 expression	 of	 emotion,	 are	 keenly
attuned	to	the	ways	others	are	reacting,	and	so	are 	able	to	continually
fine-tune	their	social	performance,	adjusting	it	to	 make	sure	they	are
having	the	desired	effect.	In	that	sense,	they	are	like	skill ed	actors.
However,	 if	 these	 interpersonal	 abilities	 are	 not	 b alanced	 by	 an
astute	sense	of	one’s	own	needs	and	feelings	and	ho w	to	fulfill	them,
they	can	lead	to	a	hollow	social	success—a	popularit y	won	at	the	cost
of	 one’s	 true	 satisfaction.	 Such	 is	 the	 argument	 of	 Mark	 Snyder,	 a
University	 of	 Minnesota	 psychologist	 who	 has	 studie d	 people	 whose
social	 skills	 make	 them	 first-rate	 social	 chameleons,	 champions	 at
making	a	good	impression. 8	Their	psychological	credo	might	well	be	a
remark	by	W.	H.	Auden,	who	said	that	his	private	imag e	of	himself	“is
very	 different	 from	 the	 image	 which	 I	 try	 to	 create	 i n	 the	 minds	 of
others	in	order	that	they	may	love	me.”	That	trade-of f	can	be	made	if
social	skills	outstrip	the	ability	to	know	and	hono r	one’s	own	feelings:
in	 order	 to	 be	 loved—or	 at	 least	 liked—the	 social	 cha meleon	 will
seem	 to	 be	 whatever	 those	 he	 is	 with	 seem	 to	 want.	 Th e	 sign	 that
someone	 falls	 into	 this	 pattern,	 Snyder	 finds,	 is	 th at	 they	 make	 an
======================================== [Página 143] ========================================

excellent	 impression,	 yet	 have	 few	 stable	 or	 satisfy ing	 intimate
relationships.	A	more	healthy	pattern,	of	course,	is 	to	balance	being
true	to	oneself	with	social	skills,	using	them	with	integrity .
Social	chameleons,	though,	don’t	mind	in	the	least	sa ying	one	thing
and	doing	another,	if	that	will	win	them	social	appr oval.	They	simply
live	with	the	discrepancy	between	their	public	face 	and	their	private
reality.	Helena	Deutsch,	a	psychoanalyst,	called	suc h	people	the	“as-if
personality,”	shifting	personas	with	remarkable	plas ticity	as	they	pick
up	 signals	 from	 those	 around	 them.	 “For	 some	 people,”	 Snyder	 told
me,	“the	public	and	private	person	meshes	well,	while 	for	others	there
seems	 to	 be	 only	 a	 kaleidoscope	 of	 changing	 appearan ces.	 They	 are
like	 Woody	 Allen’s	 character	 Zelig,	 madly	 trying	 to	 f it	 in	 with
whomever	they	are	with.”
Such	 people	 try	 to	 scan	 someone	 for	 a	 hint	 as	 to	 wha t	 is	 wanted
from	 them	 before	 they	 make	 a	 response,	 rather	 than	 simp ly	 saying
what	 they	 truly	 feel.	 To	 get	 along	 and	 be	 liked,	 th ey	 are	 willing	 to
make	people	they	dislike	think	they	are	friendly	wit h	them.	And	they
use	 their	 social	 abilities	 to	 mold	 their	 actions	 as	 disparate	 social
situations	 demand,	 so	 that	 they	 may	 act	 like	 very	 dif ferent	 people
depending	on	whom	they	are	with,	swinging	from	bubbly 	sociability,
say,	to	reserved	withdrawal.	To	be	sure,	to	the	ext ent	that	these	traits
lead	 to	 effective	 impression	 management,	 they	 are	 high ly	 prized	 in
certain	 professions,	 notably	 acting,	 trial	 law,	 sal es,	 diplomacy,	 and
politics.
Another,	 perhaps	 more	 crucial	 kind	 of	 self-monitoring 	 seems	 to
make	 the	 difference	 between	 those	 who	 end	 up	 as	 anch orless	 social
chameleons,	trying	to	impress	everyone,	and	those	who 	can	use	their
social	 polish	 more	 in	 keeping	 with	 their	 true	 feelin gs.	 That	 is	 the
capacity	 to	 be	 true,	 as	 the	 saying	 has	 it,	 “to	 thin e	 own	 self,”	 which
allows	 acting	 in	 accord	 with	 one’s	 deepest	 feelings 	 and	 values	 no
matter	what	the	social	consequences.	Such	emotional	i ntegrity	could
well	lead	to,	say,	deliberately	provoking	a	confron tation	in	order	to
cut	 through	 duplicity	 or	 denial—a	 clearing	 of	 the	 ai r	 that	 a	 social
chameleon	would	never	attempt.
THE	MAKING	OF	A	SOCIAL	INCOMPETENT
There	was	no	doubt	Cecil	was	bright;	he	was	a	colle ge-trained	expert
in	 foreign	 languages,	 superb	 at	 translating.	 But	 th ere	 were	 crucial
======================================== [Página 144] ========================================

ways	 in	 which	 he	 was	 completely	 inept.	 Cecil	 seemed	 t o	 lack	 the
simplest	 social	 skills.	 He	 would	 muff	 a	 casual	 convers ation	 over
coffee,	and	fumble	when	having	to	pass	the	time	of	da y;	in	short,	he
seemed	 incapable	 of	 the	 most	 routine	 social	 exchange. 	 Because	 his
lack	of	social	grace	was	most	profound	when	he	was	a round	women,
Cecil	 came	 to	 therapy	 wondering	 if	 perhaps	 he	 had	 “h omosexual
tendencies	of	an	underlying	nature,”	as	he	put	it,	 though	he	had	no
such	fantasies.
The	real	problem,	Cecil	confided	to	his	therapist,	w as	that	he	feared
that	nothing	he	could	say	would	be	of	any	interest	 to	anybody.	This
underlying	fear	only	compounded	a	profound	paucity	o f	social	graces.
His	nervousness	during	encounters	led	him	to	snicker	 and	laugh	at	the
most	 awkward	 moments,	 even	 though	 he	 failed	 to	 laugh	 w hen
someone	 said	 something	 genuinely	 funny.	 Cecil’s	 awkwa rdness,	 he
confided	to	his	therapist,	went	back	to	childhood;	 all	his	life	he	had
felt	 socially	 at	 ease	 only	 when	 he	 was	 with	 his	 old er	 brother,	 who
somehow	 helped	 ease	 things	 for	 him.	 But	 once	 he	 left	 home,	 his
ineptitude	was	overwhelming;	he	was	socially	paralyzed.
The	 tale	 is	 told	 by	 Lakin	 Phillips,	 a	 psychologist	 at	 George
Washington	University,	who	proposes	that	Cecil’s	pl ight	stems	from	a
failure	 to	 learn	 in	 childhood	 the	 most	 elementary	 les sons	 of	 social
interaction:
What	could	Cecil	have	been	taught	earlier?	To	speak	dir ectly	to	others	when	spoken	to;
to	initiate	social	contact,	not	always	wait	for	other s;	to	carry	on	a	conversation,	not
simply	fall	back	on	yes	or	no	or	other	one-word	replie s;	to	express	gratitude	toward
others,	to	let	another	person	walk	before	one	in	passi ng	through	a	door;	to	wait	until
one	is	served	something	…	to	thank	others,	to	say	“pleas e,”	to	share,	and	all	the	other
elementary	interactions	we	begin	to	teach	children	from	 age	2	onward.9
Whether	Cecil’s	deficiency	was	due	to	another’s	fai lure	to	teach	him
such	 rudiments	 of	 social	 civility	 or	 to	 his	 own	 inab ility	 to	 learn	 is
unclear.	But	whatever	its	roots,	Cecil’s	story	is	i nstructive	because	it
points	 up	 the	 crucial	 nature	 of	 the	 countless	 lesso ns	 children	 get	 in
interaction	synchrony	and	the	unspoken	rules	of	soc ial	harmony.	The
net	effect	of	failing	to	follow	these	rules	is	to	c reate	waves,	to	make
those	around	us	uncomfortable.	The	function	of	these 	rules,	of	course,
is	 to	 keep	 everyone	 involved	 in	 a	 social	 exchange	 a t	 ease;
awkwardness	spawns	anxiety.	People	who	lack	these	s kills	are	inept
not	just	at	social	niceties,	but	at	handling	the	emo tions	of	those	they
======================================== [Página 145] ========================================

encounter;	they	inevitably	leave	disturbance	in	their	wake .
We	all	have	known	Cecils,	people	with	an	annoying	l ack	of	social
graces—people	who	don’t	seem	to	know	when	to	end	a	co nversation
or	phone	call	and	who	keep	on	talking,	oblivious	to 	all	cues	and	hints
to	say	good-bye;	people	whose	conversation	centers	 on	themselves	all
the	 time,	 without	 the	 least	 interest	 in	 anyone	 else, 	 and	 who	 ignore
tentative	attempts	to	refocus	on	another	topic;	peop le	who	intrude	or
ask	“nosy”	questions.	These	derailments	of	a	smooth	s ocial	trajectory
all	bespeak	a	deficit	in	the	rudimentary	building	blocks	of	in teraction.
Psychologists	 have	 coined	 the	 term	 dyssemia 	 (from	 the	 Greek	 dys-
for	“difficulty”	and	 semes 	for	“signal”)	for	what	amounts	to	a	learning
disability	 in	 the	 realm	 of	 nonverbal	 messages;	 about	 one	 in	 ten
children	has	one	or	more	problems	in	this	realm. 10	The	problem	can
be	in	a	poor	sense	of	personal	space,	so	that	a	chi ld	stands	too	close
while	talking	or	spreads	their	belongings	into	othe r	people’s	territory;
in	 interpreting	 or	 using	 body	 language	 poorly;	 in	 mi sinterpreting	 or
misusing	facial	expressions	by,	say,	failing	to	make	 eye	contact;	or	in
a	poor	sense	of	prosody,	the	emotional	quality	of	sp eech,	so	that	they
talk	too	shrilly	or	flatly.
Much	research	has	focused	on	spotting	children	who	 show	signs	of
social	deficiency,	children	whose	awkwardness	makes	 them	neglected
or	rejected	by	their	playmates.	Apart	from	children	w ho	are	spurned
because	 they	 are	 bullies,	 those	 whom	 other	 children	 avoid	 are
invariably	 deficient	 in	 the	 rudiments	 of	 face-to-fac e	 interaction,
particularly	the	unspoken	rules	that	govern	encount ers.	If	children	do
poorly	in	language,	people	assume	they	are	not	very	 bright	or	poorly
educated;	 but	 when	 they	 do	 poorly	 in	 the	 nonverbal	 rules	 of
interaction,	people—especially	playmates—see	them	as	“s trange,”	and
avoid	 them.	 These	 are	 the	 children	 who	 don’t	 know	 ho w	 to	 join	 a
game	gracefully,	who	touch	others	in	ways	that	make	f or	discomfort
rather	than	camaraderie—in	short,	who	are	“off.”	They 	are	children
who	 have	 failed	 to	 master	 the	 silent	 language	 of	 emot ion,	 and	 who
unwittingly	send	messages	that	create	uneasiness.
As	Stephen	Nowicki,	an	Emory	University	psychologist 	who	studies
children’s	 nonverbal	 abilities,	 put	 it,	 “Children	 w ho	 can’t	 read	 or
express	emotions	well	constantly	feel	frustrated.	In 	essence,	they	don’t
understand	what’s	going	on.	This	kind	of	communicatio n	is	a	constant
subtext	 of	 everything	 you	 do;	 you	 can’t	 stop	 showin g	 your	 facial
expression	 or	 posture,	 or	 hide	 your	 tone	 of	 voice.	 If	 you	 make
mistakes	 in	 what	 emotional	 messages	 you	 send,	 you	 cons tantly
======================================== [Página 146] ========================================

experience	that	people	react	to	you	in	funny	ways—yo u	get	rebuffed
and	 don’t	 know	 why.	 If	 you’re	 thinking	 you’re	 actin g	 happy	 but
actually	seem	too	hyper	or	angry,	you	find	other	kid s	getting	angry	at
you	in	turn,	and	you	don’t	realize	why.	Such	kids	e nd	up	feeling	no
sense	of	control	over	how	other	people	treat	them,	t hat	their	actions
have	 no	 impact	 on	 what	 happens	 to	 them.	 It	 leaves	 the m	 feeling
powerless,	depressed,	and	apathetic.”
Apart	 from	 becoming	 social	 isolates,	 such	 children	 al so	 suffer
academically.	The	classroom,	of	course,	is	as	much	a	s ocial	situation
as	an	academic	one;	the	socially	awkward	child	is	as 	likely	to	misread
and	misrespond	to	a	teacher	as	to	another	child.	The 	resulting	anxiety
and	bewilderment	can	themselves	interfere	with	their	 ability	to	learn
effectively.	 Indeed,	 as	 tests	 of	 children’s	 nonverb al	 sensitivity	 have
shown,	those	who	misread	emotional	cues	tend	to	do	po orly	in	school
compared	to	their	academic	potential	as	reflected	in	IQ	tests. 11
“WE	HATE	YOU”:	AT	THE	THRESHOLD
Social	ineptitude	is	perhaps	most	painful	and	explic it	when	it	comes
to	 one	 of	 the	 more	 perilous	 moments	 in	 the	 life	 of	 a	 y oung	 child:
being	on	the	edge	of	a	group	at	play	you	want	to	jo in.	It	is	a	moment
of	peril,	one	when	being	liked	or	hated,	belonging	 or	not,	is	made	all
too	public.	For	that	reason	that	crucial	moment	has	b een	the	subject
of	intense	scrutiny	by	students	of	child	development ,	revealing	a	stark
contrast	in	approach	strategies	used	by	popular	chi ldren	and	by	social
outcasts.	 The	 findings	 highlight	 just	 how	 crucial	 i t	 is	 for	 social
competence	 to	 notice,	 interpret,	 and	 respond	 to	 emoti onal	 and
interpersonal	 cues.	 While	 it	 is	 poignant	 to	 see	 a	 c hild	 hover	 on	 the
edge	 of	 others	 at	 play,	 wanting	 to	 join	 in	 but	 bein g	 left	 out,	 it	 is	 a
universal	predicament.	Even	the	most	popular	children 	are	sometimes
rejected—a	study	of	second	and	third	graders	found	t hat	26	percent	of
the	time	the	most	well	liked	children	were	rebuffed	when	they	tr ied	to
enter	a	group	already	at	play.
Young	children	are	brutally	candid	about	the	emotion al	judgment
implicit	in	such	rejections.	Witness	the	following	d ialogue	from	four-
year-olds	 in	 a	 preschool. 12	 Linda	 wants	 to	 join	 Barbara,	 Nancy,	 and
Bill,	 who	 are	 playing	 with	 toy	 animals	 and	 building	 blocks.	 She
watches	 for	 a	 minute,	 then	 makes	 her	 approach,	 sittin g	 next	 to
Barbara	 and	 starting	 to	 play	 with	 the	 animals.	 Barba ra	 turns	 to	 her
======================================== [Página 147] ========================================

and	says,	“You	can’t	play!”
“Yes,	I	can,”	Linda	counters.	“I	can	have	some	animals,	too.”
“No,	you	can’t,”	Barbara	says	bluntly.	“We	don’t	like	you	tod ay.”
When	 Bill	 protests	 on	 Linda’s	 behalf,	 Nancy	 joins	 t he	 attack:	 “We
hate	her	today.”
Because	of	the	danger	of	being	told,	either	explici tly	or	implicitly,
“We	 hate	 you,”	 all	 children	 are	 understandably	 caut ious	 on	 the
threshold	of	approaching	a	group.	That	anxiety,	of	 course,	is	probably
not	 much	 different	 from	 that	 felt	 by	 a	 grown-up	 at	 a	 cocktail	 party
with	 strangers	 who	 hangs	 back	 from	 a	 happily	 chattin g	 group	 who
seem	to	be	intimate	friends.	Because	this	moment	at	the 	threshold	of	a
group	is	so	momentous	for	a	child,	it	is	also,	as	one 	researcher	put	it,
“highly	 diagnostic	 …	 quickly	 revealing	 differences	 i n	 social
skillfulness.” 13
Typically,	 newcomers	 simply	 watch	 for	 a	 time,	 then	 joi n	 in	 very
tentatively	at	first,	being	more	assertive	only	in	v ery	cautious	steps.
What	matters	most	for	whether	a	child	is	accepted	or	 not	is	how	well
he	or	she	is	able	to	enter	into	the	group’s	frame	of 	reference,	sensing
what	kind	of	play	is	in	flow,	what	out	of	place.
The	two	cardinal	sins	that	almost	always	lead	to	rej ection	are	trying
to	take	the	lead	too	soon	and	being	out	of	synch	wi th	the	frame	of
reference.	But	this	is	exactly	what	unpopular	child ren	tend	to	do:	they
push	their	way	into	a	group,	trying	to	change	the	s ubject	too	abruptly
or	too	soon,	or	offering	their	own	opinions,	or	simply	disagre eing	with
the	 others	 right	 away—all	 apparent	 attempts	 to	 draw	 a ttention	 to
themselves.	 Paradoxically,	 this	 results	 in	 their	 bei ng	 ignored	 or
rejected.	By	contrast,	popular	children	spend	time	observin g	the	group
to	 understand	 what’s	 going	 on	 before	 entering	 in,	 a nd	 then	 do
something	that	shows	they	accept	it;	they	wait	to	ha ve	their	status	in
the	 group	 confirmed	 before	 taking	 initiative	 in	 sugg esting	 what	 the
group	should	do.
Let’s	 return	 to	 Roger,	 the	 four-year-old	 whom	 Thomas	 Hatch
spotted	exhibiting	a	high	level	of	interpersonal	in telligence. 14	Roger’s
tactic	for	entering	a	group	was	first	to	observe,	t hen	to	imitate	what
another	child	was	doing,	and	finally	to	talk	to	the 	child	and	fully	join
the	 activity—a	 winning	 strategy.	 Roger’s	 skill	 was	 s hown,	 for
instance,	 when	 he	 and	 Warren	 were	 playing	 at	 puttin g	 “bombs”
(actually	pebbles)	in	their	socks.	Warren	asks	Roge r	if	he	wants	to	be
in	a	helicopter	or	an	airplane.	Roger	asks,	before	 committing	himself,
“Are	you	in	a	helicopter?”
======================================== [Página 148] ========================================

This	 seemingly	 innocuous	 moment	 reveals	 sensitivity	 to 	 others’
concerns,	 and	 the	 ability	 to	 act	 on	 that	 knowledge	 in	 a	 way	 that
maintains	the	connection.	Hatch	comments	about	Roger,	“ He	‘checks
in’	with	his	playmate	so	that	they	and	their	play	re main	connected.	I
have	 watched	 many	 other	 children	 who	 simply	 get	 in	 th eir	 own
helicopters	 or	 planes	 and,	 literally	 and	 figurative ly,	 fly	 away	 from
each	other.”
EMOTIONAL	BRILLIANCE:	A	CASE	REPORT
If	the	test	of	social	skill	is	the	ability	to	calm	d istressing	emotions	in
others,	 then	 handling	 someone	 at	 the	 peak	 of	 rage	 is 	 perhaps	 the
ultimate	measure	of	mastery.	The	data	on	self-regulati on	of	anger	and
emotional	 contagion	 suggest	 that	 one	 effective	 strat egy	 might	 be	 to
distract	the	angry	person,	empathize	with	his	feelin gs	and	perspective,
and	 then	 draw	 him	 into	 an	 alternative	 focus,	 one	 tha t	 attunes	 him
with	a	more	positive	range	of	feeling—a	kind	of	emotional	judo.
Such	refined	skill	in	the	fine	art	of	emotional	infl uence	is	perhaps
best	 exemplified	 by	 a	 story	 told	 by	 an	 old	 friend,	 t he	 late	 Terry
Dobson,	 who	 in	 the	 1950s	 was	 one	 of	 the	 first	 Americ ans	 ever	 to
study	 the	 martial	 art	 aikido	 in	 Japan.	 One	 afternoon 	 he	 was	 riding
home	 on	 a	 suburban	 Tokyo	 train	 when	 a	 huge,	 bellicos e,	 and	 very
drunk	 and	 begrimed	 laborer	 got	 on.	 The	 man,	 staggerin g,	 began
terrorizing	 the	 passengers:	 screaming	 curses,	 he	 too k	 a	 swing	 at	 a
woman	holding	a	baby,	sending	her	sprawling	in	the	laps	of	an	el derly
couple,	who	then	jumped	up	and	joined	a	stampede	to	t he	other	end
of	 the	 car.	 The	 drunk,	 taking	 a	 few	 other	 swings	 (a nd,	 in	 his	 rage,
missing),	grabbed	the	metal	pole	in	the	middle	of	the	 car	with	a	roar
and	tried	to	tear	it	out	of	its	socket.
At	that	point	Terry,	who	was	in	peak	physical	condi tion	from	daily
eight-hour	 aikido	 workouts,	 felt	 called	 upon	 to	 int ervene,	 lest
someone	get	seriously	hurt.	But	he	recalled	the	word s	of	his	teacher:
“Aikido	is	the	art	of	reconciliation.	Whoever	has	t he	mind	to	fight	has
broken	 his	 connection	 with	 the	 universe.	 If	 you	 try 	 to	 dominate
people	you	are	already	defeated.	We	study	how	to	resolve	conf lict,	not
how	to	start	it.”
Indeed,	Terry	had	agreed	upon	beginning	lessons	wit h	his	teacher
never	to	pick	a	fight,	and	to	use	his	martial-arts	s kills	only	in	defense.
Now,	at	last,	he	saw	his	chance	to	test	his	aikido	 abilities	in	real	life,
======================================== [Página 149] ========================================

in	 what	 was	 clearly	 a	 legitimate	 opportunity.	 So,	 as 	 all	 the	 other
passengers	sat	frozen	in	their	seats,	Terry	stood	u p,	slowly	and	with
deliberation.
Seeing	him,	the	drunk	roared,	“Aha!	A	foreigner!	You 	need	a	lesson
in	Japanese	manners!”	and	began	gathering	himself	to	take	on	Te rry.
But	 just	 as	 the	 drunk	 was	 on	 the	 verge	 of	 making	 his 	 move,
someone	gave	an	earsplitting,	oddly	joyous	shout:	“Hey!”
The	shout	had	the	cheery	tone	of	someone	who	has	sud denly	come
upon	a	fond	friend.	The	drunk,	surprised,	spun	arou nd	to	see	a	tiny
Japanese	 man,	 probably	 in	 his	 seventies,	 sitting	 the re	 in	 a	 kimono.
The	 old	 man	 beamed	 with	 delight	 at	 the	 drunk,	 and	 bec koned	 him
over	with	a	light	wave	of	his	hand	and	a	lilting	“C’mere.”
The	 drunk	 strode	 over	 with	 a	 belligerent,	 “Why	 the	 hell	 should	 I
talk	 to	 you?”	 Meanwhile,	 Terry	 was	 ready	 to	 fell	 th e	 drunk	 in	 a
moment	if	he	made	the	least	violent	move.
“What’cha	been	drinking?”	the	old	man	asked,	his	eye s	beaming	at
the	drunken	laborer.
“I	 been	 drinking	 sake,	 and	 it’s	 none	 of	 your	 busine ss,”	 the	 drunk
bellowed.
“Oh,	that’s	wonderful,	absolutely	wonderful,”	the	o ld	man	replied
in	a	warm	tone.	“You	see,	I	love	sake,	too.	Every	ni ght,	me	and	my
wife	(she’s	seventy-six,	you	know),	we	warm	up	a	lit tle	bottle	of	sake
and	 take	 it	 out	 into	 the	 garden,	 and	 we	 sit	 on	 an	 o ld	 wooden
bench	…”	He	continued	on	about	the	persimmon	tree	in	hi s	backyard,
the	fortunes	of	his	garden,	enjoying	sake	in	the	evening.
The	drunk’s	face	began	to	soften	as	he	listened	to	 the	old	man;	his
fists	 unclenched.	 “Yeah	 …	 I	 love	 persimmons,	 too	 …,”	 he 	 said,	 his
voice	trailing	off.
“Yes,”	the	old	man	replied	in	a	sprightly	voice,	“an d	I’m	sure	you
have	a	wonderful	wife.”
“No,”	said	the	laborer.	“My	wife	died.…”	Sobbing,	he 	launched	into
a	sad	tale	of	losing	his	wife,	his	home,	his	job,	of 	being	ashamed	of
himself.
Just	then	the	train	came	to	Terry’s	stop,	and	as	he	 was	getting	off
he	turned	to	hear	the	old	man	invite	the	drunk	to	jo in	him	and	tell
him	all	about	it,	and	to	see	the	drunk	sprawl	along	 the	seat,	his	head
in	the	old	man’s	lap.
That	is	emotional	brilliance.

Intimate	Enemies
To	 love	 and	 to	 work,	 Sigmund	 Freud	 once	 remarked	 to	 h is	 disciple
Erik	Erikson,	are	the	twin	capacities	that	mark	full 	maturity.	If	that	is
the	case,	then	maturity	may	be	an	endangered	way	stat ion	in	life—
and	 current	 trends	 in	 marriage	 and	 divorce	 make	 emotio nal
intelligence	more	crucial	than	ever.
Consider	 divorce	 rates.	 The	 rate	 per	year 	 of	 divorces	 has	 more	 or
less	leveled	off.	But	there	is	another	way	of	calcu lating	divorce	rates,
one	 that	 suggests	 a	 perilous	 climb:	 looking	 at	 the	 o dds	 that	 a	 given
newly	 married	 couple	 will	 have	 their	 marriage	 eventually 	 end	 in
divorce.	 Although	 the	 overall	 rate	 of	 divorce	 has	 s topped	 climbing,
the	risk	of	divorce	has	been	shifting	to	newlyweds.
The	shift	gets	clearer	in	comparing	divorce	rates	fo r	couples	wed	in
a	given	year.	For	American	marriages	that	began	in	18 90,	about	10
percent	ended	in	divorce.	For	those	wed	in	1920,	th e	rate	was	about
18	 percent;	 for	 couples	 married	 in	 1950,	 30	 percent. 	 Couples	 that
were	 newly	 wed	 in	 1970	 had	 a	 fifty-fifty	 chance	 of	 splitting	 up	 or
staying	 together.	 And	 for	 married	 couples	 starting	 o ut	 in	 1990,	 the
likelihood	that	the	marriage	would	end	in	divorce	wa s	projected	to	be
close	to	a	staggering	67	percent! 1	If	the	estimate	holds,	just	three	in
ten	of	recent	 newlyweds	can	count	 on	staying	married 	 to	their	 new
partner.
It	 can	 be	 argued	 that	 much	 of	 this	 rise	 is	 due	 not	 s o	 much	 to	 a
decline	 in	 emotional	 intelligence	 as	 to	 the	 steady	 e rosion	 of	 social
pressures—the	 stigma	 surrounding	 divorce,	 or	 the	 econ omic
dependence	 of	 wives	 on	 their	 husbands—that	 used	 to	 k eep	 couples
together	in	even	the	most	miserable	of	matches.	But	if 	social	pressures
are	 no	 longer	 the	 glue	 that	 holds	 a	 marriage	 togethe r,	 then	 the
emotional	 forces	 between	 wife	 and	 husband	 are	 that	 mu ch	 more
crucial	if	their	union	is	to	survive.
These	ties	between	husband	and	wife—and	the	emotional 	fault	lines
that	can	break	them	apart—have	been	assayed	in	recent 	years	with	a
precision	 never	 seen	 before.	 Perhaps	 the	 biggest	 br eakthrough	 in
======================================== [Página 152] ========================================

understanding	 what	 holds	 a	 marriage	 together	 or	 tear s	 it	 apart	 has
come	from	the	use	of	sophisticated	physiological	measu res	that	allow
the	 moment-to-moment	 tracking	 of	 the	 emotional	 nuances	 o f	 a
couple’s	 encounter.	 Scientists	 are	 now	 able	 to	 dete ct	 a	 husband’s
otherwise	 invisible	 adrenaline	 surges	 and	 jumps	 in	 b lood	 pressure,
and	to	observe	fleeting	but	telling	microemotions	as	 they	flit	across	a
wife’s	 face.	 These	 physiological	 measures	 reveal	 a	 h idden	 biological
subtext	to	a	couple’s	difficulties,	a	critical	leve l	of	emotional	reality
that	 is	 typically	 imperceptible	 to	 or	 disregarded	 by 	 the	 couple
themselves.	These	measures	lay	bare	the	emotional	forc es	that	hold	a
relationship	together	or	destroy	it.	The	fault	line s	have	their	earliest
beginnings	 in	 the	 differences	 between	 the	 emotional	 worlds	 of	 girls
and	boys.
HIS	MARRIAGE	AND	HERS:	CHILDHOOD	ROOTS
As	 I	 was	 entering	 a	 restaurant	 on	 a	 recent	 evening, 	 a	 young	 man
stalked	 out	 the	 door,	 his	 face	 set	 in	 an	 expression 	 both	 stony	 and
sullen.	 Close	 on	 his	 heels	 a	 young	 woman	 came	 running ,	 her	 fists
desperately	 pummeling	 his	 back	 while	 she	 yelled,	 “God damn	 you!
Come	back	here	and	be	nice	to	me!”	That	poignant,	impo ssibly	self-
contradictory	plea	aimed	at	a	retreating	back	epitomi zes	the	pattern
most	commonly	seen	in	couples	whose	relationship	is	di stressed:	She
seeks	to	engage,	he	withdraws.	Marital	therapists	have	long 	noted	that
by	the	time	a	couple	finds	their	way	to	the	therapy	 office	they	are	in
this	 pattern	 of	 engage-withdraw,	 with	 his	 complaint	 about	 her
“unreasonable”	 demands	 and	 outbursts,	 and	 her	 lamenti ng	 his
indifference	to	what	she	is	saying.
This	marital	endgame	reflects	the	fact	that	there	are ,	in	effect,	two
emotional	 realities	 in	 a	 couple,	 his	 and	 hers.	 The	 r oots	 of	 these
emotional	differences,	while	they	may	be	partly	biological,	a lso	can	be
traced	back	to	childhood,	and	to	the	separate	emotio nal	worlds	boys
and	girls	inhabit	while	growing	up.	There	is	a	vast 	amount	of	research
on	 these	 separate	 worlds,	 their	 barriers	 reinforced 	 not	 just	 by	 the
different	games	boys	and	girls	prefer,	but	by	young	 children’s	fear	of
being	 teased	 for	 having	 a	 “girlfriend”	 or	 “boyfrien d.”2	 One	 study	 of
children’s	friendships	found	that	three-year-olds	s ay	about	half	their
friends	are	of	the	opposite	sex;	for	five-year-olds 	it’s	about	20	percent,
and	by	age	seven	almost	no	boys	or	girls	say	they	have	a	best	frie nd	of
======================================== [Página 153] ========================================

the	opposite	sex. 3	These	separate	social	universes	intersect	little	u ntil
teenagers	start	dating.
Meanwhile,	 boys	 and	 girls	 are	 taught	 very	 different 	 lessons	 about
handling	 emotions.	 Parents,	 in	 general,	 discuss	 emoti ons—with	 the
exception	of	anger—more	with	their	daughters	than	the ir	sons. 4	Girls
are	exposed	to	more	information	about	emotions	than	ar e	boys:	when
parents	make	up	stories	to	tell	their	preschool	chil dren,	they	use	more
emotion	words	when	talking	to	daughters	than	to	sons ;	when	mothers
play	 with	 their	 infants,	 they	 display	 a	 wider	 range 	 of	 emotions	 to
daughters	 than	 to	 sons;	 when	 mothers	 talk	 to	 daughte rs	 about
feelings,	 they	 discuss	 in	 more	 detail	 the	 emotional	 s tate	 itself	 than
they	 do	 with	 their	 sons—though	 with	 the	 sons	 they	 go 	 into	 more
detail	 about	 the	 causes	 and	 consequences	 of	 emotions 	 like	 anger
(probably	as	a	cautionary	tale).
Leslie	Brody	and	Judith	Hall,	who	have	summarized	the	 research	on
differences	in	emotions	between	the	sexes,	propose	t hat	because	girls
develop	facility	with	language	more	quickly	than	do	 boys,	this	leads
them	to	be	more	experienced	at	articulating	their	fee lings	and	more
skilled	 than	 boys	 at	 using	 words	 to	 explore	 and	 sub stitute	 for
emotional	 reactions	 such	 as	 physical	 fights;	 in	 cont rast,	 they	 note,
“boys,	 for	 whom	 the	 verbalization	 of	 affects	 is	 de-e mphasized,	 may
become	 largely	 unconscious	 of	 their	 emotional	 states, 	 both	 in
themselves	and	in	others.” 5
At	 age	 ten,	 roughly	 the	 same	 percent	 of	 girls	 as	 boy s	 are	 overtly
aggressive,	 given	 to	 open	 confrontation	 when	 angere d.	 But	 by	 age
thirteen,	a	telling	difference	between	the	sexes	eme rges:	Girls	become
more	 adept	 than	 boys	 at	 artful	 aggressive	 tactics	 li ke	 ostracism,
vicious	 gossip,	 and	 indirect	 vendettas.	 Boys,	 by	 an d	 large,	 simply
continue	being	confrontational	when	angered,	oblivi ous	to	these	more
covert	strategies. 6	This	is	just	one	of	many	ways	that	boys—and	later,
men—are	 less	 sophisticated	 than	 the	 opposite	 sex	 in	 t he	 byways	 of
emotional	life.
When	girls	play	together,	they	do	so	in	small,	intima te	groups,	with
an	 emphasis	 on	 minimizing	 hostility	 and	 maximizing	 coope ration,
while	 boys’	 games	 are	 in	 larger	 groups,	 with	 an	 empha sis	 on
competition.	One	key	difference	can	be	seen	in	what	 happens	when
games	boys	or	girls	are	playing	get	disrupted	by	some one	getting	hurt.
If	a	boy	who	has	gotten	hurt	gets	upset,	he	is	expe cted	to	get	out	of
the	way	and	stop	crying	so	the	game	can	go	on.	If	th e	same	happens
among	a	group	of	girls	who	are	playing,	the	 game	stops 	while	everyone
======================================== [Página 154] ========================================

gathers	around	to	help	the	girl	who	is	crying.	This 	difference	between
boys	and	girls	at	play	epitomizes	what	Harvard’s	Caro l	Gilligan	points
to	 as	 a	 key	 disparity	 between	 the	 sexes:	 boys	 take	 pride	 in	 a	 lone,
tough-minded	independence	and	autonomy,	while	girls	see	thems elves
as	 part	 of	 a	 web	 of	 connectedness.	 Thus	 boys	 are	 th reatened	 by
anything	 that	 might	 challenge	 their	 independence,	 wh ile	 girls	 are
more	threatened	by	a	rupture	in	their	relationships. 	And,	as	Deborah
Tannen	has	pointed	out	in	her	book	 You	Just	Don’t	Understand ,	these
differing	 perspectives	 mean	 that	 men	 and	 women	 want	 an d	 expect
very	different	things	out	of	a	conversation,	with	me n	content	to	talk
about	“things,”	while	women	seek	emotional	connection.
In	 short,	 these	 contrasts	 in	 schooling	 in	 the	 emotio ns	 foster	 very
different	skills,	with	girls	becoming	“adept	at	read ing	both	verbal	and
nonverbal	 emotional	 signals,	 at	 expressing	 and	 communi cating	 their
feelings,”	and	boys	becoming	adept	at	“minimizing	emoti ons	having
to	 do	 with	 vulnerability,	 guilt,	 fear	 and	 hurt”. 7	 Evidence	 for	 these
different	stances	is	very	strong	in	the	scientific	 literature.	Hundreds	of
studies	 have	 found,	 for	 example,	 that	 on	 average	 wome n	 are	 more
empathic	 than	 men,	 at	 least	 as	 measured	 by	 the	 ability 	 to	 read
someone	else’s	unstated	feelings	from	facial	expressi on,	tone	of	voice,
and	 other	 nonverbal	 cues.	 Likewise,	 it	 is	 generally 	 easier	 to	 read
feelings	 from	 a	 woman’s	 face	 than	 a	 man’s;	 while	 there 	 is	 no
difference	in	facial	expressiveness	among	very	young 	boys	and	girls,
as	 they	 go	 through	 the	 elementary-school	 grades	 boys 	 become	 less
expressive,	 girls	 more	 so.	 This	 may	 partly	 reflect	 an other	 key
difference:	 women,	 on	 average,	 experience	 the	 entire 	 range	 of
emotions	with	greater	intensity	and	more	volatility	t han	men—in	this
sense,	women	are	more	“emotional”	than	men. 8
All	 of	 this	 means	 that,	 in	 general,	 women	 come	 into	 a	 marriage
groomed	 for	 the	 role	 of	 emotional	 manager,	 while	 men	 a rrive	 with
much	 less	 appreciation	 of	 the	 importance	 of	 this	 task 	 for	 helping	 a
relationship	survive.	Indeed,	the	most	important	element	for	w omen—
but	not	for	men—in	satisfaction	with	their	relationsh ip	reported	in	a
study	 of	 264	 couples	 was	 the	 sense	 that	 the	 couple	 has	 “good
communication.” 9	 Ted	 Huston,	 a	 psychologist	 at	 the	 University	 of
Texas	 who	 has	 studied	 couples	 in	 depth,	 observes,	 “ For	 the	 wives,
intimacy	 means	 talking	 things	 over,	 especially	 talkin g	 about	 the
relationship	itself.	The	men,	by	and	large,	don’t	un derstand	what	the
wives	want	from	them.	They	say,	‘I	want	to	do	things	 with	her,	and	all
she	wants	to	do	is	talk.’	”	During	courtship,	Huston 	found,	men	were
======================================== [Página 155] ========================================

much	more	willing	to	spend	time	talking	in	ways	that	s uited	the	wish
for	intimacy	of	their	wives-to-be.	But	once	married,	 as	time	went	on
the	men—especially	in	more	traditional	couples—spent	le ss	and	less
time	talking	in	this	way	with	their	wives,	finding	a 	sense	of	closeness
simply	 in	 doing	 things	 like	 gardening	 together	 rathe r	 than	 talking
things	over.
This	growing	silence	on	the	part	of	husbands	may	be	 partly	due	to
the	fact	that,	if	anything,	men	are	a	bit	Pollyannai sh	about	the	state	of
their	marriage,	while	their	wives	are	attuned	to	the 	trouble	spots:	in
one	study	of	marriages,	men	had	a	rosier	view	than	th eir	wives	of	just
about	 everything	 in	 their	 relationship—lovemaking,	 fi nances,	 ties
with	in-laws,	how	well	they	listened	to	each	other, 	how	much	their
flaws	 mattered. 10	 Wives,	 in	 general,	 are	 more	 vocal	 about	 their
complaints	 than	 are	 their	 husbands,	 particularly	 amon g	 unhappy
couples.	Combine	men’s	rosy	view	of	marriage	with	thei r	aversion	to
emotional	confrontations,	and	it	is	clear	why	wives	 so	often	complain
that	their	husbands	try	to	wiggle	out	of	discussing 	the	troubling	things
about	 their	 relationship.	 (Of	 course	 this	 gender	 di fference	 is	 a
generalization,	 and	 is	 not	 true	 in	 every	 case;	 a	 ps ychiatrist	 friend
complained	 that	 in	 his	 marriage	 his	 wife	 is	 reluctant 	 to	 discuss
emotional	 matters	 between	 them,	 and	 he	 is	 the	 one	 who	 is	 left	 to
bring	them	up.)
The	slowness	of	men	to	bring	up	problems	in	a	relatio nship	is	no
doubt	 compounded	 by	 their	 relative	 lack	 of	 skill	 whe n	 it	 comes	 to
reading	facial	expressions	of	emotions.	Women,	for	ex ample,	are	more
sensitive	to	a	sad	expression	on	a	man’s	face	than	are	men	in	dete cting
sadness	from	a	woman’s	expression. 11	Thus	a	woman	has	to	be	all	the
sadder	for	a	man	to	notice	her	feelings	in	the	first 	place,	let	alone	for
him	to	raise	the	question	of	what	is	making	her	so	sad.
Consider	 the	 implications	 of	 this	 emotional	 gender	 ga p	 for	 how
couples	 handle	 the	 grievances	 and	 disagreements	 that 	 any	 intimate
relationship	 inevitably	 spawns.	 In	 fact,	 specific	 i ssues	 such	 as	 how
often	a	couple	has	sex,	how	to	discipline	the	child ren,	or	how	much
debt	and	savings	a	couple	feels	comfortable	with	are 	not	what	make
or	 break	 a	 marriage.	 Rather,	 it	 is	 how	 a	 couple	 discusses	 such	 sore
points	that	matters	more	for	the	fate	of	their	marriag e.	Simply	having
reached	an	agreement	about	 how	to 	disagree	is	key	to	marital	survival;
men	 and	 women	 have	 to	 overcome	 the	 innate	 gender	 diffe rences	 in
approaching	 rocky	 emotions.	 Failing	 this,	 couples	 ar e	 vulnerable	 to
emotional	rifts	that	eventually	can	tear	their	relat ionship	apart.	As	we
======================================== [Página 156] ========================================

shall	 see,	 these	 rifts	 are	 far	 more	 likely	 to	 develo p	 if	 one	 or	 both
partners	have	certain	deficits	in	emotional	intelligence.
MARITAL	FAULT	LINE
Fred:	Did	you	pick	up	my	dry	cleaning?
Ingrid:	(In	a	mocking	tone)	“Did	you	pick	up	my	dry	c leaning.”	Pick
up	your	own	damn	dry	cleaning.	What	am	I,	your	maid?
Fred:	Hardly.	If	you	were	a	maid,	at	least	you’d	know	how	to	clea n.
If	this	were	dialogue	from	a	sitcom,	it	might	be	amusin g.	But	this
painfully	caustic	interchange	was	between	a	couple	 who	(perhaps	not
surprisingly)	 divorced	 within	 the	 next	 few	 years. 12	 Their	 encounter
took	 place	 in	 a	 laboratory	 run	 by	 John	 Gottman,	 a	 Un iversity	 of
Washington	 psychologist	 who	 has	 done	 perhaps	 the	 mos t	 detailed
analysis	 ever	 of	 the	 emotional	 glue	 that	 binds	 coupl es	 together	 and
the	corrosive	feelings	that	can	destroy	marriages. 13	In	his	laboratory,
couples’	conversations	are	videotaped	and	then	subj ected	to	hours	of
microanalysis	designed	to	reveal	the	subterranean	emo tional	currents
at	 play.	 This	 mapping	 of	 the	 fault	 lines	 that	 may	 lea d	 a	 couple	 to
divorce	 makes	 a	 convincing	 case	 for	 the	 crucial	 role 	 of	 emotional
intelligence	in	the	survival	of	a	marriage.
During	 the	 last	 two	 decades	 Gottman	 has	 tracked	 the	 ups	 and
downs	 of	 more	 than	 two	 hundred	 couples,	 some	 just	 new lyweds,
others	 married	 for	 decades.	 Gottman	 has	 charted	 the	 e motional
ecology	 of	 marriage	 with	 such	 precision	 that,	 in	 one 	 study,	 he	 was
able	 to	 predict	 which	 couples	 seen	 in	 his	 lab	 (like 	 Fred	 and	 Ingrid,
whose	 discussion	 of	 getting	 the	 dry	 cleaning	 was	 so 	 acrimonious)
would	divorce	within	three	years	with	 94	percent	accuracy ,	a	precision
unheard	of	in	marital	studies!
The	 power	 of	 Gottman’s	 analysis	 comes	 from	 his	 painsta king
method	 and	 the	 thoroughness	 of	 his	 probes.	 While	 the 	 couples	 talk,
sensors	 record	 the	 slightest	 flux	 in	 their	 physiolo gy;	 a	 second-by-
second	 analysis	 of	 their	 facial	 expressions	 (using	 the	 system	 for
reading	emotions	developed	by	Paul	Ekman)	detects	the 	most	fleeting
and	subtle	nuance	of	feeling.	After	their	session,	 each	partner	comes
separately	to	the	lab	and	watches	a	videotape	of	th e	conversation,	and
narrates	his	or	her	secret	thoughts	during	the	heat ed	moments	of	the
exchange.	The	result	is	akin	to	an	emotional	X-ray	of	the	marria ge.
======================================== [Página 157] ========================================

An	early	warning	signal	that	a	marriage	is	in	danger,	Gottman	fi nds,
is	harsh	criticism.	In	a	healthy	marriage	husband	and 	wife	feel	free	to
voice	a	complaint.	But	too	often	in	the	heat	of	ange r	complaints	are
expressed	 in	 a	 destructive	 fashion,	 as	 an	 attack	 on 	 the	 spouse’s
character.	For	example,	Pamela	and	her	daughter	went	 shoe	shopping
while	her	husband,	Tom,	went	to	a	bookstore.	They	ag reed	to	meet	in
front	of	the	post	office	in	an	hour,	and	then	go	to 	a	matinee.	Pamela
was	prompt,	but	there	was	no	sign	of	Tom.	“Where	is	h e?	The	movie
starts	in	ten	minutes,”	Pamela	complained	to	her	daugh ter.	“If	there’s
a	way	for	your	father	to	screw	something	up,	he	will.”
When	Tom	showed	up	ten	minutes	later,	happy	about	ha ving	run
into	a	friend	and	apologizing	for	being	late,	Pamela 	lashed	out	with
sarcasm:	“That’s	 okay—it	 gave	 us	 a	 chance	 to	 discuss	 your	 amazing
ability	to	screw	up	every	single	plan	we	make.	You’r e	so	thoughtless
and	self-centered!”
Pamela’s	complaint	is	more	than	that:	it	is	a	characte r	assassination,
a	critique	of	the	person,	not	the	deed.	In	fact,	To m	had	apologized.
But	 for	 this	 lapse	 Pamela	 brands	 him	 as	 “thoughtless	 and	 self-
centered.”	 Most	 couples	 have	 moments	 like	 this	 from	 ti me	 to	 time,
where	a	complaint	about	something	a	partner	has	done	 is	voiced	as	an
attack	 against	 the	 person	 rather	 than	 the	 deed.	 But 	 these	 harsh
personal	criticisms	have	a	far	more	corrosive	emotiona l	impact	than
do	 more	 reasoned	 complaints.	 And	 such	 attacks,	 perhap s
understandably,	become	more	likely	the	more	a	husband	 or	wife	feels
their	complaints	go	unheard	or	ignored.
The	 differences	 between	 complaints	 and	 personal	 crit icisms	 are
simple.	In	a	complaint,	a	wife	states	specifically	wh at	is	upsetting	her,
and	 criticizes	 her	 husband’s	 action ,	 not	 her	 husband,	 saying	 how	 it
made	her	feel:	“When	you	forgot	to	pick	up	my	clothes	at	the	clean er’s
it	made	me	feel	like	you	don’t	care	about	me.”	It	is	a n	expression	of
basic	emotional	intelligence:	assertive,	not	bellige rent	or	passive.	But
in	 a	 personal	 criticism	 she	 uses	 the	 specific	 grieva nce	 to	 launch	 a
global	attack	on	her	husband:	“You’re	always	so	sel fish	and	uncaring.
It	 just	 proves	 I	 can’t	 trust	 you	 to	 do	 anything	 rig ht.”	 This	 kind	 of
criticism	 leaves	 the	 person	 on	 the	 receiving	 end	 fee ling	 ashamed,
disliked,	blamed,	and	defective—all	of	which	are	more	 likely	to	lead
to	a	defensive	response	than	to	steps	to	improve	things.
All	the	more	so	when	the	criticism	comes	laden	with	co ntempt,	a
particularly	destructive	emotion.	Contempt	comes	easil y	with	anger;	it
is	usually	expressed	not	just	in	the	words	used,	bu t	also	in	a	tone	of
======================================== [Página 158] ========================================

voice	 and	 an	 angry	 expression.	 Its	 most	 obvious	 form, 	 of	 course,	 is
mockery	or	insult—“jerk,”	“bitch,”	“wimp.”	But	just	as 	hurtful	is	the
body	language	that	conveys	contempt,	particularly	th e	sneer	or	curled
lip	that	are	the	universal	facial	signals	for	disgu st,	or	a	rolling	of	the
eyes,	as	if	to	say,	“Oh,	brother!”
Contempt’s	 facial	 signature	 is	 a	 contraction	 of	 the	 “dimpler,”	 the
muscle	 that	 pulls	 the	 corners	 of	 the	 mouth	 to	 the	 sid e	 (usually	 the
left)	 while	 the	 eyes	 roll	 upward.	 When	 one	 spouse	 f lashes	 this
expression,	the	other,	in	a	tacit	emotional	exchange ,	registers	a	jump
in	 heart	 rate	 of	 two	 or	 three	 beats	 per	 minute.	 This 	 hidden
conversation	 takes	 its	 toll;	 if	 a	 husband	 shows	 con tempt	 regularly,
Gottman	 found,	 his	 wife	 will	 be	 more	 prone	 to	 a	 range 	 of	 health
problems,	 from	 frequent	 colds	 and	 flus	 to	 bladder	 and 	 yeast
infections,	 as	 well	 as	 gastrointestinal	 symptoms.	 And 	 when	 a	 wife’s
face	 shows	 disgust,	 a	 near	 cousin	 of	 contempt,	 four	 or	 more	 times
within	a	fifteen-minute	conversation,	it	is	a	silent 	sign	that	the	couple
is	likely	to	separate	within	four	years.
Of	course,	an	occasional	show	of	contempt	or	disgust 	will	not	undo
a	marriage.	Rather,	such	emotional	volleys	are	akin	t o	smoking	and
high	 cholesterol	 as	 risk	 factors	 for	 heart	 disease—t he	 more	 intense
and	prolonged,	the	greater	the	danger.	On	the	road	 to	divorce,	one	of
these	 factors	 predicts	 the	 next,	 in	 an	 escalating	 s cale	 of	 misery.
Habitual	criticism	and	contempt	or	disgust	are	danger	 signs	because
they	indicate	that	a	husband	or	wife	has	made	a	sile nt	judgment	for
the	worse	about	their	partner.	In	his	or	her	though ts,	the	spouse	is	the
subject	of	constant	condemnation.	Such	negative	and	 hostile	thinking
leads	naturally	to	attacks	that	make	the	partner	on	 the	receiving	end
defensive—or	ready	to	counterattack	in	return.
The	two	arms	of	the	fight-or-flight	response	each	re present	ways	a
spouse	can	respond	to	an	attack.	The	most	obvious	is 	to	fight	back,
lashing	out	in	anger.	That	route	typically	ends	in	 a	fruitless	shouting
match.	But	the	alternative	response,	fleeing,	can	be 	more	pernicious,
particularly	when	the	“flight”	is	a	retreat	into	stony	silen ce.
Stonewalling	 is	 the	 ultimate	 defense.	 The	 stonewalle r	 just	 goes
blank,	 in	 effect	 withdrawing	 from	 the	 conversation	 b y	 responding
with	 a	 stony	 expression	 and	 silence.	 Stonewalling	 s ends	 a	 powerful,
unnerving	 message,	 something	 like	 a	 combination	 of	 icy 	 distance,
superiority,	and	distaste.	Stonewalling	showed	up	ma inly	in	marriages
that	were	heading	for	trouble;	in	85	percent	of	the se	cases	it	was	the
husband	 who	 stonewalled	 in	 response	 to	 a	 wife	 who	 a ttacked	 with
======================================== [Página 159] ========================================

criticism	 and	 contempt. 14	 As	 a	 habitual	 response	 stonewalling	 is
devastating	to	the	health	of	a	relationship:	it	cut s	off	all	possibility	of
working	out	disagreements.
TOXIC	THOUGHTS
The	 children	 are	 being	 rambunctious,	 and	 Martin,	 the ir	 father,	 is
getting	 annoyed.	 He	 turns	 to	 his	 wife,	 Melanie,	 and	 says	 in	 a	 sharp
tone,	“Dear,	don’t	you	think	the	kids	could	quiet	down?”
His	actual	thought:	“She’s	too	easy	on	the	kids.”
Melanie,	 responding	 to	 his	 ire,	 feels	 a	 surge	 of	 an ger.	 Her	 face
grows	taut,	her	brows	knit	in	a	frown,	and	she	repl ies,	“The	kids	are
having	a	good	time.	Anyhow,	they’ll	be	going	up	to	bed	soon.”
Her	thought:	“There	he	goes	again,	complaining	all	the	time.”
Martin	 now	 is	 visibly	 enraged.	 He	 leans	 forward	 menac ingly,	 his
fists	clenched,	as	he	says	in	an	annoyed	tone,	“Sho uld	I	put	them	to
bed	now?”
His	thought:	“She	opposes	me	in	everything.	I’d	better	take	ov er.”
Melanie,	suddenly	frightened	by	Martin’s	wrath,	say s	meekly,	“No,
I’ll	put	them	to	bed	right	away.”
Her	thought:	“He’s	getting	out	of	control—he	could	h urt	the	kids.
I’d	better	give	in.”
These	 parallel	 conversations—the	 spoken	 and	 the	 sile nt—are
reported	 by	 Aaron	 Beck,	 the	 founder	 of	 cognitive	 th erapy,	 as	 an
example	 of	 the	 kinds	 of	 thinking	 that	 can	 poison	 a	 ma rriage. 15	 The
real	 emotional	 exchange	 between	 Melanie	 and	 Martin	 i s	 shaped	 by
their	 thoughts,	 and	 those	 thoughts,	 in	 turn,	 are	 de termined	 by
another,	 deeper	 layer,	 which	 Beck	 calls	 “automatic	 t houghts”—
fleeting,	 background	 assumptions	 about	 oneself	 and	 t he	 people	 in
one’s	life	that	reflect	our	deepest	emotional	attitu des.	For	Melanie	the
background	thought	is	something	like,	“He’s	always	bu llying	me	with
his	anger.”	For	Martin,	the	key	thought	is,	“She	ha s	no	right	to	treat
me	like	this.”	Melanie	feels	like	an	innocent	victim	 in	their	marriage,
and	 Martin	 feels	 righteous	 indignation	 at	 what	 he	 f eels	 is	 unjust
treatment.
Thoughts	 of	 being	 an	 innocent	 victim	 or	 of	 righteous 	 indignation
are	typical	of	partners	in	troubled	marriages,	continually	f ueling	anger
and	 hurt. 16	 Once	 distressing	 thoughts	 such	 as	 righteous	 indign ation
become	 automatic,	 they	 are	 self-confirming:	 the	 partne r	 who	 feels
======================================== [Página 160] ========================================

victimized	 is	 constantly	 scanning	 everything	 his	 par tner	 does	 that
might	 confirm	 the	 view	 that	 she	 is	 victimizing	 him,	 ign oring	 or
discounting	any	acts	of	kindness	on	her	part	that	w ould	question	or
disconfirm	that	view.
These	 thoughts	 are	 powerful;	 they	 trip	 the	 neural	 a larm	 system.
Once	the	husband’s	thought	of	being	victimized	trigg ers	an	emotional
hijacking,	he	will	for	the	time	being	easily	call	to 	mind	and	ruminate
on	 a	 list	 of	 grievances	 that	 remind	 him	 of	 the	 ways	 s he	 victimizes
him,	while	not	recalling	anything	she	may	have	done	i n	their	entire
relationship	 that	 would	 disconfirm	 the	 view	 that	 he	 is	 an	 innocent
victim.	It	puts	his	spouse	in	a	no-win	situation:	ev en	things	she	does
that	are	intentionally	kind	can	be	reinterpreted	wh en	viewed	through
such	a	negative	lens	and	dismissed	as	feeble	attempts 	to	deny	she	is	a
victimizer.
Partners	who	are	free	of	such	distress-triggering	v iews	can	entertain
a	 more	 benign	 interpretation	 of	 what	 is	 going	 on	 in	 the	 same
situations,	and	so	are	less	likely	to	have	such	a	h ijacking,	or	if	they
do,	 tend	 to	 recover	 from	 it	 more	 readily.	 The	 general 	 template	 for
thoughts	 that	 maintain	 or	 alleviate	 distress	 follows 	 the	 pattern
outlined	in	 Chapter	6 	by	psychologist	Martin	Seligman	for	pessimistic
and	 optimistic	 outlooks.	 The	 pessimistic	 view	 is	 that 	 the	 partner	 is
inherently	 flawed	 in	 a	 way	 that	 cannot	 change	 and	 t hat	 guarantees
misery:	“He’s	selfish	and	self-absorbed;	that’s	the	wa y	he	was	brought
up	and	that’s	the	way	he	will	always	be;	he	expects 	me	to	wait	on	him
hand	 and	 foot	 and	 he	 couldn’t	 care	 less	 about	 how	 I 	 feel.”	 The
contrasting	 optimistic	 view	 would	 be	 something	 like:	 “He’s	 being
demanding	now,	but	he’s	been	thoughtful	in	the	past; 	maybe	he’s	in	a
bad	mood—I	wonder	if	something’s	bothering	him	about	hi s	work.”
This	is	a	view	that	does	not	write	off	the	husband	 (or	the	marriage)	as
irredeemably	damaged	and	hopeless.	Instead	it	sees	a	 bad	moment	as
due	 to	 circumstances	 that	 can	 change.	 The	 first	 atti tude	 brings
continual	distress;	the	second	soothes.
Partners	 who	 take	 the	 pessimistic	 stance	 are	 extremel y	 prone	 to
emotional	hijackings;	they	get	angry,	hurt,	or	other wise	distressed	by
things	 their	 spouses	 do,	 and	 they	 stay	 disturbed	 on ce	 the	 episode
begins.	 Their	 internal	 distress	 and	 pessimistic	 atti tude,	 of	 course,
makes	it	far	more	likely	they	will	resort	to	criticis m	and	contempt	in
confronting	 the	 partner,	 which	 in	 turn	 heightens	 th e	 likelihood	 of
defensiveness	and	stonewalling.
Perhaps	 the	 most	 virulent	 of	 such	 toxic	 thoughts	 are 	 found	 in
======================================== [Página 161] ========================================

husbands	who	are	physically	violent	to	their	wives. 	A	study	of	violent
husbands	by	psychologists	at	Indiana	University	fou nd	that	these	men
think	like	schoolyard	bullies:	they	read	hostile	in tent	into	even	neutral
actions	by	their	wives,	and	use	this	misreading	to	j ustify	to	themselves
their	 own	 violence	 (men	 who	 are	 sexually	 aggressive	 with	 dates	 do
something	 similar,	 viewing	 the	 women	 with	 suspicion	 an d	 so
disregarding	 their	 objections). 17	 As	 we	 saw	 in	 Chapter	 7 ,	 such	 men
are	 particularly	 threatened	 by	 perceived	 slights,	 r ejection,	 or	 public
embarrassment	 by	 their	 wives.	 A	 typical	 scenario	 that 	 triggers
thoughts	 “justifying”	 violence	 in	 wife-batterers:	 “ You	 are	 at	 a	 social
gathering	 and	 you	 notice	 that	 for	 the	 past	 half	 hou r	 your	 wife	 has
been	talking	and	laughing	with	the	same	attractive	ma n.	He	seems	to
be	flirting	with	her.”	When	these	men	perceive	their 	wives	as	doing
something	suggesting	rejection	or	abandonment,	their	 reactions	run	to
indignation	and	outrage.	Presumably,	automatic	though ts	like	“She’s
going	to	leave	me”	are	triggers	for	an	emotional	hija cking	in	which
battering	 husbands	 respond	 impulsively,	 as	 the	 resea rchers	 put	 it,
with	“incompetent	behavioral	responses”—they	become	violent .18
FLOODING	THE	SWAMPING	OF	A	MARRIAGE
The	net	effect	of	these	distressing	attitudes	is	to 	create	incessant	crisis,
since	they	trigger	emotional	hijackings	more	often	an d	make	it	harder
to	 recover	 from	 the	 resulting	 hurt	 and	 rage.	 Gottman	 uses	 the	 apt
term	flooding 	 for	 this	 susceptibility	 to	 frequent	 emotional	 distr ess;
flooded	 husbands	 or	 wives	 are	 so	 overwhelmed	 by	 thei r	 partner’s
negativity	 and	 their	 own	 reaction	 to	 it	 that	 they	 a re	 swamped	 by
dreadful,	out-of-control	feelings.	People	who	are	f looded	cannot	hear
without	distortion	or	respond	with	clear-headedness ;	they	find	it	hard
to	organize	their	thinking,	and	they	fall	back	on	p rimitive	reactions.
They	just	want	things	to	stop,	or	want	to	run	or,	s ometimes,	to	strike
back.	Flooding	is	a	self-perpetuating	emotional	hijacking.
Some	 people	 have	 high	 thresholds	 for	 flooding,	 easil y	 enduring
anger	and	contempt,	while	others	may	be	triggered	the 	moment	their
spouse	makes	a	mild	criticism.	The	technical	descripti on	of	flooding	is
in	terms	of	heart	rate	rise	from	calm	levels. 19	At	rest,	women’s	heart
rates	 are	 about	 82	 beats	 per	 minute,	 men’s	 about	 72	 ( the	 specific
heart	rate	varies	mainly	according	to	a	person’s	bod y	size).	Flooding
begins	at	about	10	beats	per	minute	above	a	person’s 	resting	rate;	if
======================================== [Página 162] ========================================

the	heart	rate	reaches	100	beats	per	minute	(as	it	e asily	can	do	during
moments	of	rage	or	tears),	then	the	body	is	pumping	ad renaline	and
other	 hormones	 that	 keep	 the	 distress	 high	 for	 some	 t ime.	 The
moment	of	emotional	hijacking	is	apparent	from	the	hear t	rate:	it	can
jump	10,	20,	or	even	as	many	as	30	beats	per	minute	wi thin	the	space
of	 a	 single	 heartbeat.	 Muscles	 tense;	 it	 can	 seem	 ha rd	 to	 breathe.
There	 is	 a	 swamp	 of	 toxic	 feelings,	 an	 unpleasant	 wa sh	 of	 fear	 and
anger	that	seems	inescapable	and,	subjectively,	take s	“forever”	to	get
over.	At	this	point—full	hijacking—a	person’s	emotions 	are	so	intense,
their	perspective	so	narrow,	and	their	thinking	so	 confused	that	there
is	 no	 hope	 of	 taking	 the	 other’s	 viewpoint	 or	 settl ing	 things	 in	 a
reasonable	way.
Of	 course,	 most	 husbands	 and	 wives	 have	 such	 intense 	 moments
from	time	to	time	when	they	fight—it’s	only	natural.	Th e	problem	for
a	 marriage	 begins	 when	 one	 or	 another	 spouse	 feels	 f looded	 almost
continually.	Then	the	partner	feels	overwhelmed	by	t he	other	partner,
is	 always	 on	 guard	 for	 an	 emotional	 assault	 or	 injus tice,	 becomes
hypervigilant	for	any	sign	of	attack,	insult,	or	gr ievance,	and	is	sure	to
overreact	 to	 even	 the	 least	 sign.	 If	 a	 husband	 is	 i n	 such	 a	 state,	 his
wife	 saying,	 “Honey,	 we’ve	 got	 to	 talk,”	 can	 elicit 	 the	 reactive
thought,	 “She’s	 picking	 a	 fight	 again,”	 and	 so	 trig ger	 flooding.	 It
becomes	harder	and	harder	to	recover	from	the	physiol ogical	arousal,
which	in	turn	makes	it	easier	for	innocuous	exchange s	to	be	seen	in	a
sinister	light,	triggering	flooding	all	over	again.
This	 is	 perhaps	 the	 most	 dangerous	 turning	 point	 for 	 marriage,	 a
catastrophic	shift	in	the	relationship.	The	flooded 	partner	has	come	to
think	the	worst	of	the	spouse	virtually	all	the	time ,	reading	everything
she	 does	 in	 a	 negative	 light.	 Small	 issues	 become	 majo r	 battles;
feelings	 are	 hurt	 continually.	 With	 time,	 the	 partne r	 who	 is	 being
flooded	starts	to	see	any	and	all	problems	in	the	mar riage	as	severe
and	impossible	to	fix,	since	the	flooding	itself	sab otages	any	attempt
to	work	things	out.	As	this	continues	it	begins	to	 seem	useless	to	talk
things	over,	and	the	partners	try	to	soothe	their	t roubled	feelings	on
their	 own.	 They	 start	 leading	 parallel	 lives,	 essen tially	 living	 in
isolation	from	each	other,	and	feel	alone	within	the 	marriage.	All	too
often,	Gottman	finds,	the	next	step	is	divorce.
In	this	trajectory	toward	divorce	the	tragic	conseq uences	of	deficits
in	emotional	competences	are	self-evident.	As	a	coupl e	gets	caught	in
the	reverberating	cycle	of	criticism	and	contempt,	de fensiveness	and
stonewalling,	 distressing	 thoughts	 and	 emotional	 flo oding,	 the	 cycle
======================================== [Página 163] ========================================

itself	 reflects	 a	 disintegration	 of	 emotional	 self-a wareness	 and	 self-
control,	of	empathy	and	the	abilities	to	soothe	each	other	and 	oneself.
MEN:	THE	VULNERABLE	SEX
Back	 to	 gender	 differences	 in	 emotional	 life,	 which	 prove	 to	 be	 a
hidden	 spur	 to	 marital	 meltdowns.	 Consider	 this	 findi ng:	 Even	 after
thirty-five	 or	 more	 years	 of	 marriage,	 there	 is	 a	 bas ic	 distinction
between	 husbands	 and	 wives	 in	 how	 they	 regard	 emotio nal
encounters.	 Women,	 on	 average,	 do	 not	 mind	 plunging	 i nto	 the
unpleasantness	of	a	marital	squabble	nearly	so	much	a s	do	the	men	in
their	lives.	That	conclusion,	reached	in	a	study	by 	Robert	Levenson	at
the	University	of	California	at	Berkeley,	is	based	 on	the	testimony	of
151	 couples,	 all	 in	 long-lasting	 marriages.	 Levenson 	 found	 that
husbands	 uniformly	 found	 it	 unpleasant,	 even	 aversiv e,	 to	 become
upset	during	a	marital	disagreement,	while	their	wive s	did	not	mind	it
much. 20
Husbands	 are	 prone	 to	 flooding	 at	 a	 lower	 intensity	 of	 negativity
than	 are	 their	 wives;	 more	 men	 than	 women	 react	 to	 the ir	 spouse’s
criticism	 with	 flooding.	 Once	 flooded,	 husbands	 secr ete	 more
adrenaline	into	their	bloodstream,	and	the	adrenaline	flow	i s	triggered
by	 lower	 levels	 of	 negativity	 on	 their	 wife’s	 part; 	 it	 takes	 husbands
longer	 to	 recover	 physiologically	 from	 flooding. 21	 This	 suggests	 the
possibility	that	the	stoic,	Clint	Eastwood	type	of	 male	imperturbability
may	represent	a	defense	against	feeling	emotionally	overwhel med.
The	reason	men	are	so	likely	to	stonewall,	Gottman	pr oposes,	is	to
protect	themselves	from	flooding;	his	research	showed 	that	once	they
began	stonewalling,	their	heart	rates	dropped	by	ab out	ten	beats	per
minute,	 bringing	 a	 subjective	 sense	 of	 relief.	 But—an d	 here’s	 a
paradox—once	the	men	started	stonewalling,	it	was	the 	wives	whose
heart	rate	shot	up	to	levels	signaling	high	distres s.	This	limbic	tango,
with	 each	 sex	 seeking	 comfort	 in	 opposing	 gambits,	 le ads	 to	 a	 very
different	stance	toward	emotional	confrontations:	men 	want	to	avoid
them	as	fervently	as	their	wives	feel	compelled	to	seek	them.
Just	as	men	are	far	more	likely	to	be	stonewallers,	s o	the	women
are	more	likely	to	criticize	their	husbands. 22	This	asymmetry	arises	as
a	result	of	wives	pursuing	their	role	as	emotional	ma nagers.	As	they
try	 to	 bring	 up	 and	 resolve	 disagreements	 and	 grieva nces,	 their
husbands	 are	 more	 reluctant	 to	 engage	 in	 what	 are	 bo und	 to	 be
======================================== [Página 164] ========================================

heated	 discussions.	 As	 the	 wife	 sees	 her	 husband	 wi thdraw	 from
engagement,	 she	 ups	 the	 volume	 and	 intensity	 of	 her	 c omplaint,
starting	 to	 criticize	 him.	 As	 he	 becomes	 defensive	 or 	 stonewalls	 in
return,	 she	 feels	 frustrated	 and	 angry,	 and	 so	 adds 	 contempt	 to
underscore	 the	 strength	 of	 her	 frustration.	 As	 her	 husband	 finds
himself	the	object	of	his	wife’s	criticism	and	contemp t,	he	begins	to
fall	 into	 the	 innocent-victim	 or	 righteous-indignati on	 thoughts	 that
more	 and	 more	 easily	 trigger	 flooding.	 To	 protect	 hims elf	 from
flooding,	he	becomes	more	and	more	defensive	or	simply	 stonewalls
altogether.	 But	 when	 husbands	 stonewall,	 remember,	 it 	 triggers
flooding	in	their	wives,	who	feel	completely	stymied. 	And	as	the	cycle
of	marital	fights	escalates	it	all	too	easily	can	spin	out	of	co ntrol.
HIS	AND	HERS:	MARITAL	ADVICE
Given	the	grim	potential	outcome	of	the	differences	i n	how	men	and
women	deal	with	distressing	feelings	in	their	relati onship,	what	can
couples	do	to	protect	the	love	and	affection	they	f eel	for	each	other—
in	 short,	 what	 protects	 a	 marriage?	 On	 the	 basis	 of	 watching
interaction	in	the	couples	whose	marriages	have	cont inued	to	thrive
over	the	years,	marital	researchers	offer	specific	a dvice	for	men	and
for	women,	and	some	general	words	for	both.
Men	and	women,	in	general,	need	different	emotional	f ine-tuning.
For	 men,	 the	 advice	 is	 not	 to	 sidestep	 conflict,	 but 	 to	 realize	 that
when	their	wife	brings	up	some	grievance	or	disagree ment,	she	may
be	doing	it	as	an	act	of	love,	trying	to	keep	the	r elationship	healthy
and	on	course	(although	there	may	well	be	other	motiv es	for	a	wife’s
hostility).	When	grievances	simmer,	they	build	and	bu ild	in	intensity
until	 there’s	 an	 explosion;	 when	 they	 are	 aired	 and 	 worked	 out,	 it
takes	 the	 pressure	 off.	 But	 husbands	 need	 to	 realiz e	 that	 anger	 or
discontent	 is	 not	 synonymous	 with	 personal	 attack—the ir	 wives’
emotions	 are	 often	 simply	 underliners,	 emphasizing	 the 	 strength	 of
her	feelings	about	the	matter.
Men	also	need	to	be	on	guard	against	short-circuiti ng	the	discussion
by	 offering	 a	 practical	 solution	 too	 early	 on—it’s	 t ypically	 more
important	to	a	wife	that	she	feel	her	husband	hears	 her	complaint	and
empathizes	 with	 her	 feelings 	 about	 the	 matter	 (though	 he	 need	 not
agree	 with	 her).	 She	 may	 hear	 his	 offering	 advice	 as 	 a	 way	 of
dismissing	her	feelings	as	inconsequential.	Husbands	 who	are	able	to
======================================== [Página 165] ========================================

stay	with	their	wives	through	the	heat	of	anger,	rather	than	d ismissing
their	complaints	as	petty,	help	their	wives	feel	hea rd	and	respected.
Most	especially,	wives	want	to	have	their	feelings	 acknowledged	and
respected	as	valid,	even	if	their	husbands	disagree .	More	often	than
not,	when	a	wife	feels	her	view	is	heard	and	her	fe elings	registered,
she	calms	down.
As	for	women,	the	advice	is	quite	parallel.	Since	a	 major	problem
for	 men	 is	 that	 their	 wives	 are	 too	 intense	 in	 voici ng	 complaints,
wives	 need	 to	 make	 a	 purposeful	 effort	 to	 be	 careful 	 not	 to	 attack
their	 husbands—to	 complain	 about	 what	 they	 did,	 but	 n ot	 criticize
them	as	a	person	or	express	contempt.	Complaints	are	n ot	attacks	on
character,	 but	 rather	 a	 clear	 statement	 that	 a	 parti cular	 action	 is
distressing.	 An	 angry	 personal	 attack	 will	 almost	 ce rtainly	 lead	 to	 a
husband’s	 getting	 defensive	 or	 stonewalling,	 which	 will	 be	 all	 the
more	frustrating,	and	only	escalate	the	fight.	It	he lps,	too,	if	a	wife’s
complaints	are	put	in	the	larger	context	of	reassuri ng	her	husband	of
her	love	for	him.
THE	GOOD	FIGHT
The	 morning	 paper	 offers	 an	 object	 lesson	 in	 how	 not 	 to	 resolve
differences	 in	 a	 marriage.	 Marlene	 Lenick	 had	 a	 disp ute	 with	 her
husband,	 Michael:	 he	 wanted	 to	 watch	 the	 Dallas	 Cow boys-
Philadelphia	 Eagles	 game,	 she	 wanted	 to	 watch	 the	 ne ws.	 As	 he
settled	down	to	watch	the	game,	Mrs.	Lenick	told	him	 that	she	had
“had	enough	of	that	football,”	went	into	the	bedroo m	to	fetch	a	.38
caliber	handgun,	and	shot	him	twice	as	he	sat	watchi ng	the	game	in
the	den.	Mrs.	Lenick	was	charged	with	aggravated	as sault	and	freed
on	 a	 $50,000	 bond;	 Mr.	 Lenick	 was	 listed	 in	 good	 co ndition,
recovering	 from	 the	 bullets	 that	 grazed	 his	 abdomen	 a nd	 tunneled
through	his	left	shoulder	blade	and	neck. 23
While	few	marital	fights	are	that	violent—or	that	cos tly—they	offer
a	 prime	 chance	 to	 bring	 emotional	 intelligence	 to	 marr iage.	 For
example,	couples	in	marriages	that	last	tend	to	stick 	to	one	topic,	and
to	 give	 each	 partner	 the	 chance	 to	 state	 their	 poin t	 of	 view	 at	 the
outset. 24	But	these	couples	go	one	important	step	further:	th ey	show
each	other	that	they	are	being	listened	to.	Since	f eeling	heard	is	often
exactly	what	the	aggrieved	partner	really	is	after, 	emotionally	an	act
of	empathy	is	a	masterly	tension	reducer.
======================================== [Página 166] ========================================

Most	 notably	 missing	 in	 couples	 who	 eventually	 divor ce	 are
attempts	by	either	partner	in	an	argument	to	de-escal ate	the	tension.
The	presence	or	absence	of	ways	to	repair	a	rift	is 	a	crucial	difference
between	the	fights	of	couples	who	have	a	healthy	mar riage	and	those
of	couples	who	eventually	end	up	divorcing. 25	The	repair	mechanisms
that	 keep	 an	 argument	 from	 escalating	 into	 a	 dire	 exp losion	 are
simple	 moves	 such	 as	 keeping	 the	 discussion	 on	 track, 	 empathizing,
and	 tension	 reduction.	 These	 basic	 moves	 are	 like	 an 	 emotional
thermostat,	preventing	the	feelings	being	expressed	 from	boiling	over
and	overwhelming	the	partners’	ability	to	focus	on	the	issue	a t	hand.
One	 overall	 strategy	 for	 making	 a	 marriage	 work	 is	 no t	 to
concentrate	 on	 the	 specific	 issues—childrearing,	 sex ,	 money,
housework—that	 couples	 fight	 about,	 but	 rather	 to	 cu ltivate	 a
couple’s	shared	emotional	intelligence,	thereby	impro ving	the	chances
of	working	things	out.	A	handful	of	emotional	compete nces—mainly
being	 able	 to	 calm	 down	 (and	 calm	 your	 partner),	 empat hy,	 and
listening	 well—can	 make	 it	 more	 likely	 a	 couple	 will	 s ettle	 their
disagreements	effectively.	These	make	possible	healthy	disa greements,
the	 “good	 fights”	 that	 allow	 a	 marriage	 to	 flourish	 and	 which
overcome	 the	 negativities	 that,	 if	 left	 to	 grow,	 can 	 destroy	 a
marriage. 26
Of	 course,	 none	 of	 these	 emotional	 habits	 changes	 ov ernight;	 it
takes	persistence	and	vigilance	at	the	very	least.	 Couples	will	be	able
to	make	the	key	changes	in	direct	proportion	to	how	 motivated	they
are	 to	 try.	 Many	 or	 most	 emotional	 responses	 triggere d	 so	 easily	 in
marriage	have	been	sculpted	since	childhood,	first	l earned	in	our	most
intimate	 relationships	 or	 modeled	 for	 us	 by	 our	 paren ts,	 and	 then
brought	to	marriage	fully	formed.	And	so	we	are	primed 	for	certain
emotional	 habits—overreacting	 to	 perceived	 slights,	 s ay,	 or	 shutting
down	at	the	first	sign	of	a	confrontation—even	thoug h	we	may	have
sworn	that	we	would	not	act	like	our	parents.
Calming	Down
Every	strong	emotion	has	at	its	root	an	impulse	to	ac tion;	managing
those	 impulses	 is	 basic	 to	 emotional	 intelligence.	 Th is	 can	 be
particularly	difficult,	though,	in	love	relationshi ps,	where	we	have	so
much	 at	 stake.	 The	 reactions	 triggered	 here	 touch	 on 	 some	 of	 our
deepest	needs—to	be	loved	and	feel	respected,	fears	 of	abandonment
or	 of	 being	 emotionally	 deprived.	 Small	 wonder	 we	 can 	 act	 in	 a
======================================== [Página 167] ========================================

marital	fight	as	though	our	very	survival	were	at	stake.
Even	so,	nothing	gets	resolved	positively	when	husband	or	wi fe	is	in
the	midst	of	an	emotional	hijacking.	One	key	marital	c ompetence	is
for	 partners	 to	 learn	 to	 soothe	 their	 own	 distresse d	 feelings.
Essentially,	this	means	mastering	the	ability	to	reco ver	quickly	from
the	flooding	caused	by	an	emotional	hijacking.	Becau se	the	ability	to
hear,	think,	and	speak	with	clarity	dissolves	durin g	such	an	emotional
peak,	calming	down	is	an	immensely	constructive	step,	 without	which
there	can	be	no	further	progress	in	settling	what’s	at	issue.
Ambitious	couples	can	learn	to	monitor	their	pulse	ra tes	every	five
minutes	or	so	 during	a	troubling	 encounter,	feeling	 the	 pulse	at	the
carotid	artery	a	few	inches	below	the	earlobe	and	j aw	(people	who	do
aerobic	 workouts	 learn	 to	 do	 this	 easily). 27	 Counting	 the	 pulse	 for
fifteen	seconds	and	multiplying	by	four	gives	the	pu lse	rate	in	beats
per	minute.	Doing	so	while	feeling	calm	gives	a	basel ine;	if	the	pulse
rate	 rises	 more	 than,	 say,	 ten	 beats	 per	 minute	 above 	 that	 level,	 it
signals	 the	 beginning	 of	 flooding.	 If	 the	 pulse	 cli mbs	 this	 much,	 a
couple	 needs	 a	 twenty-minute	 break	 from	 each	 other	 to 	 cool	 down
before	 resuming	 the	 discussion.	 Although	 a	 five-minut e	 break	 may
feel	 long	 enough,	 the	 actual	 physiological	 recovery 	 time	 is	 more
gradual.	As	we	saw	in	 Chapter	5 ,	residual	anger	triggers	more	anger;
the	longer	wait	gives	the	body	more	time	to	recover	f rom	the	earlier
arousal.
For	couples	who,	understandably,	find	it	awkward	to 	monitor	heart
rate	 during	 a	 fight,	 it	 is	 simpler	 to	 have	 a	 presta ted	 agreement	 that
allows	one	or	another	partner	to	call	the	time-out	a t	the	first	signs	of
flooding	in	either	partner.	During	that	time-out	per iod,	cooling	down
can	be	helped	along	by	engaging	in	a	relaxation	tec hnique	or	aerobic
exercise	(or	any	of	the	other	methods	we	explored	in 	Chapter	5 )	that
might	help	the	partners	recover	from	the	emotional	hijacking.
Detoxifying	Self-talk
Because	flooding	is	triggered	by	negative	thoughts	 about	the	partner,
it	 helps	 if	 a	 husband	 or	 wife	 who	 is	 being	 upset	 by 	 such	 harsh
judgments	 tackles	 them	 head-on.	 Sentiments	 like	 “I’m	 no t	 going	 to
take	 this	 anymore”	 or	 “I	 don’t	 deserve	 this	 kind	 of	 treatment”	 are
innocent-victim	 or	 righteous-indignation	 slogans.	 As 	 cognitive
therapist	 Aaron	 Beck	 points	 out,	 by	 catching	 these	 thoughts	 and
challenging	them—rather	than	simply	being	enraged	or	h urt	by	them
======================================== [Página 168] ========================================

—a	husband	or	wife	can	begin	to	become	free	of	their	hold. 28
This	requires	monitoring	such	thoughts,	realizing	th at	one	does	not
have	 to	 believe	 them,	 and	 making	 the	 intentional	 effo rt	 to	 bring	 to
mind	evidence	or	perspectives	that	put	them	in	question.	For	ex ample,
a	wife	who	feels	in	the	heat	of	the	moment	that	“he	doesn’t	care	ab out
my	 needs—he’s	 always	 so	 selfish”	 might	 challenge	 the	 t hought	 by
reminding	 herself	 of	 a	 number	 of	 things	 her	 husband	 h as	 done	 that
are,	 in	 fact,	 thoughtful.	 This	 allows	 her	 to	 reframe 	 the	 thought	 as:
“Well,	he	does	show	he	cares	about	me	sometimes,	even	 though	what
he	 just	 did	 was	 thoughtless	 and	 upsetting	 to	 me.”	 Th e	 latter
formulation	opens	the	possibility	of	change	and	a	po sitive	resolution;
the	former	only	foments	anger	and	hurt.
Nondefensive	Listening	and	Speaking
He:	“You’re	shouting!”
She:	“Of	course	I’m	shouting—you	haven’t	heard	a	word 	I’m	saying.
You	just	don’t	listen!”
Listening	is	a	skill	that	keeps	couples	together.	E ven	in	the	heat	of
an	 argument,	 when	 both	 are	 seized	 by	 emotional	 hijack ings,	 one	 or
the	other,	and	sometimes	both,	can	manage	to	listen	pa st	the	anger,
and	 hear	 and	 respond	 to	 a	 partner’s	 reparative	 gest ure.	 Couples
headed	for	divorce,	though,	get	absorbed	in	the	ang er	and	fixated	on
the	 specifics	 of	 the	 issue	 at	 hand,	 not	 managing	 to	 hear—let	 alone
return—any	 peace	 offerings	 that	 might	 be	 implicit	 in	 w hat	 their
partner	 is	 saying.	 Defensiveness	 in	 a	 listener	 take s	 the	 form	 of
ignoring	or	immediately	rebutting	the	spouse’s	complai nt,	reacting	to
it	 as	 though	 it	 were	 an	 attack	 rather	 than	 an	 attemp t	 to	 change
behavior.	Of	course,	in	an	argument	what	one	spouse	 says	is	often	in
the	form	of	an	attack,	or	is	said	with	such	strong	n egativity	that	it	is
hard	to	hear	anything	other	than	an	attack.
Even	in	the	worst	case,	it’s	possible	for	a	couple	 to	purposely	edit
what	 they	 hear,	 ignoring	 the	 hostile	 and	 negative	 p arts	 of	 the
exchange—the	nasty	tone,	the	insult,	the	contemptuous 	criticism—to
hear	the	main	message.	For	this	feat	it	helps	if	part ners	can	remember
to	 see	 each	 other’s	 negativity	 as	 an	 implicit	 stateme nt	 of	 how
important	 the	 issue	 is	 to	 them—a	 demand	 for	 attention	 t o	 be	 paid.
Then	 if	 she	 yells,	 “Will	 you	 stop	 interrupting	 me,	 for	 crissake!”	 he
might	be	more	able	to	say,	without	reacting	overtly	t o	her	hostility,
“Okay,	go	ahead	and	finish.”
======================================== [Página 169] ========================================

The	 most	 powerful	 form	 of	 nondefensive	 listening,	 of	 course,	 is
empathy:	actually	hearing	the	feelings	 behind 	what	is	being	said.	As
we	saw	in	 Chapter	7 ,	for	one	partner	in	a	couple	to	truly	empathize
with	the	other	demands	that	his	own	emotional	reactio ns	calm	down
to	the	point	where	he	is	receptive	enough	for	his	o wn	physiology	to
be	 able	 to	 mirror	 the	 feelings	 of	 his	 partner.	 Witho ut	 this
physiological	 attunement,	 a	 partner’s	 sense	 of	 what	 the	 other	 is
feeling	 is	 likely	 to	 be	 entirely	 off	 base.	 Empathy	 d eteriorates	 when
one’s	 own	 feelings	 are	 so	 strong	 that	 they	 allow	 no 	 physiological
harmonizing,	but	simply	override	everything	else.
One	method	for	effective	emotional	listening,	called	 “mirroring,”	is
commonly	 used	 in	 marital	 therapy.	 When	 one	 partner	 make s	 a
complaint,	 the	 other	 repeats	 it	 back	 in	 her	 own	 word s,	 trying	 to
capture	not	just	the	thought,	but	also	the	feelings 	that	go	with	it.	The
partner	mirroring	checks	with	the	other	to	be	sure	t he	restatement	is
on	 target,	 and	 if	 not,	 tries	 again	 until	 it	 is	 righ t—something	 that
seems	simple,	but	is	surprisingly	tricky	in	execution .29	 The	 effect	 of
being	 mirrored	 accurately	 is	 not	 just	 feeling	 unders tood,	 but	 having
the	added	sense	of	being	in	emotional	attunement.	Tha t	in	itself	can
sometimes	 disarm	 an	 imminent	 attack,	 and	 goes	 far	 toward 	 keeping
discussions	of	grievances	from	escalating	into	fights.
The	 art	 of	 nondefensive	 speaking	 for	 couples	 center s	 around
keeping	what	is	said	to	a	specific	complaint	rather	 than	escalating	to	a
personal	 attack.	 Psychologist	 Haim	 Ginott,	 the	 grandf ather	 of
effective-communication	 programs,	 recommended	 that	 the	 b est
formula	for	a	complaint	is	“XYZ”:	“When	you	did	X,	it	 made	me	feel
Y,	and	I’d	rather	you	did	Z	instead.”	For	example:	“W hen	you	didn’t
call	to	tell	me	you	were	going	to	be	late	for	our	di nner	appointment,	I
felt	unappreciated	and	angry.	I	wish	you’d	call	to	 let	me	know	you’ll
be	late”	instead	of	“You’re	a	thoughtless,	self-cen tered	bastard,”	which
is	how	the	issue	is	all	too	often	put	in	couples’	f ights.	In	short,	open
communication	has	no	bullying,	threats,	or	insults.	N or	does	it	allow
for	any	of	the	innumerable	forms	of	defensiveness—excu ses,	denying
responsibility,	 counterattacking	 with	 a	 criticism,	 a nd	 the	 like.	 Here
again	empathy	is	a	potent	tool.
Finally,	respect	and	love	disarm	hostility	in	marriag e,	as	elsewhere
in	life.	One	powerful	way	to	de-escalate	a	fight	is 	to	let	your	partner
know	that	you	can	see	things	from	the	other	perspect ive,	and	that	this
point	 of	 view	 may	 have	 validity,	 even	 if	 you	 do	 not	 agree	 with	 it
yourself.	Another	is	to	take	responsibility	or	even 	apologize	if	you	see
======================================== [Página 170] ========================================

you	 are	 in	 the	 wrong.	 At	 a	 minimum,	 validation	 means	 at 	 least
conveying	that	you	are	listening,	and	can	acknowled ge	the	emotions
being	expressed,	even	if	you	can’t	go	along	with	th e	argument:	“I	see
you’re	 upset.”	 And	 at	 other	 times,	 when	 there	 is	 no	 fight	 going	 on,
validation	 takes	 the	 form	 of	 compliments,	 finding	 somet hing	 you
genuinely	appreciate	and	voicing	some	praise.	Valida tion,	of	course,	is
a	way	to	help	soothe	your	spouse,	or	to	build	up	emo tional	capital	in
the	form	of	positive	feelings.
Practicing
Because	 these	 maneuvers	 are	 to	 be	 called	 upon	 during 	 the	 heat	 of
confrontation,	when	emotional	arousal	is	sure	to	be	 high,	they	have	to
be	overlearned	if	they	are	to	be	accessible	when	ne eded	most.	This	is
because	 the	 emotional	 brain	 engages	 those	 response	 r outines	 that
were	 learned	 earliest	 in	 life	 during	 repeated	 moments 	 of	 anger	 and
hurt,	and	so	become	dominant.	Memory	and	response	bein g	emotion-
specific,	in	such	moments	reactions	associated	with	c almer	times	are
less	 easy	 to	 remember	 and	 act	 on.	 If	 a	 more	 productive 	 emotional
response	is	unfamiliar	or	not	well	practiced,	it	is	 extremely	difficult	to
try	it	while	upset.	But	if	a	response	is	practiced	 so	that	it	has	become
automatic,	 it	 has	 a	 better	 chance	 of	 finding	 express ion	 during
emotional	 crisis.	 For	 these	 reasons,	 the	 above	 strat egies	 need	 to	 be
tried	 out	 and	 rehearsed	 during	 encounters	 that	 are	 not	 stressful,	 as
well	as	in	the	heat	of	battle,	if	they	are	to	have	 a	chance	to	become	an
acquired	first	response	(or	at	least	a	not-too-bela ted	second	response)
in	the	repertoire	of	the	emotional	circuitry.	In	ess ence,	these	antidotes
to	marital	disintegration	are	a	small	remedial	educati on	in	emotional
intelligence.

Managing	with	Heart
Melburn	 McBroom	 was	 a	 domineering	 boss,	 with	 a	 temper	 that
intimidated	those	who	worked	with	him.	That	fact	might 	have	passed
unremarked	 had	 McBroom	 worked	 in	 an	 office	 or	 factory .	 But
McBroom	was	an	airline	pilot.
One	 day	 in	 1978	 McBroom’s	 plane	 was	 approaching	 Port land,
Oregon,	 when	 he	 noticed	 a	 problem	 with	 the	 landing	 g ear.	 So
McBroom	 went	 into	 a	 holding	 pattern,	 circling	 the	 fi eld	 at	 a	 high
altitude	while	he	fiddled	with	the	mechanism.
As	 McBroom	 obsessed	 about	 the	 landing	 gear,	 the	 plan e’s	 fuel
gauges	steadily	approached	the	empty	level.	But	his	 copilots	were	so
fearful	 of	 McBroom’s	 wrath	 that	 they	 said	 nothing,	 e ven	 as	 disaster
loomed.	The	plane	crashed,	killing	ten	people.
Today	 the	 story	 of	 that	 crash	 is	 told	 as	 a	 cautiona ry	 tale	 in	 the
safety	training	of	airline	pilots. 1	In	80	percent	of	airline	crashes,	pilots
make	 mistakes	 that	 could	 have	 been	 prevented,	 particu larly	 if	 the
crew	 worked	 together	 more	 harmoniously.	 Teamwork,	 open 	 lines	 of
communication,	 cooperation,	 listening,	 and	 speaking	 o ne’s	 mind—
rudiments	 of	 social	 intelligence—are	 now	 emphasized	 in 	 training
pilots,	along	with	technical	prowess.
The	 cockpit	 is	 a	 microcosm	 of	 any	 working	 organizatio n.	 But
lacking	the	dramatic	reality	check	of	an	airplane	crash,	the	d estructive
effects	of	miserable	morale,	intimidated	workers,	or	a rrogant	bosses—
or	any	of	the	dozens	of	other	permutations	of	emotion al	deficiencies
in	 the	 workplace—can	 go	 largely	 unnoticed	 by	 those	 o utside	 the
immediate	scene.	But	the	costs	can	be	read	in	signs	s uch	as	decreased
productivity,	an	increase	in	missed	deadlines,	mistak es	and	mishaps,
and	 an	 exodus	 of	 employees	 to	 more	 congenial	 settings .	 There	 is,
inevitably,	 a	 cost	 to	 the	 bottom	 line	 from	 low	 levels 	 of	 emotional
intelligence	on	the	job.	When	it	is	rampant,	companie s	can	crash	and
burn.
The	cost-effectiveness	of	emotional	intelligence	is	 a	relatively	new
idea	 for	 business,	 one	 some	 managers	 may	 find	 hard	 to	 accept.	 A
======================================== [Página 172] ========================================

study	 of	 250	 executives	 found	 that	 most	 felt	 their	 w ork	 demanded
“their	heads	but	not	their	hearts.”	Many	said	they	 feared	that	feeling
empathy	or	compassion	for	those	they	worked	with	would	put	them	i n
conflict	 with	 their	 organizational	 goals.	 One	 felt	 the	 idea	 of	 sensing
the	feelings	of	those	who	worked	for	him	was	absurd—i t	would,	he
said,	“be	impossible	to	deal	with	people.”	Others	pr otested	that	if	they
were	not	emotionally	aloof	they	would	be	unable	to	ma ke	the	“hard”
decisions	that	business	requires—although	the	likeli hood	is	that	they
would	deliver	those	decisions	more	humanely. 2
That	study	was	done	in	the	1970s,	when	the	business 	environment
was	very	different.	My	argument	is	that	such	attitud es	are	outmoded,
a	 luxury	 of	 a	 former	 day;	 a	 new	 competitive	 reality	 i s	 putting
emotional	 intelligence	 at	 a	 premium	 in	 the	 workplace	 a nd	 in	 the
marketplace.	As	Shoshona	Zuboff,	a	psychologist	at	Har vard	Business
School,	pointed	out	to	me,	“corporations	have	gone	t hrough	a	radical
revolution	 within	 this	 century,	 and	 with	 this	 has	 c ome	 a
corresponding	transformation	of	the	emotional	landscape.	Th ere	was	a
long	 period	 of	 managerial	 domination	 of	 the	 corporate 	 hierarchy
when	 the	 manipulative,	 jungle-fighter	 boss	 was	 rewar ded.	 But	 that
rigid	 hierarchy	 started	 breaking	 down	 in	 the	 1980s	 under	 the	 twin
pressures	 of	 globalization	 and	 information	 technolog y.	 The	 jungle
fighter	 symbolizes	 where	 the	 corporation	 has	 been;	 t he	 virtuoso	 in
interpersonal	skills	is	the	corporate	future.” 3
Some	 of	 the	 reasons	 are	 patently	 obvious—imagine	 the
consequences	 for	 a	 working	 group	 when	 someone	 is	 una ble	 to	 keep
from	exploding	in	anger	or	has	no	sensitivity	about	 what	the	people
around	 him	 are	 feeling.	 All	 the	 deleterious	 effects	 of	 agitation	 on
thinking	reviewed	in	 Chapter	6 	 operate	 in	 the	 workplace	 too:	 When
emotionally	 upset,	 people	 cannot	 remember,	 attend,	 lea rn,	 or	 make
decisions	clearly.	As	one	management	consultant	put	i t,	“Stress	makes
people	stupid.”
On	the	positive	side,	imagine	the	benefits	for	work	 of	being	skilled
in	the	basic	emotional	competences—being	attuned	to	th e	feelings	of
those	we	deal	with,	being	able	to	handle	disagreemen ts	so	they	do	not
escalate,	 having	 the	 ability	 to	 get	 into	 flow	 state s	 while	 doing	 our
work.	Leadership	is	not	domination,	but	the	art	of	p ersuading	people
to	work	toward	a	common	goal.	And,	in	terms	of	managing 	our	own
career,	 there	 may	 be	 nothing	 more	 essential	 than	 reco gnizing	 our
deepest	feelings	about	what	we	do—and	what	changes	mi ght	make	us
more	truly	satisfied	with	our	work.
======================================== [Página 173] ========================================

Some	of	the	less	obvious	reasons	emotional	aptitudes	 are	moving	to
the	 forefront	 of	 business	 skills	 reflect	 sweeping	 c hanges	 in	 the
workplace.	 Let	 me	 make	 my	 point	 by	 tracking	 the	 differ ence	 three
applications	 of	 emotional	 intelligence	 make:	 being	 ab le	 to	 air
grievances	 as	 helpful	 critiques,	 creating	 an	 atmosph ere	 in	 which
diversity	 is	 valued	 rather	 than	 a	 source	 of	 frictio n,	 and	 networking
effectively.
CRITICISM	IS	JOB	ONE
He	was	a	seasoned	engineer,	heading	a	software	develo pment	project,	presenting	the
result	 of	 months	 of	 work	 by	 his	 team	 to	 the	 company’s	 vice 	 president	 for	 product
development.	The	men	and	women	who	had	worked	long	days	we ek	after	week	were
there	 with	 him,	 proud	 to	 present	 the	 fruit	 of	 their	 hard	 lab or.	 But	 as	 the	 engineer
finished	 his	 presentation,	 the	 vice	 president	 turned	 to 	 him	 and	 asked	 sarcastically,
“How	long	have	you	been	out	of	graduate	school?	These	sp ecifications	are	ridiculous.
They	have	no	chance	of	getting	past	my	desk.”
The	engineer,	utterly	embarrassed	and	deflated,	sat	glu mly	through	the	rest	of	the
meeting,	reduced	to	silence.	The	men	and	women	on	his	tea m	made	a	few	desultory—
and	 some	 hostile—remarks	 in	 defense	 of	 their	 effort.	 The	 vice	 president	 was	 then
called	 away	 and	 the	 meeting	 broke	 up	 abruptly,	 leavin g	 a	 residue	 of	 bitterness	 and
anger.
For	the	next	two	weeks	the	engineer	was	obsessed	by	t he	vice	president’s	remarks.
Dispirited	and	depressed,	he	was	convinced	he	would	n ever	get	another	assignment	of
importance	at	the	company,	and	was	thinking	of	leaving,	 even	though	he	enjoyed	his
work	there.
Finally	the	engineer	went	to	see	the	vice	president,	 reminding	him	of	the	meeting,
his	critical	remarks,	and	their	demoralizing	effect.	Then	he 	made	a	carefully	worded
inquiry:	“I’m	a	little	confused	by	what	you	were	tryi ng	to	accomplish.	I	assume	you
were	not	just	trying	to	embarrass	me—did	you	have	some	o ther	goal	in	mind?”
The	vice	president	was	astonished—he	had	no	idea	that	his	r emark,	which	he	meant
as	a	throwaway	line,	had	been	so	devastating.	In	fact, 	he	thought	the	software	plan
was	 promising,	 but	 needed	 more	 work—he	 hadn’t	 meant	 to	 di smiss	 it	 as	 utterly
worthless	 at	 all.	 He	 simply	 had	 not	 realized,	 he	 said,	 how	 poorly	 he	 had	 put	 his
reaction,	nor	that	he	had	hurt	anyone’s	feelings.	And,	b elatedly,	he	apologized.4
It’s	a	question	of	feedback,	really,	of	people	gett ing	the	information
essential	to	keep	their	efforts	on	track.	In	its	or iginal	sense	in	systems
theory,	feedback 	meant	the	exchange	of	data	about	how	one	part	of	a
======================================== [Página 174] ========================================

system	 is	 working,	 with	 the	 understanding	 that	 one	 p art	 affects	 all
others	 in	 the	 system,	 so	 that	 any	 part	 heading	 off	 c ourse	 could	 be
changed	for	the	better.	In	a	company	everyone	is	par t	of	the	system,
and	so	feedback	is	the	lifeblood	of	the	organizatio n—the	exchange	of
information	that	lets	people	know	if	the	job	they	ar e	doing	is	going
well	 or	 needs	 to	 be	 fine-tuned,	 upgraded,	 or	 redire cted	 entirely.
Without	feedback	people	are	in	the	dark;	they	have	 no	idea	how	they
stand	with	their	boss,	with	their	peers,	or	in	terms 	of	what	is	expected
of	them,	and	any	problems	will	only	get	worse	as	time	passes.
In	a	sense,	criticism	is	one	of	the	most	important	tas ks	a	manager
has.	Yet	it’s	also	one	of	the	most	dreaded	and	put	o ff.	And,	like	the
sarcastic	vice	president,	too	many	managers	have	poor ly	mastered	the
crucial	 art	 of	 feedback.	 This	 deficiency	 has	 a	 grea t	 cost:	 just	 as	 the
emotional	 health	 of	 a	 couple	 depends	 on	 how	 well	 the y	 air	 their
grievances,	 so	 do	 the	 effectiveness,	 satisfaction,	 and	 productivity	 of
people	at	work	depend	on	how	they	are	told	about	na gging	problems.
Indeed,	 how	 criticisms	 are	 given	 and	 received	 goes	 a 	 long	 way	 in
determining	how	satisfied	people	are	with	their	work ,	with	those	they
work	with,	and	with	those	to	whom	they	are	responsible.
The	Worst	Way	to	Motivate	Someone
The	 emotional	 vicissitudes	 at	 work	 in	 marriage	 also	 o perate	 in	 the
workplace,	 where	 they	 take	 similar	 forms.	 Criticisms	 a re	 voiced	 as
personal	attacks	rather	than	complaints	that	can	be	 acted	upon;	there
are	 ad	 hominem	 charges	 with	 dollops	 of	 disgust,	 sarca sm,	 and
contempt;	 both	 give	 rise	 to	 defensiveness	 and	 dodgin g	 of
responsibility	 and,	 finally,	 to	 stonewalling	 or	 the 	 embittered	 passive
resistance	that	comes	from	feeling	unfairly	treated.	 Indeed,	one	of	the
more	 common	 forms	 of	 destructive	 criticism	 in	 the	 workpl ace,	 says
one	 business	 consultant,	 is	 a	 blanket,	 generalized	 statement	 like
“You’re	 screwing	 up,”	 delivered	 in	 a	 harsh,	 sarcast ic,	 angry	 tone,
providing	neither	a	chance	to	respond	nor	any	sugge stion	of	how	to
do	things	better.	It	leaves	the	person	receiving	it 	feeling	helpless	and
angry.	 From	 the	 vantage	 point	 of	 emotional	 intelligen ce,	 such
criticism	displays	an	ignorance	of	the	feelings	it	w ill	trigger	in	those
who	receive	it,	and	the	devastating	effect	those	fe elings	will	have	on
their	motivation,	energy,	and	confidence	in	doing	their	work .
This	destructive	dynamic	showed	up	in	a	survey	of	man agers	who
were	asked	to	think	back	to	times	they	blew	up	at	emp loyees	and,	in
======================================== [Página 175] ========================================

the	heat	of	the	moment,	made	a	personal	attack. 5	The	angry	attacks
had	effects	much	like	they	would	in	a	married	couple: 	the	employees
who	received	them	reacted	most	often	by	becoming	defen sive,	making
excuses,	or	evading	responsibility.	Or	they	stonewa lled—that	is,	tried
to	avoid	all	contact	with	the	manager	who	blew	up	at 	them.	If	they
had	 been	 subjected	 to	 the	 same	 emotional	 microscope	 th at	 John
Gottman	 used	 with	 married	 couples,	 these	 embittered	 emp loyees
would	 no	 doubt	 have	 been	 shown	 to	 be	 thinking	 the	 t houghts	 of
innocent	victimhood	or	righteous	indignation	typical 	of	husbands	or
wives	who	feel	unfairly	attacked.	If	their	physiolo gy	were	measured,
they	 would	 probably	 also	 display	 the	 flooding	 that	 reinforces	 such
thoughts.	 And	 yet	 the	 managers	 were	 only	 further	 ann oyed	 and
provoked	by	these	responses,	suggesting	the	beginni ng	of	a	cycle	that,
in	the	business	world,	ends	in	the	employee	quitting 	or	being	fired—
the	business	equivalent	of	a	divorce.
Indeed,	in	a	study	of	108	managers	and	white-collar	 workers,	inept
criticism	 was	 ahead	 of	 mistrust,	 personality	 struggle s,	 and	 disputes
over	 power	 and	 pay	 as	 a	 reason	 for	 conflict	 on	 the	 job. 6	 An
experiment	 done	 at	 Rensselaer	 Polytechnic	 Institute	 shows	 just	 how
damaging	 to	 working	 relationships	 a	 cutting	 criticis m	 can	 be.	 In	 a
simulation,	volunteers	were	given	the	task	of	creati ng	an	ad	for	a	new
shampoo.	 Another	 volunteer	 (a	 confederate)	 supposedl y	 judged	 the
proposed	 ads;	 volunteers	 actually	 received	 one	 of	 t wo	 prearranged
criticisms.	 One	 critique	 was	 considerate	 and	 specifi c.	 But	 the	 other
included	 threats	 and	 blamed	 the	 person’s	 innate	 defi ciencies,	 with
remarks	like,	“Didn’t	even	try;	can’t	seem	to	do	anyt hing	right”	and
“Maybe	it’s	just	lack	of	talent.	I’d	try	to	get	someone	else	to	d o	it.”
Understandably,	those	who	were	attacked	became	tense 	and	angry
and	antagonistic,	saying	they	would	refuse	to	colla borate	or	cooperate
on	 future	 projects	 with	 the	 person	 who	 gave	 the	 cri ticism.	 Many
indicated	 they	 would	 want	 to	 avoid	 contact	 altogeth er—in	 other
words,	 they	 felt	 like	 stonewalling.	 The	 harsh	 criti cism	 made	 those
who	received	it	so	demoralized	that	they	no	longer	t ried	as	hard	at
their	 work	 and,	 perhaps	 most	 damaging,	 said	 they	 no	 l onger	 felt
capable	 of	 doing	 well.	 The	 personal	 attack	 was	 deva stating	 to	 their
morale.
Many	managers	are	too	willing	to	criticize,	but	frug al	with	praise,
leaving	their	employees	feeling	that	they	only	hear	 about	how	they’re
doing	 when	 they	 make	 a	 mistake.	 This	 propensity	 to	 cr iticism	 is
compounded	 by	 managers	 who	 delay	 giving	 any	 feedback	 at	 all	 for
======================================== [Página 176] ========================================

long	 periods.	 “Most	 problems	 in	 an	 employee’s	 performa nce	 are	 not
sudden;	they	develop	slowly	over	time,”	J.	R.	Larson ,	a	University	of
Illinois	at	Urbana	psychologist,	notes.	“When	the	b oss	fails	to	let	his
feelings	 be	 known	 promptly,	 it	 leads	 to	 his	 frustrat ion	 building	 up
slowly.	Then,	one	day,	he	blows	up	about	it.	If	the 	criticism	had	been
given	 earlier	 on,	 the	 employee	 would	 have	 been	 able	 to	 correct	 the
problem.	Too	often	people	criticize	only	when	things 	boil	over,	when
they	get	too	angry	to	contain	themselves.	And	that’s 	when	they	give
the	criticism	in	the	worst	way,	in	a	tone	of	biting	 sarcasm,	calling	to
mind	a	long	list	of	grievances	they	had	kept	to	thems elves,	or	making
threats.	Such	attacks	backfire.	They	are	received	a s	an	affront,	so	the
recipient	 becomes	 angry	 in	 return.	 It’s	 the	 worst	 wa y	 to	 motivate
someone.”
The	Artful	Critique
Consider	the	alternative.
An	 artful	 critique	 can	 be	 one	 of	 the	 most	 helpful	 mes sages	 a
manager	 can	 send.	 For	 example,	 what	 the	 contemptuous	 v ice
president	 could	 have	 told	 the	 software	 engineer—but	 did	 not—was
something	like:	“The	main	difficulty	at	this	stage	is 	that	your	plan	will
take	too	long	and	so	escalate	costs.	I’d	like	you	t o	think	more	about
your	 proposal,	 especially	 the	 design	 specifications 	 for	 software
development,	to	see	if	you	can	figure	out	a	way	to	d o	the	same	job
more	quickly.”	Such	a	message	has	the	opposite	impact	 of	destructive
criticism:	 instead	 of	 creating	 helplessness,	 anger,	 and	 rebellion,	 it
holds	 out	 the	 hope	 of	 doing	 better	 and	 suggests	 the 	 beginning	 of	 a
plan	for	doing	so.
An	 artful	 critique	 focuses	 on	 what	 a	 person	 has	 don e	 and	 can	 do
rather	 than	 reading	 a	 mark	 of	 character	 into	 a	 job	 p oorly	 done.	 As
Larson	 observes,	 “A	 character	 attack—calling	 someone	 stupid	 or
incompetent—misses	 the	 point.	 You	 immediately	 put	 him	 on	 the
defensive,	 so	 that	 he’s	 no	 longer	 receptive	 to	 what 	 you	 have	 to	 tell
him	 about	 how	 to	 do	 things	 better.”	 That	 advice,	 of	 course,	 is
precisely	the	same	as	for	married	couples	airing	their	grievan ces.
And,	in	terms	of	motivation,	when	people	believe	that 	their	failures
are	 due	 to	 some	 unchangeable	 deficit	 in	 themselves,	 t hey	 lose	 hope
and	stop	trying.	The	basic	belief	that	leads	to	opt imism,	remember,	is
that	 setbacks	 or	 failures	 are	 due	 to	 circumstances	 t hat	 we	 can	 do
something	about	to	change	them	for	the	better.
======================================== [Página 177] ========================================

Harry	Levinson,	a	psychoanalyst	turned	corporate	con sultant,	gives
the	 following	 advice	 on	 the	 art	 of	 the	 critique,	 wh ich	 is	 intricately
entwined	with	the	art	of	praise:
•	Be	specific .	 Pick	 a	 significant	 incident,	 an	 event	 that	 illust rates	 a
key	problem	that	needs	changing	or	a	pattern	of	defi ciency,	such	as
the	inability	to	do	certain	parts	of	a	job	well.	It 	demoralizes	people
just	to	hear	that	they	are	doing	“something”	wrong	w ithout	knowing
what	 the	 specifics	 are	 so	 they	 can	 change.	 Focus	 on 	 the	 specifics,
saying	what	the	person	did	well,	what	was	done	poor ly,	and	how	it
could	 be	 changed.	 Don’t	 beat	 around	 the	 bush	 or	 be	 oblique	 or
evasive;	it	will	muddy	the	real	message.	This,	of	cou rse,	is	akin	to	the
advice	 to	 couples	 about	 the	 “XYZ”	 statement	 of	 a	 grie vance:	 say
exactly	 what	 the	 problem	 is,	 what’s	 wrong	 with	 it	 or 	 how	 it	 makes
you	feel,	and	what	could	be	changed.
“Specificity,”	Levinson	points	out,	“is	just	as	impo rtant	for	praise	as
for	criticism.	I	won’t	say	that	vague	praise	has	no	 effect	at	all,	but	it
doesn’t	have	much,	and	you	can’t	learn	from	it.” 7
•	Offer	a	solution .	The	critique,	like	all	useful	feedback,	should	po int
to	 a	 way	 to	 fix	 the	 problem.	 Otherwise	 it	 leaves	 the 	 recipient
frustrated,	 demoralized,	 or	 demotivated.	 The	 critique 	 may	 open	 the
door	 to	 possibilities	 and	 alternatives	 that	 the	 per son	 did	 not	 realize
were	there,	or	simply	sensitize	her	to	deficiencies	 that	need	attention
—but	 should	 include	 suggestions	 about	 how	 to	 take	 ca re	 of	 these
problems.
•	Be	present .	Critiques,	like	praise,	are	most	effective	face	t o	face	and
in	 private.	 People	 who	 are	 uncomfortable	 giving	 a	 cr iticism—or
offering	praise—are	likely	to	ease	the	burden	on	the mselves	by	doing
it	at	a	distance,	such	as	in	a	memo.	But	this	makes	th e	communication
too	impersonal,	and	robs	the	person	receiving	it	of	 an	opportunity	for
a	response	or	clarification.
•	Be	sensitive .	 This	 is	 a	 call	 for	 empathy,	 for	 being	 attuned	 to	 t he
impact	 of	 what	 you	 say	 and	 how	 you	 say	 it	 on	 the	 per son	 at	 the
receiving	 end.	 Managers	 who	 have	 little	 empathy,	 Lev inson	 points
out,	are	most	prone	to	giving	feedback	in	a	hurtful	 fashion,	such	as
the	withering	put-down.	The	net	effect	of	such	crit icism	is	destructive:
instead	 of	 opening	 the	 way	 for	 a	 corrective,	 it	 cre ates	 an	 emotional
backlash	of	resentment,	bitterness,	defensiveness,	and	dis tance.
Levinson	 also	 offers	 some	 emotional	 counsel	 for	 those 	 at	 the
======================================== [Página 178] ========================================

receiving	 end	 of	 criticism.	 One	 is	 to	 see	 the	 critic ism	 as	 valuable
information	about	how	to	do	better,	not	as	a	persona l	attack.	Another
is	 to	 watch	 for	 the	 impulse	 toward	 defensiveness	 ins tead	 of	 taking
responsibility.	And,	if	it	gets	too	upsetting,	ask	 to	resume	the	meeting
later,	after	a	period	to	absorb	the	difficult	messag e	and	cool	down	a
bit.	 Finally,	 he	 advises	 people	 to	 see	 criticism	 as	 an	 opportunity	 to
work	 together	 with	 the	 critic	 to	 solve	 the	 problem,	 not	 as	 an
adversarial	 situation.	 All	 this	 sage	 advice,	 of	 cou rse,	 directly	 echoes
suggestions	 for	 married	 couples	 trying	 to	 handle	 the ir	 complaints
without	 doing	 permanent	 damage	 to	 their	 relationship. 	 As	 with
marriage,	so	with	work.
DEALING	WITH	DIVERSITY
Sylvia	 Skeeter,	 a	 former	 army	 captain	 in	 her	 thirties ,	 was	 a	 shift
manager	 at	 a	 Denny’s	 restaurant	 in	 Columbia,	 South	 Ca rolina.	 One
slow	 afternoon	 a	 group	 of	 black	 customers—a	 minister,	 an	 assistant
pastor,	and	two	visiting	gospel	singers—came	in	for	a 	meal,	and	sat
and	 sat	 while	 the	 waitresses	 ignored	 them.	 The	 waitr esses,	 recalls
Skeeter,	“would	kind	of	glare,	with	their	hands	on	 their	hips,	and	then
they’d	 go	 back	 to	 talking	 among	 themselves,	 like	 a	 bl ack	 person
standing	five	feet	away	didn’t	exist.”
Skeeter,	 indignant,	 confronted	 the	 waitresses,	 and	 complained	 to
the	manager,	who	shrugged	off	their	actions,	saying, 	“That’s	how	they
were	raised,	and	there’s	nothing	I	can	do	about	it. ”	Skeeter	quit	on	the
spot;	she	is	black.
If	 that	 had	 been	 an	 isolated	 incident,	 this	 moment	 of 	 blatant
prejudice	might	have	passed	unnoted.	But	Sylvia	Skee ter	was	one	of
hundreds	 of	 people	 who	 came	 forward	 to	 testify	 to	 a	 widespread
pattern	 of	 antiblack	 prejudice	 throughout	 the	 Denny ’s	 restaurant
chain,	a	pattern	that	resulted	in	a	$54	million	sett lement	of	a	class-
action	 suit	 on	 behalf	 of	 thousands	 of	 black	 customer s	 who	 had
suffered	such	indignities.
The	 plaintiffs	 included	 a	 detail	 of	 seven	 African-A merican	 Secret
Service	agents	who	sat	waiting	for	an	hour	for	thei r	breakfast	while
their	 white	 colleagues	 at	 the	 next	 table	 were	 serve d	 promptly—as
they	were	all	on	their	way	to	provide	security	for	 a	visit	by	President
Clinton	to	the	United	States	Naval	Academy	at	Annapo lis.	They	also
included	a	black	girl	with	paralyzed	legs	in	Tampa,	Florida,	w ho	sat	in
======================================== [Página 179] ========================================

her	wheelchair	for	two	hours	waiting	for	her	food	l ate	one	night	after
a	prom.	The	pattern	of	discrimination,	the	class-acti on	suit	held,	was
due	 to	 the	 widespread	 assumption	 throughout	 the	 Denn y’s	 chain—
particularly	 at	 the	 level	 of	 district	 and	 branch	 man ager—that	 black
customers	were	bad	for	business.	Today,	largely	as	a 	result	of	the	suit
and	publicity	surrounding	it,	the	Denny’s	chain	is	 making	amends	to
the	black	community.	And	every	employee,	especially	man agers,	must
attend	sessions	on	the	advantages	of	a	multiracial	clientele .
Such	 seminars	 have	 become	 a	 staple	 of	 in-house	 traini ng	 in
companies	 throughout	 America,	 with	 the	 growing	 realiz ation	 by
managers	that	even	if	people	bring	prejudices	to	work	with	the m,	they
must	 learn	 to	 act	 as	 though	 they	 have	 none.	 The	 reas ons,	 over	 and
above	human	decency,	are	pragmatic.	One	is	the	shifti ng	face	of	the
workforce,	as	white	males,	who	used	to	be	the	dominan t	group,	are
becoming	 a	 minority.	 A	 survey	 of	 several	 hundred	 Ameri can
companies	 found	 that	 more	 than	 three	 quarters	 of	 new	 employees
were	nonwhite—a	demographic	shift	that	is	also	reflec ted	to	a	large
extent	 in	 the	 changing	 pool	 of	 customers. 8	 Another	 reason	 is	 the
increasing	 need	 for	 international	 companies	 to	 have	 employees	 who
not	only	put	any	bias	aside	to	appreciate	people	fr om	diverse	cultures
(and	 markets)	 but	 also	 turn	 that	 appreciation	 to	 comp etitive
advantage.	 A	 third	 motivation	 is	 the	 potential	 fruit 	 of	 diversity,	 in
terms	of	heightened	collective	creativity	and	entrepreneur ial	energy.
All	this	means	the	culture	of	an	organization	must	ch ange	to	foster
tolerance,	even	if	individual	biases	remain.	But	how 	can	a	company
do	 this?	 The	 sad	 fact	 is	 that	 the	 panoply	 of	 one-da y,	 one-video,	 or
single-weekend	 “diversity	 training”	 courses	 do	 not	 really	 seem	 to
budge	 the	 biases	 of	 those	 employees	 who	 come	 to	 them	 w ith	 deep
prejudice	against	one	or	another	group,	whether	it	 be	whites	biased
against	 blacks,	 blacks	 against	 Asians,	 or	 Asians	 re senting	 Hispanics.
Indeed,	the	net	effect	of	inept	diversity	courses—th ose	that	raise	false
expectations	by	promising	too	much,	or	simply	create	a n	atmosphere
of	 confrontation	 instead	 of	 understanding—can	 be	 to	 heighten	 the
tensions	 that	 divide	 groups	 in	 the	 workplace,	 calli ng	 even	 greater
attention	 to	 these	 differences.	 To	 understand	 what	 can	 be	 done,	 it
helps	to	first	understand	the	nature	of	prejudice	itself.
The	Roots	of	Prejudice
Dr.	Vamik	Volkan	is	a	psychiatrist	at	the	University 	of	Virginia	now,
======================================== [Página 180] ========================================

but	he	remembers	what	it	was	like	growing	up	in	a	Tur kish	family	on
the	 island	 of	 Cyprus,	 then	 bitterly	 contested	 betwe en	 Turks	 and
Greeks.	 As	 a	 boy	 Volkan	 heard	 rumors	 that	 the	 local	 Greek	 priest’s
cincture	 had	 a	 knot	 for	 each	 Turkish	 child	 he	 had	 s trangled,	 and
remembers	 the	 tone	 of	 dismay	 in	 which	 he	 was	 told	 how	 his	 Greek
neighbors	ate	pigs,	whose	meat	was	considered	too	fi lthy	to	eat	in	his
own	 Turkish	 culture.	 Now,	 as	 a	 student	 of	 ethnic	 co nflict,	 Volkan
points	 to	 such	 childhood	 memories	 to	 show	 how	 hatreds 	 between
groups	 are	 kept	 alive	 over	 the	 years,	 as	 each	 new	 g eneration	 is
steeped	in	hostile	biases	like	these. 9	The	psychological	price	of	loyalty
to	one’s	own	group	can	be	antipathy	toward	another, 	especially	when
there	is	a	long	history	of	enmity	between	the	groups.
Prejudices	are	a	kind	of	emotional	learning	that	occ urs	early	in	life,
making	these	reactions	especially	hard	to	eradicate	 entirely,	even	in
people	who	as	adults	feel	it	is	wrong	to	hold	them.	 “The	emotions	of
prejudice	are	formed	in	childhood,	while	the	beliefs 	that	are	used	to
justify	 it	 come	 later,”	 explained	 Thomas	 Pettigrew,	 a 	 social
psychologist	 at	 the	 University	 of	 California	 at	 San ta	 Cruz,	 who	 has
studied	prejudice	for	decades.	“Later	in	life	you	ma y	want	to	change
your	prejudice,	but	it	is	far	easier	to	change	your 	intellectual	beliefs
than	your	deep	feelings.	Many	Southerners	have	conf essed	to	me,	for
instance,	that	even	though	in	their	minds	they	no	longer	feel	p rejudice
against	 blacks,	 they	 feel	 squeamish	 when	 they	 shake	 hands	 with	 a
black.	 The	 feelings	 are	 left	 over	 from	 what	 they	 lea rned	 in	 their
families	as	children.” 10
The	power	of	the	stereotypes	that	buttress	prejudic e	comes	in	part
from	a	more	neutral	dynamic	in	the	mind	that	makes	stere otypes	of
all	 kinds	 self-confirming. 11	 People	 remember	 more	 readily	 instances
that	 support	 the	 stereotype	 while	 tending	 to	 discou nt	 instances	 that
challenge	 it.	 On	 meeting	 at	 a	 party	 an	 emotionally	 op en	 and	 warm
Englishman	 who	 disconfirms	 the	 stereotype	 of	 the	 cold ,	 reserved
Briton,	for	example,	people	can	tell	themselves	that	 he’s	just	unusual,
or	“he’s	been	drinking.”
The	tenacity	of	subtle	biases	may	explain	why,	while 	over	the	last
forty	 years	 or	 so	 racial	 attitudes	 of	 American	 white s	 toward	 blacks
have	 become	 increasingly	 more	 tolerant,	 more	 subtle	 fo rms	 of	 bias
persist:	people	disavow	racist	attitudes	while	stil l	acting	with	covert
bias. 12	 When	 asked,	 such	 people	 say	 they	 feel	 no	 bigotry,	 but	 in
ambiguous	 situations	 still	 act	 in	 a	 biased	 way—though 	 they	 give	 a
rationale	other	than	prejudice.	Such	bias	can	take	 the	form,	say,	of	a
======================================== [Página 181] ========================================

white	senior	manager—who	believes	he	has	no	prejudice s—rejecting
a	black	job	applicant,	ostensibly	not	because	of	hi s	race	but	because
his	education	and	experience	“are	not	quite	right”	 for	the	job,	while
hiring	a	white	applicant	with	about	the	same	backgro und.	Or	it	might
take	the	form	of	giving	a	briefing	and	helpful	tips	 to	a	white	salesman
about	to	make	a	call,	but	somehow	neglecting	to	do	th e	same	for	a
black	or	Hispanic	salesman.
Zero	Tolerance	for	Intolerance
If	people’s	long-held	biases	cannot	be	so	easily	we eded	out,	what	can
be	 changed	 is	 what	 they	 do	 about	 them.	 At	 Denny’s,	 for	 example,
waitresses	 or	 branch	 managers	 who	 took	 it	 upon	 themse lves	 to
discriminate	against	blacks	were	seldom,	if	ever,	cha llenged.	Instead,
some	 managers	 seem	 to	 have	 encouraged	 them,	 at	 least	 ta citly,	 to
discriminate,	even	suggesting	policies	such	as	demand ing	payment	for
meals	in	advance	from	black	customers	only,	denying	bl acks	widely
advertised	free	birthday	meals,	or	locking	the	doors 	and	claiming	to
be	 closed	 if	 a	 group	 of	 black	 customers	 was	 coming.	 A s	 John	 P.
Relman,	an	attorney	who	sued	Denny’s	on	behalf	of	th e	black	Secret
Service	agents,	put	it,	“Denny’s	management	closed	th eir	eyes	to	what
the	 field	 staff	 was	 doing.	 There	 must	 have	 been	 some
message	…	which	freed	up	the	inhibitions	of	local	mana gers	to	act	on
their	racist	impulses.” 13
But	 everything	 we	 know	 about	 the	 roots	 of	 prejudice 	 and	 how	 to
fight	 it	 effectively	 suggests	 that	 precisely	 this	 a ttitude—turning	 a
blind	 eye	 to	 acts	 of	 bias—allows	 discrimination	 to	 t hrive.	 To	 do
nothing,	in	this	context,	is	an	act	of	consequence	 in	itself,	letting	the
virus	of	prejudice	spread	unopposed.	More	to	the	po int	than	diversity
training	courses—or	perhaps	essential	to	their	havin g	much	effect—is
that	the	norms	of	a	group	be	decisively	changed	by	t aking	an	active
stance	 against	 any	 acts	 of	 discrimination,	 from	 the	 t op	 echelons	 of
management	 on	 down.	 Biases	 may	 not	 budge,	 but	 acts	 of	 prejudice
can	be	quashed,	if	the	climate	is	changed.	As	an	IBM 	executive	put	it,
“We	 don’t	 tolerate	 slights	 or	 insults	 in	 any	 way;	 r espect	 for	 the
individual	is	central	to	IBM’s	culture.” 14
If	 research	 on	 prejudice	 has	 any	 lesson	 for	 making	 a 	 corporate
culture	more	tolerant,	it	is	to	encourage	people	to	 speak	out	against
even	 low-key	 acts	 of	 discrimination	 or	 harassment—offe nsive	 jokes,
say,	 or	 the	 posting	 of	 girlie	 calendars	 demeaning	 to 	 women
======================================== [Página 182] ========================================

coworkers.	 One	 study	 found	 that	 when	 people	 in	 a	 gr oup	 heard
someone	make	ethnic	slurs,	it	led	others	to	do	the	sa me.	The	simple
act	of	naming	bias	as	such	or	objecting	to	it	on	the 	spot	establishes	a
social	 atmosphere	 that	 discourages	 it;	 saying	 nothin g	 serves	 to
condone	it. 15	In	this	endeavor,	those	in	positions	of	authority	 play	a
pivotal	 role:	 their	 failure	 to	 condemn	 acts	 of	 bias	 sends	 the	 tacit
message	that	such	acts	are	okay.	Following	through	w ith	action	such
as	a	reprimand	sends	a	powerful	message	that	bias	is	 not	trivial,	but
has	real—and	negative—consequences.
Here	 too	 the	 skills	 of	 emotional	 intelligence	 are	 an	 advantage,
especially	in	having	the	social	knack	to	know	not	j ust	when	but	how
to	 speak	 up	 productively	 against	 bias.	 Such	 feedbac k	 should	 be
couched	 with	 all	 the	 finesse	 of	 an	 effective	 critic ism,	 so	 it	 can	 be
heard	 without	 defensiveness.	 If	 managers	 and	 coworke rs	 do	 this
naturally,	or	learn	to	do	so,	bias	incidents	are	more	likely	to 	fall	away.
The	 more	 effective	 diversity	 training	 courses	 set	 a	 new,
organizationwide,	 explicit	 ground	 rule	 that	 makes	 bi as	 in	 any	 form
out-of-bounds,	 and	 so	 encourages	 people	 who	 have	 be en	 silent
witnesses	 and	 bystanders	 to	 voice	 their	 discomforts	 and	 objections.
Another	active	ingredient	in	diversity	courses	is	p erspective-taking,	a
stance	 that	 encourages	 empathy	 and	 tolerance.	 To	 the 	 degree	 that
people	come	to	understand	the	pain	of	those	who	feel 	discriminated
against,	they	are	more	likely	to	speak	out	against	it.
In	short,	it	is	more	practical	to	try	to	suppress	th e	expression	of	bias
rather	than	trying	to	eliminate	the	attitude	itself; 	stereotypes	change
very	 slowly,	 if	 at	 all.	 Simply	 putting	 people	 of	 dif ferent	 groups
together	does	little	or	nothing	to	lower	intoleranc e,	as	witness	cases	of
school	 desegregation	 in	 which	 intergroup	 hostility	 rose	 rather	 than
decreased.	 For	 the	 plethora	 of	 diversity	 training	 p rograms	 that	 are
sweeping	through	the	corporate	world,	this	means	a	r ealistic	goal	is	to
change	the	norms 	of	a	group	for	showing	prejudice	or	harassing;	suc h
programs	can	do	much	to	raise	into	the	collective	awa reness	the	idea
that	 bigotry	 or	 harassment	 are	 not	 acceptable	 and	 wi ll	 not	 be
tolerated.	But	to	expect	that	such	a	program	will	up root	deeply	held
prejudices	is	unrealistic.
Still,	since	prejudices	are	a	variety	of	emotional	l earning,	relearning
is	 possible—though	 it	 takes	 time	 and	 should	 not	 be	 expe cted	 as	 the
outcome	of	a	one-time	diversity	training	workshop.	Wh at	can	make	a
difference,	though,	is	sustained	camaraderie	and	daily	effo rts	toward	a
common	goal	by	people	of	different	backgrounds.	The	l esson	here	is
======================================== [Página 183] ========================================

from	school	desegregation:	when	groups	fail	to	mix	so cially,	instead
forming	hostile	cliques,	the	negative	stereotypes	in tensify.	But	when
students	have	worked	together	as	equals	to	attain	a 	common	goal,	as
on	 sports	 teams	 or	 in	 bands,	 their	 stereotypes	 break 	 down—as	 can
happen	 naturally	 in	 the	 workplace,	 when	 people	 work 	 together	 as
peers	over	the	years. 16
But	 to	 stop	 at	 battling	 prejudice	 in	 the	 workplace	 is	 to	 miss	 a
greater	 opportunity:	 taking	 advantage	 of	 the	 creati ve	 and
entrepreneurial	possibilities	that	a	diverse	workfo rce	can	offer.	As	we
shall	see,	a	working	group	of	varied	strengths	and	 perspectives,	if	it
can	operate	in	harmony,	is	likely	to	come	to	better,	more	creativ e,	and
more	effective	solutions	than	those	same	people	working	in	iso lation.
ORGANIZATIONAL	SAVVY	AND	THE	GROUP	IQ
By	the	end	of	the	century,	a	third	of	the	American	w orkforce	will	be
“knowledge	workers,”	people	whose	productivity	is	ma rked	by	adding
value	 to	 information—whether	 as	 market	 analysts,	 write rs,	 or
computer	 programmers.	 Peter	 Drucker,	 the	 eminent	 busine ss	 maven
who	 coined	 the	 term	 “knowledge	 worker,”	 points	 out	 t hat	 such
workers’	 expertise	 is	 highly	 specialized,	 and	 that	 their	 productivity
depends	on	their	efforts	being	coordinated	as	part	of	an	orga nizational
team:	 writers	 are	 not	 publishers;	 computer	 programmers	 are	 not
software	 distributors.	 While	 people	 have	 always	 wor ked	 in	 tandem,
notes	 Drucker,	 with	 knowledge	 work,	 “teams	 become	 the 	 work	 unit
rather	 than	 the	 individual	 himself.” 17	 And	 that	 suggests	 why
emotional	intelligence,	the	skills	that	help	people	 harmonize,	should
become	increasingly	valued	as	a	workplace	asset	in	the	years	t o	come.
Perhaps	the	most	rudimentary	form	of	organizational	te amwork	is
the	 meeting,	 that	 inescapable	 part	 of	 an	 executive’s 	 lot—in	 a
boardroom,	 on	 a	 conference	 call,	 in	 someone’s	 office. 	 Meetings—
bodies	in	the	same	room—are	but	the	most	obvious,	and	a 	somewhat
antiquated,	example	of	the	sense	in	which	work	is	sh ared.	Electronic
networks,	 e-mail,	 teleconferences,	 work	 teams,	 informa l	 networks,
and	the	like	are	emerging	as	new	functional	entities 	in	organizations.
To	 the	 degree	 that	 the	 explicit	 hierarchy	 as	 mapped	 on	 an
organizational	chart	is	the	skeleton	of	an	organiza tion,	these	human
touchpoints	are	its	central	nervous	system.
Whenever	people	come	together	to	collaborate,	whethe r	it	be	in	an
======================================== [Página 184] ========================================

executive	 planning	 meeting	 or	 as	 a	 team	 working	 towar d	 a	 shared
product,	there	is	a	very	real	sense	in	which	they	h ave	a	group	IQ,	the
sum	total	of	the	talents	and	skills	of	all	those	inv olved.	And	how	well
they	accomplish	their	task	will	be	determined	by	how	 high	that	IQ	is.
The	single	most	important	element	in	group	intelligenc e,	it	turns	out,
is	 not	 the	 average	 IQ	 in	 the	 academic	 sense,	 but	 rat her	 in	 terms	 of
emotional	intelligence.	The	key	to	a	high	group	IQ	i s	social	harmony.
It	is	this	ability	to	harmonize	that,	all	other	thin gs	being	equal,	will
make	 one	 group	 especially	 talented,	 productive,	 and	 successful,	 and
another—with	 members	 whose	 talent	 and	 skill	 are	 equal	 in	 other
regards—do	poorly.
The	idea	that	there	is	a	group	intelligence	at	all	 comes	from	Robert
Sternberg,	 the	 Yale	 psychologist,	 and	 Wendy	 Williams ,	 a	 graduate
student,	 who	 were	 seeking	 to	 understand	 why	 some	 gro ups	 are	 far
more	effective	than	others. 18	After	all,	when	people	come	together	to
work	 as	 a	 group,	 each	 brings	 certain	 talents—say,	 a	 high	 verbal
fluency,	creativity,	empathy,	or	technical	expertise .	While	a	group	can
be	no	“smarter”	than	the	sum	total	of	all	these	speci fic	strengths,	it
can	 be	 much	 dumber	 if	 its	 internal	 workings	 don’t	 all ow	 people	 to
share	their	talents.	This	maxim	became	evident	when	St ernberg	and
Williams	recruited	people	to	take	part	in	groups	tha t	were	given	the
creative	 challenge	 of	 coming	 up	 with	 an	 effective	 ad vertising
campaign	 for	 a	 fictitious	 sweetener	 that	 showed	 promi se	 as	 a	 sugar
substitute.
One	surprise	was	that	people	who	were	 too	eager	to	take	part	were
a	 drag	 on	 the	 group,	 lowering	 its	 overall	 performanc e;	 these	 eager
beavers	were	too	controlling	or	domineering.	Such	pe ople	seemed	to
lack	 a	 basic	 element	 of	 social	 intelligence,	 the	 abi lity	 to	 recognize
what	is	apt	and	what	inappropriate	in	give-and-take .	Another	negative
was	having	deadweight,	members	who	did	not	participate.
The	single	most	important	factor	in	maximizing	the	exce llence	of	a
group’s	product	was	the	degree	to	which	the	members	w ere	able	to
create	a	state	of	internal	harmony,	which	lets	them	t ake	advantage	of
the	 full	 talent	 of	 their	 members.	 The	 overall	 performa nce	 of
harmonious	 groups	 was	 helped	 by	 having	 a	 member	 who	 wa s
particularly	talented;	groups	with	more	friction	wer e	far	less	able	to
capitalize	on	having	members	of	great	ability.	In	gro ups	where	there
are	high	levels	of	emotional	and	social	static—whethe r	it	be	from	fear
or	 anger,	 from	 rivalries	 or	 resentments—people	 cannot	 offer	 their
best.	But	harmony	allows	a	group	to	take	maximum	advant age	of	its
======================================== [Página 185] ========================================

most	creative	and	talented	members’	abilities.
While	the	moral	of	this	tale	is	quite	clear	for,	say ,	work	teams,	it
has	 a	 more	 general	 implication	 for	 anyone	 who	 works	 w ithin	 an
organization.	Many	things	people	do	at	work	depend	 on	their	ability
to	call	on	a	loose	network	of	fellow	workers;	diffe rent	tasks	can	mean
calling	on	different	members	of	the	network.	In	effec t,	this	creates	the
chance	for	ad	hoc	groups,	each	with	a	membership	tail ored	to	offer	an
optimal	 array	 of	 talents,	 expertise,	 and	 placement.	 J ust	 how	 well
people	can	“work”	a	network—in	effect,	make	it	into	a 	temporary,	ad
hoc	team—is	a	crucial	factor	in	on-the-job	success.
Consider,	for	example,	a	study	of	star	performers	at	 Bell	Labs,	the
world-famous	 scientific	 think	 tank	 near	 Princeton.	 T he	 labs	 are
peopled	by	engineers	and	scientists	who	are	all	at	the	top	on	a cademic
IQ	 tests.	 But	 within	 this	 pool	 of	 talent,	 some	 emerge 	 as	 stars,	 while
others	 are	 only	 average	 in	 their	 output.	 What	 makes	 the	 difference
between	 stars	 and	 the	 others	 is	 not	 their	 academic	 I Q,	 but	 their
emotional 	IQ.	They	are	better	able	to	motivate	themselves,	and 	better
able	to	work	their	informal	networks	into	ad	hoc	teams.
The	 “stars”	 were	 studied	 in	 one	 division	 at	 the	 lab s,	 a	 unit	 that
creates	 and	 designs	 the	 electronic	 switches	 that	 co ntrol	 telephone
systems—a	 highly	 sophisticated	 and	 demanding	 piece	 of	 electronic
engineering. 19	 Because	 the	 work	 is	 beyond	 the	 capacity	 of	 any	 one
person	to	tackle,	it	is	done	in	teams	that	can	range 	from	just	5	or	so
engineers	 to	 150.	 No	 single	 engineer	 knows	 enough	 t o	 do	 the	 job
alone;	getting	things	done	demands	tapping	other	peo ple’s	expertise.
To	find	out	what	made	the	difference	between	those	w ho	were	highly
productive	and	those	who	were	only	average,	Robert	 Kelley	and	Janet
Caplan	 had	 managers	 and	 peers	 nominate	 the	 10	 to	 15	 p ercent	 of
engineers	who	stood	out	as	stars.
When	 they	 compared	 the	 stars	 with	 everyone	 else,	 the 	 most
dramatic	finding,	at	first,	was	the	paucity	of	diffe rences	between	the
two	groups.	“Based	on	a	wide	range	of	cognitive	and 	social	measures,
from	 standard	 tests	 for	 IQ	 to	 personality	 inventorie s,	 there’s	 little
meaningful	difference	in	innate	abilities,”	Kelley	a nd	Caplan	wrote	in
the	Harvard	Business	Review .	“As	it	develops,	academic	talent	was	not
a	good	predictor	of	on-the-job	productivity,”	nor	was	IQ.
But	after	detailed	interviews,	the	critical	differe nces	emerged	in	the
internal	 and	 interpersonal	 strategies	 “stars”	 used	 to	 get	 their	 work
done.	 One	 of	 the	 most	 important	 turned	 out	 to	 be	 a	 ra pport	 with	 a
network	 of	 key	 people.	 Things	 go	 more	 smoothly	 for	 th e	 standouts
======================================== [Página 186] ========================================

because	they	put	time	into	cultivating	good	relation ships	with	people
whose	services	might	be	needed	in	a	crunch	as	part	o f	an	instant	ad
hoc	team	to	solve	a	problem	or	handle	a	crisis.	“A	mid dle	performer
at	 Bell	 Labs	 talked	 about	 being	 stumped	 by	 a	 technic al	 problem,”
Kelley	 and	 Caplan	 observed.	 “He	 painstakingly	 called 	 various
technical	 gurus	 and	 then	 waited,	 wasting	 valuable	 t ime	 while	 calls
went	 unreturned	 and	 e-mail	 messages	 unanswered.	 Star	 performers,
however,	 rarely	 face	 such	 situations	 because	 they	 d o	 the	 work	 of
building	reliable	networks	before	they	actually	nee d	them.	When	they
call	someone	for	advice,	stars	almost	always	get	a	faster	answe r.”
Informal	networks	are	especially	critical	for	handli ng	unanticipated
problems.	 “The	 formal	 organization	 is	 set	 up	 to	 handl e	 easily
anticipated	 problems,”	 one	 study	 of	 these	 networks	 o bserves.	 “But
when	unexpected	problems	arise,	the	informal	organiza tion	kicks	in.
Its	 complex	 web	 of	 social	 ties	 form	 every	 time	 colleag ues
communicate,	and	solidify	over	time	into	surprisingly	stable	n etworks.
Highly	adaptive,	informal	networks	move	diagonally	and 	elliptically,
skipping	entire	functions	to	get	things	done.” 20
The	 analysis	 of	 informal	 networks	 shows	 that	 just	 be cause	 people
work	 together	 day	 to	 day	 they	 will	 not	 necessarily	 trust	 each	 other
with	 sensitive	 information	 (such	 as	 a	 desire	 to	 chan ge	 jobs,	 or
resentment	about	how	a	manager	or	peer	behaves),	nor	 turn	to	them
in	 crisis.	 Indeed,	 a	 more	 sophisticated	 view	 of	 info rmal	 networks
shows	that	there	are	at	least	three	varieties:	commun ications	webs—
who	 talks	 to	 whom;	 expertise	 networks,	 based	 on	 whic h	 people	 are
turned	 to	 for	 advice;	 and	 trust	 networks.	 Being	 a	 ma in	 node	 in	 the
expertise	network	means	someone	will	have	a	reputatio n	for	technical
excellence,	which	often	leads	to	a	promotion.	But	th ere	is	virtually	no
relationship	 between	 being	 an	 expert	 and	 being	 seen 	 as	 someone
people	can	trust	with	their	secrets,	doubts,	and	vu lnerabilities.	A	petty
office	tyrant	or	micromanager	may	be	high	on	expertise ,	but	will	be
so	 low	 on	 trust	 that	 it	 will	 undermine	 their	 ability 	 to	 manage,	 and
effectively	 exclude	 them	 from	 informal	 networks.	 The	 s tars	 of	 an
organization	 are	 often	 those	 who	 have	 thick	 connect ions	 on	 all
networks,	whether	communications,	expertise,	or	trust.
Beyond	 a	 mastery	 of	 these	 essential	 networks,	 other	 forms	 of
organizational	 savvy	 the	 Bell	 Labs	 stars	 had	 mastere d	 included
effectively	 coordinating	 their	 efforts	 in	 teamwork;	 being	 leaders	 in
building	consensus;	being	able	to	see	things	from	th e	perspective	of
others,	such	as	customers	or	others	on	a	work	team;	p ersuasiveness;
======================================== [Página 187] ========================================

and	promoting	cooperation	while	avoiding	conflicts.	 While	all	of	these
rely	 on	 social	 skills,	 the	 stars	 also	 displayed	 ano ther	 kind	 of	 knack:
taking	 initiative—being	 self-motivated	 enough	 to	 take 	 on
responsibilities	 above	 and	 beyond	 their	 stated	 job—a nd	 self-
management	 in	 the	 sense	 of	 regulating	 their	 time	 and	 w ork
commitments	well.	All	such	skills,	of	course,	are	aspe cts	of	emotional
intelligence.
There	are	strong	signs	that	what	is	true	at	Bell	La bs	augurs	for	the
future	 of	 all	 corporate	 life,	 a	 tomorrow	 where	 the	 b asic	 skills	 of
emotional	intelligence	will	be	ever	more	important,	in 	teamwork,	in
cooperation,	 in	 helping	 people	 learn	 together	 how	 t o	 work	 more
effectively.	 As	 knowledge-based	 services	 and	 intell ectual	 capital
become	more	central	to	corporations,	improving	the	way 	people	work
together	will	be	a	major	way	to	leverage	intellectua l	capital,	making	a
critical	competitive	difference.	To	thrive,	if	not	s urvive,	corporations
would	do	well	to	boost	their	collective	emotional	intelligen ce.

Mind	and	Medicine
“Who	taught	you	all	this,	Doctor?”
The	reply	came	promptly:
“Suffering.”
—ALBERT 	CAMUS ,	The	Plague
A	 vague	 ache	 in	 my	 groin	 sent	 me	 to	 my	 doctor.	 Nothing 	 seemed
unusual	until	he	looked	at	the	results	of	a	urine	t est.	I	had	traces	of
blood	in	my	urine.
“I	 want	 you	 to	 go	 to	 the	 hospital	 and	 get	 some	 tests 	 …	 kidney
function,	cytology	…,”	he	said	in	a	businesslike	tone.
I	don’t	know	what	he	said	next.	My	mind	seemed	to	fre eze	at	the
word	cytology .	Cancer.
I	have	a	foggy	memory	of	his	explaining	to	me	when	and 	where	to
go	for	diagnostic	tests.	It	was	the	simplest	instruc tion,	but	I	had	to	ask
him	 to	 repeat	 it	 three	 or	 four	 times.	 Cytology —my	 mind	 would	 not
leave	the	word.	That	one	word	made	me	feel	as	though	I	had	just	bee n
mugged	at	my	own	front	door.
Why	should	I	have	reacted	so	strongly?	My	doctor	wa s	just	being
thorough	and	competent,	checking	the	limbs	in	a	diagn ostic	decision
tree.	There	was	a	tiny	likelihood	that	cancer	was	t he	problem.	But	this
rational	 analysis	 was	 irrelevant	 at	 that	 moment.	 In	 t he	 land	 of	 the
sick,	emotions	reign	supreme;	fear	is	a	thought	away .	We	can	be	so
emotionally	fragile	while	we	are	ailing	because	our	 mental	well-being
is	based	in	part	on	the	illusion	of	invulnerability .	Sickness—especially
a	 severe	 illness—bursts	 that	 illusion,	 attacking	 the 	 premise	 that	 our
private	world	is	safe	and	secure.	Suddenly	we	feel	 weak,	helpless,	and
vulnerable.
The	 problem	 is	 when	 medical	 personnel	 ignore	 how	 pati ents	 are
reacting	emotionally ,	even	while	attending	to	their	physical	condition.
This	inattention	to	the	emotional	reality	of	illness 	neglects	a	growing
body	 of	 evidence	 showing	 that	 people’s	 emotional	 sta tes	 can	 play	 a
sometimes	significant	role	in	their	vulnerability	to	 disease	and	in	the
======================================== [Página 189] ========================================

course	 of	 their	 recovery.	 Modern	 medical	 care	 too	 of ten	 lacks
emotional	intelligence.
For	the	patient,	any	encounter	with	a	nurse	or	phys ician	can	be	a
chance	for	reassuring	information,	comfort,	and	solac e—or,	if	handled
unfortunately,	 an	 invitation	 to	 despair.	 But	 too	 of ten	 medical
caregivers	 are	 rushed	 or	 indifferent	 to	 patients’	 d istress.	 To	 be	 sure,
there	are	compassionate	nurses	and	physicians	who	ta ke	the	time	to
reassure	and	inform	as	well	as	administer	medically.	B ut	the	trend	is
toward	a	professional	universe	in	which	institution al	imperatives	can
leave	 medical	 staff	 oblivious	 to	 the	 vulnerabilities 	 of	 patients,	 or
feeling	too	pressed	to	do	anything	about	them.	With	 the	hard	realities
of	a	medical	system	increasingly	timed	by	accountants, 	things	seem	to
be	getting	worse.
Beyond	 the	 humanitarian	 argument	 for	 physicians	 to	 of fer	 care
along	 with	 cure,	 there	 are	 other	 compelling	 reasons	 to	 consider	 the
psychological	 and	 social	 reality	 of	 patients	 as	 bei ng	 within	 the
medical	realm	rather	than	separate	from	it.	By	now	a	s cientific	case
can	be	made	that	there	is	a	margin	of	 medical 	effectiveness,	both	in
prevention	 and	 treatment,	 that	 can	 be	 gained	 by	 trea ting	 people’s
emotional	state	along	with	their	medical	condition.	N ot	in	every	case
or	every	condition,	of	course.	But	looking	at	data	 from	hundreds	and
hundreds	of	cases,	there	is	on	average	enough	incre ment	of	medical
benefit	to	suggest	that	an	 emotional 	intervention	should	be	a	standard
part	of	medical	care	for	the	range	of	serious	disease.
Historically,	medicine	in	modern	society	has	defined	 its	mission	in
terms	 of	 curing	 disease —the	 medical	 disorder—while	 overlooking
illness —the	 patient’s	 experience	 of	 disease.	 Patients,	 by	 g oing	 along
with	this	view	of	their	problem,	join	a	quiet	conspi racy	to	ignore	how
they	 are	 reacting	 emotionally	 to	 their	 medical	 proble ms—or	 to
dismiss	 those	 reactions	 as	 irrelevant	 to	 the	 course	 of	 the	 problem
itself.	 That	 attitude	 is	 reinforced	 by	 a	 medical	 mode l	 that	 dismisses
entirely	the	idea	that	mind	influences	body	in	any	consequent ial	way.
Yet	there	is	an	equally	unproductive	ideology	in	th e	other	direction:
the	 notion	 that	 people	 can	 cure	 themselves	 of	 even	 t he	 most
pernicious	 disease	 simply	 by	 making	 themselves	 happy	 o r	 thinking
positive	 thoughts,	 or	 that	 they	 are	 somehow	 to	 blame	 for	 having
gotten	 sick	 in	 the	 first	 place.	 The	 result	 of	 this	 attitude-will-cure-all
rhetoric	 has	 been	 to	 create	 widespread	 confusion	 an d
misunderstanding	about	the	extent	to	which	illness	c an	be	affected	by
the	mind,	and,	perhaps	worse,	sometimes	to	make	people	 feel	guilty
======================================== [Página 190] ========================================

for	having	a	disease,	as	though	it	were	a	sign	of	s ome	moral	lapse	or
spiritual	unworthiness.
The	 truth	 lies	 somewhere	 between	 these	 extremes.	 By	 s orting
through	the	scientific	data,	my	aim	is	to	clarify	the 	contradictions	and
replace	 the	 nonsense	 with	 a	 clearer	 understanding	 o f	 the	 degree	 to
which	 our	 emotions—and	 emotional	 intelligence—play	 a	 pa rt	 in
health	and	disease.
THE	BODY’S	MIND:	HOW	EMOTIONS	MATTER	FOR	HEALTH
In	 1974	 a	 finding	 in	 a	 laboratory	 at	 the	 School	 of	 Medicine	 and
Dentistry,	University	of	Rochester,	rewrote	biology ’s	map	of	the	body:
Robert	Ader,	a	psychologist,	discovered	that	the	immu ne	system,	like
the	brain,	could	learn.	His	result	was	a	shock;	the	 prevailing	wisdom
in	medicine	had	been	that	only	the	brain	and	central 	nervous	system
could	 respond	 to	 experience	 by	 changing	 how	 they	 be haved.	 Ader’s
finding	led	to	the	investigation	of	what	are	turnin g	out	to	be	myriad
ways	 the	 central	 nervous	 system	 and	 the	 immune	 system
communicate—biological	 pathways	 that	 make	 the	 mind,	 the
emotions,	and	the	body	not	separate,	but	intimately	entwined.
In	 his	 experiment	 white	 rats	 had	 been	 given	 a	 medicat ion	 that
artificially	 suppressed	 the	 quantity	 of	 disease-fig hting	 T	 cells
circulating	 in	 their	 blood.	 Each	 time	 they	 received	 the	 medication,
they	ate	it	along	with	saccharin-laced	water.	But	A der	discovered	that
giving	 the	 rats	 the	 saccharin-flavored	 water	 alone, 	 without	 the
suppressive	medication,	still	resulted	in	a	lowering 	of	the	T-cell	count
—to	the	point	that	some	of	the	rats	were	getting	sick 	and	dying.	Their
immune	 system	 had	 learned	 to	 suppress	 T	 cells	 in	 respo nse	 to	 the
flavored	water.	That	just	should	not	have	happened, 	according	to	the
best	scientific	understanding	at	the	time.
The	 immune	 system	 is	 the	 “body’s	 brain,”	 as	 neuroscien tist
Francisco	Varela,	at	Paris’s	Ecole	Polytechnique,	p uts	it,	defining	the
body’s	 own	 sense	 of	 self—of	 what	 belongs	 within	 it	 a nd	 what	 does
not. 1	 Immune	 cells	 travel	 in	 the	 bloodstream	 throughout	 the 	 entire
body,	contacting	virtually	every	other	cell.	Those	 cells	they	recognize,
they	leave	alone;	those	they	fail	to	recognize,	the y	attack.	The	attack
either	 defends	 us	 against	 viruses,	 bacteria,	 and	 ca ncer	 or,	 if	 the
immune	 cells	 misidentify	 some	 of	 the	 body’s	 own	 cells,	 creates	 an
autoimmune	disease	such	as	allergy	or	lupus.	Until	th e	day	Ader	made
======================================== [Página 191] ========================================

his	 serendipitous	 discovery,	 every	 anatomist,	 every	 physician,	 and
every	 biologist	 believed	 that	 the	 brain	 (along	 with 	 its	 extensions
throughout	the	body	via	the	central	nervous	system)	 and	the	immune
system	were	separate	entities,	neither	able	to	influ ence	the	operation
of	 the	 other.	 There	 was	 no	 pathway	 that	 could	 conne ct	 the	 brain
centers	monitoring	what	the	rat	tasted	with	the	area s	of	bone	marrow
that	manufacture	T	cells.	Or	so	it	had	been	thought	for	a	centur y.
Over	the	years	since	then,	Ader’s	modest	discovery	has	forced 	a	new
look	at	the	links	between	the	immune	system	and	the	ce ntral	nervous
system.	The	field	that	studies	this,	psychoneuroimmunology,	o r	PNI,	is
now	a	leading-edge	medical	science.	Its	very	name	ack nowledges	the
links:	psycho ,	or	“mind”;	neuro ,	for	the	neuroendocrine	system	(which
subsumes	the	nervous	system	and	hormone	systems);	and	 immunology ,
for	the	immune	system.
A	 network	 of	 researchers	 is	 finding	 that	 the	 chemica l	 messengers
that	operate	most	extensively	in	both	brain	and	immune 	system	are
those	 that	 are	 most	 dense	 in	 neural	 areas	 that	 regul ate	 emotion. 2
Some	of	the	strongest	evidence	for	a	direct	physical 	pathway	allowing
emotions	to	impact	the	immune	system	has	come	from	David	F elten,	a
colleague	 of	 Ader’s.	 Felten	 began	 by	 noting	 that	 emo tions	 have	 a
powerful	 effect	 on	 the	 autonomic	 nervous	 system,	 whic h	 regulates
everything	from	how	much	insulin	is	secreted	to	blood-pressur e	levels.
Felten,	 working	 with	 his	 wife,	 Suzanne,	 and	 other	 c olleagues,	 then
detected	 a	 meeting	 point	 where	 the	 autonomic	 nervous	 system
directly	talks	to	lymphocytes	and	macrophages,	cells	 of	the	immune
system. 3
In	 electron-microscope	 studies,	 they	 found	 synapseli ke	 contacts
where	the	nerve	terminals	of	the	autonomic	system	have 	endings	that
directly	 abut	 these	 immune	 cells.	 This	 physical	 conta ct	 point	 allows
the	 nerve	 cells	 to	 release	 neurotransmitters	 to	 regu late	 the	 immune
cells;	indeed,	they	signal	back	and	forth.	The	find ing	is	revolutionary.
No	one	had	suspected	that	immune	cells	could	be	targe ts	of	messages
from	the	nerves.
To	test	how	important	these	nerve	endings	were	in	th e	workings	of
the	immune	system,	Felten	went	a	step	further.	In	expe riments	with
animals	 he	 removed	 some	 nerves	 from	 lymph	 nodes	 and	 sple en—
where	 immune	 cells	 are	 stored	 or	 made—and	 then	 used	 vir uses	 to
challenge	 the	 immune	 system.	 The	 result:	 a	 huge	 drop	 i n	 immune
response	 to	 the	 virus.	 His	 conclusion	 is	 that	 withou t	 those	 nerve
endings	the	immune	system	simply	does	not	respond	as	it 	should	to
======================================== [Página 192] ========================================

the	challenge	of	an	invading	virus	or	bacterium.	In	 short,	the	nervous
system	not	only	connects	to	the	immune	system,	but	is	e ssential	for
proper	immune	function.
Another	key	pathway	linking	emotions	and	the	immune	sy stem	is
via	 the	 influence	 of	 the	 hormones	 released	 under	 str ess.	 The
catecholamines	 (epinephrine	 and	 norepinephrine—otherw ise	 known
as	 adrenaline	 and	 noradrenaline),	 cortisol	 and	 prol actin,	 and	 the
natural	opiates	beta-endorphin	and	enkephalin	are	a ll	released	during
stress	arousal.	Each	has	a	strong	impact	on	immune	cel ls.	While	the
relationships	 are	 complex,	 the	 main	 influence	 is	 that 	 while	 these
hormones	surge	through	the	body,	the	immune	cells	are	 hampered	in
their	 function:	 stress	 suppresses	 immune	 resistance,	 at	 least
temporarily,	 presumably	 in	 a	 conservation	 of	 energy	 t hat	 puts	 a
priority	 on	 the	 more	 immediate	 emergency,	 which	 is	 more	 pressing
for	survival.	But	if	stress	is	constant	and	intense ,	that	suppression	may
become	long-lasting. 4
Microbiologists	and	other	scientists	are	finding	mor e	and	more	such
connections	 between	 the	 brain	 and	 the	 cardiovascula r	 and	 immune
systems—having	first	had	to	accept	the	once-radical	n otion	that	they
exist	at	all. 5
TOXIC	EMOTIONS:	THE	CLINICAL	DATA
Despite	such	evidence,	many	or	most	physicians	are	st ill	skeptical	that
emotions	 matter	 clinically.	 One	 reason	 is	 that	 while	 many	 studies
have	found	stress	and	negative	emotions	to	weaken	th e	effectiveness
of	various	immune	cells,	it	is	not	always	clear	that	 the	range	of	these
changes	is	great	enough	to	make	a	 medical 	difference.
Even	so,	an	increasing	number	of	physicians	acknowle dge	the	place
of	emotions	in	medicine.	For	instance,	Dr.	Camran	Nezh at,	an	eminent
gynecological	 laparoscopic	 surgeon	 at	 Stanford	 Univ ersity,	 says,	 “If
someone	scheduled	for	surgery	tells	me	she’s	panicked 	that	day	and
does	 not	 want	 to	 go	 through	 with	 it,	 I	 cancel	 the	 s urgery.”	 Nezhat
explains,	“Every	surgeon	knows	that	people	who	are	 extremely	scared
do	 terribly	 in	 surgery.	 They	 bleed	 too	 much,	 they	 ha ve	 more
infections	and	complications.	They	have	a	harder	time 	recovering.	It’s
much	better	if	they	are	calm.”
The	 reason	 is	 straightforward:	 panic	 and	 anxiety	 hi ke	 blood
pressure,	and	veins	distended	by	pressure	bleed	more 	profusely	when
======================================== [Página 193] ========================================

cut	 by	 the	 surgeon’s	 knife.	 Excess	 bleeding	 is	 one	 of	 the	 most
troublesome	 surgical	 complications,	 one	 that	 can	 somet imes	 lead	 to
death.
Beyond	such	medical	anecdotes,	evidence	for	the	 clinical 	importance
of	emotions	has	been	mounting	steadily.	Perhaps	the	mo st	compelling
data	 on	 the	 medical	 significance	 of	 emotion	 come	 from	 a 	 mass
analysis	 combining	 results	 from	 101	 smaller	 studies	 in to	 a	 single
larger	one	of	several	thousand	men	and	women.	The	stu dy	confirms
that	 perturbing	 emotions	 are	 bad	 for	 health—to	 a	 degr ee.6	 People
who	 experienced	 chronic	 anxiety,	 long	 periods	 of	 sa dness	 and
pessimism,	 unremitting	 tension	 or	 incessant	 hostility, 	 relentless
cynicism	 or	 suspiciousness,	 were	 found	 to	 have	 double 	 the	 risk	 of
disease—including	 asthma,	 arthritis,	 headaches,	 pepti c	 ulcers,	 and
heart	 disease	 (each	 representative	 of	 major,	 broad	 c ategories	 of
disease).	This	order	of	magnitude	makes	distressing	e motions	as	toxic
a	risk	factor	as,	say,	smoking	or	high	cholesterol	a re	for	heart	disease
—in	other	words,	a	major	threat	to	health.
To	be	sure,	this	is	a	broad	statistical	link,	and	b y	no	means	indicates
that	everyone	who	has	such	chronic	feelings	will	th us	more	easily	fall
prey	to	a	disease.	But	the	evidence	for	a	potent	ro le	for	emotion	in
disease	is	far	more	extensive	than	this	one	study	of 	studies	indicates.
Taking	 a	 more	 detailed	 look	 at	 the	 data	 for	 specific 	 emotions,
especially	 the	 big	 three—anger,	 anxiety,	 and	 depress ion—makes
clearer	 some	 specific	 ways	 that	 feelings	 have	 medical 	 significance,
even	if	the	biological	mechanisms	by	which	such	emotio ns	have	their
effect	are	yet	to	be	fully	understood. 7
When	Anger	Is	Suicidal
A	 while	 back,	 the	 man	 said,	 a	 bump	 on	 the	 side	 of	 his	 car	 led	 to	 a	 fruitless	 and
frustrating	 journey.	 After	 endless	 insurance	 company	 r ed	 tape	 and	 auto	 body	 shops
that	did	more	damage,	he	still	owed	$800.	And	it	wasn’t 	even	his	fault.	He	was	so	fed
up	that	whenever	he	got	into	the	car	he	was	overcome	with	 disgust.	He	finally	sold	the
car	in	frustration.	Years	later	the	memories	still	made	 the	man	livid	with	outrage.
This	 bitter	 memory	 was	 brought	 to	 mind	 purposely,	 as	 p art	 of	 a
study	of	anger	in	heart	patients	at	Stanford	Univer sity	Medical	School.
All	the	patients	in	the	study	had,	like	this	embitte red	man,	suffered	a
first	heart	attack,	and	the	question	was	whether	an ger	might	have	a
significant	impact	of	some	kind	on	their	heart	functi on.	The	effect	was
======================================== [Página 194] ========================================

striking:	while	the	patients	recounted	incidents	th at	made	them	mad,
the	 pumping	 efficiency	 of	 their	 hearts	 dropped	 by	 fi ve	 percentage
points. 8	Some	of	the	patients	showed	a	drop	in	pumping	effici ency	of
7	percent	or	greater—a	range	that	cardiologists	rega rd	as	a	sign	of	a
myocardial	 ischemia,	 a	 dangerous	 drop	 in	 blood	 flow	 t o	 the	 heart
itself.
The	drop	in	pumping	efficiency	was	not	seen	with	oth er	distressing
feelings,	such	as	anxiety,	nor	during	physical	exer tion;	anger	seems	to
be	the	one	emotion	that	does	most	harm	to	the	heart.	W hile	recalling
the	upsetting	incident,	the	patients	said	they	were 	only	about	half	as
mad	as	they	had	been	while	it	was	happening,	suggest ing	that	their
hearts	would	have	been	even	more	greatly	hampered	dur ing	an	actual
angry	encounter.
This	finding	is	part	of	a	larger	network	of	evidenc e	emerging	from
dozens	of	studies	pointing	to	the	power	of	anger	to	damage	the	h eart. 9
The	 old	 idea	 has	 not	 held	 up	 that	 a	 hurried,	 high-p ressure	 Type-A
personality	 is	 at	 great	 risk	 from	 heart	 disease,	 but 	 from	 that	 failed
theory	has	emerged	a	new	finding:	it	is	hostility	th at	puts	people	at
risk.
Much	 of	 the	 data	 on	 hostility	 has	 come	 from	 research	 by	 Dr.
Redford	Williams	at	Duke	University. 10	For	example,	Williams	found
that	 those	 physicians	 who	 had	 had	 the	 highest	 score s	 on	 a	 test	 of
hostility	 while	 still	 in	 medical	 school	 were	 seven	 t imes	 as	 likely	 to
have	died	by	the	age	of	fifty	as	were	those	with	lo w	hostility	scores—
being	 prone	 to	 anger	 was	 a	 stronger	 predictor	 of	 dy ing	 young	 than
were	other	risk	factors	such	as	smoking,	high	blood	 pressure,	and	high
cholesterol.	 And	 findings	 by	 a	 colleague,	 Dr.	 John	 Barefoot	 at	 the
University	of	North	Carolina,	show	that	in	heart	pa tients	undergoing
angiography,	in	which	a	tube	is	inserted	into	the	c oronary	artery	to
measure	lesions,	scores	on	a	test	of	hostility	corre late	with	the	extent
and	severity	of	coronary	artery	disease.
Of	course,	no	one	is	saying	that	anger	alone	causes 	coronary	artery
disease;	 it	 is	 one	 of	 several	 interacting	 factors.	 As	 Peter	 Kaufman,
acting	chief	of	the	Behavioral	Medicine	Branch	of	t he	National	Heart,
Lung,	 and	 Blood	 Institute,	 explained	 to	 me,	 “We	 can’ t	 yet	 sort	 out
whether	 anger	 and	 hostility	 play	 a	 causal	 role	 in	 t he	 early
development	of	coronary	artery	disease,	or	whether	i t	intensifies	the
problem	 once	 heart	 disease	 has	 begun,	 or	 both.	 But	 t ake	 a	 twenty-
year-old	 who	 repeatedly	 gets	 angry.	 Each	 episode	 of 	 anger	 adds	 an
additional	stress	to	 the	heart	by	 increasing	his	he art	 rate	and	blood
======================================== [Página 195] ========================================

pressure.	 When	 that	 is	 repeated	 over	 and	 over	 again ,	 it	 can	 do
damage,”	especially	because	the	turbulence	of	blood	 flowing	through
the	coronary	artery	with	each	heartbeat	“can	cause	 microtears	in	the
vessel,	where	plaque	develops.	If	your	heart	rate	i s	faster	and	blood
pressure	 is	 higher	 because	 you’re	 habitually	 angry, 	 then	 over	 thirty
years	 that	 may	 lead	 to	 a	 faster	 buildup	 of	 plaque,	 a nd	 so	 lead	 to
coronary	artery	disease.” 11
Once	 heart	 disease	 develops,	 the	 mechanisms	 triggered 	 by	 anger
affect	the	very	efficiency	of	the	heart	as	a	pump,	a s	was	shown	in	the
study	of	angry	memories	in	heart	patients.	The	net	ef fect	is	to	make
anger	particularly	lethal	in	those	who	already	have 	heart	disease.	For
instance,	 a	 Stanford	 University	 Medical	 School	 stud y	 of	 1,012	 men
and	 women	 who	 suffered	 from	 a	 first	 heart	 attack	 and	 then	 were
followed	for	up	to	eight	years	showed	that	those	men 	who	were	most
aggressive	and	hostile	at	the	outset	suffered	the	h ighest	rate	of	second
heart	 attacks. 12	 There	 were	 similar	 results	 in	 a	 Yale	 School	 of
Medicine	study	of	929	men	who	had	survived	heart	att acks	and	were
tracked	 for	 up	 to	 ten	 years. 13	 Those	 who	 had	 been	 rated	 as	 easily
roused	to	anger	were	three	times	more	likely	to	die	o f	cardiac	arrest
than	 those	 who	 were	 more	 even-tempered.	 If	 they	 also	 had	 high
cholesterol	levels,	the	added	risk	from	anger	was	five	times	hi gher.
The	Yale	researchers	point	out	that	it	may	not	be	an ger	alone	that
heightens	 the	 risk	 of	 death	 from	 heart	 disease,	 but	 rather	 intense
negative	emotionality	of	any	kind	that	regularly	sen ds	surges	of	stress
hormones	through	the	body.	But	overall,	the	stronges t	scientific	links
between	emotions	and	heart	disease	are	to	anger:	a	Ha rvard	Medical
School	study	asked	more	than	fifteen	hundred	men	and	 women	who
had	 suffered	 heart	 attacks	 to	 describe	 their	 emotion al	 state	 in	 the
hours	 before	 the	 attack.	 Being	 angry	 more	 than	 doubl ed	 the	 risk	 of
cardiac	arrest	in	people	who	already	had	heart	disease;	the	h eightened
risk	lasted	for	about	two	hours	after	the	anger	was	aroused. 14
These	findings	do	not	mean	that	people	should	try	to	suppress	a nger
when	 it	 is	 appropriate.	 Indeed,	 there	 is	 evidence	 t hat	 trying	 to
completely	suppress	such	feelings	in	the	heat	of	the 	moment	actually
results	 in	 magnifying	 the	 body’s	 agitation	 and	 may	 ra ise	 blood
pressure. 15	On	the	other	hand,	as	we	saw	in	 Chapter	5 ,	the	net	effect
of	ventilating	anger	every	time	it	is	felt	is	simply	 to	feed	it,	making	it
a	 more	 likely	 response	 to	 any	 annoying	 situation.	 Wi lliams	 resolves
this	paradox	by	concluding	that	whether	anger	is	ex pressed	or	not	is
less	 important	 than	 whether	 it	 is	 chronic.	 An	 occasi onal	 display	 of
======================================== [Página 196] ========================================

hostility	is	not	dangerous	to	health;	the	problem	ar ises	when	hostility
becomes	so	constant	as	to	define	an	antagonistic	per sonal	style—one
marked	 by	 repeated	 feelings	 of	 mistrust	 and	 cynicism	 a nd	 the
propensity	to	snide	comments	and	put-downs,	as	well	a s	more	obvious
bouts	of	temper	and	rage. 16
The	 hopeful	 news	 is	 that	 chronic	 anger	 need	 not	 be	 a	 death
sentence:	 hostility	 is	 a	 habit	 that	 can	 change.	 One 	 group	 of	 heart-
attack	patients	at	Stanford	University	Medical	Scho ol	was	enrolled	in
a	program	designed	to	help	them	soften	the	attitudes	 that	gave	them	a
short	 temper.	 This	 anger-control	 training	 resulted	 i n	 a	 second-heart-
attack	 rate	 44	 percent	 lower	 than	 for	 those	 who	 had 	 not	 tried	 to
change	 their	 hostility. 17	 A	 program	 designed	 by	 Williams	 has	 had
similar	beneficial	results. 18	Like	the	Stanford	program,	it	teaches	basic
elements	of	emotional	intelligence,	particularly	mindf ulness	of	anger
as	 it	 begins	 to	 stir,	 the	 ability	 to	 regulate	 it	 on ce	 it	 has	 begun,	 and
empathy.	Patients	are	asked	to	jot	down	cynical	or	h ostile	thoughts	as
they	notice	them.	If	the	thoughts	persist,	they	try	 to	short-circuit	them
by	saying	(or	thinking),	“Stop!”	And	they	are	encou raged	to	purposely
substitute	 reasonable	 thoughts	 for	 cynical,	 mistrust ful	 ones	 during
trying	situations—for	instance,	if	an	elevator	is	de layed,	to	search	for
a	 benign	 reason	 rather	 than	 harbor	 anger	 against	 so me	 imagined
thoughtless	 person	 who	 may	 be	 responsible	 for	 the	 de lay.	 For
frustrating	 encounters,	 they	 learn	 the	 ability	 to	 s ee	 things	 from	 the
other	person’s	perspective—empathy	is	a	balm	for	anger.
As	Williams	told	me,	“The	antidote	to	hostility	is	to 	develop	a	more
trusting	 heart.	 All	 it	 takes	 is	 the	 right	 motivation .	 When	 people	 see
that	their	hostility	can	lead	to	an	early	grave,	they	are	read y	to	try.”
Stress:	Anxiety	Out	of	Proportion	and	Out	of	Place
I	just	feel	anxious	and	tense	all	the	time.	It	all	sta rted	in	high	school.	I	was	a	straight-A
student,	 and	 I	 worried	 constantly	 about	 my	 grades,	 w hether	 the	 other	 kids	 and	 the
teachers	 liked	 me,	 being	 prompt	 for	 classes—things	 like	 t hat.	 There	 was	 a	 lot	 of
pressure	from	my	parents	to	do	well	in	school	and	to	be 	a	good	role	model.…	I	guess	I
just	 caved	 in	 to	 all	 that	 pressure,	 because	 my	 stomach	 problems	 began	 in	 my
sophomore	 year	 of	 high	 school.	 Since	 that	 time,	 I’ve	 had	 to	 be	 really	 careful	 about
drinking	 caffeine	 and	 eating	 spicy	 meals.	 I	 notice	 that 	 when	 I’m	 feeling	 worried	 or
tense	my	stomach	will	flare	up,	and	since	I’m	usually	wo rried	about	something,	I’m
always	nauseous.19
======================================== [Página 197] ========================================

Anxiety—the	 distress	 evoked	 by	 life’s	 pressures—is	 pe rhaps	 the
emotion	with	the	greatest	weight	of	scientific	evide nce	connecting	it
to	the	onset	of	sickness	and	course	of	recovery.	Wh en	anxiety	helps	us
prepare	to	deal	with	some	danger	(a	presumed	utility	 in	evolution),
then	it	has	served	us	well.	But	in	modern	life	anxiety	is	more	oft en	out
of	proportion	and	out	of	place—distress	comes	in	the	face	of	sit uations
that	 we	 must	 live	 with	 or	 that	 are	 conjured	 by	 the	 mi nd,	 not	 real
dangers	 we	 need	 to	 confront.	 Repeated	 bouts	 of	 anxi ety	 signal	 high
levels	 of	 stress.	 The	 woman	 whose	 constant	 worrying	 primes	 her
gastrointestinal	 trouble	 is	 a	 textbook	 example	 of	 ho w	 anxiety	 and
stress	exacerbate	medical	problems.
In	 a	 1993	 review	 in	 the	 Archives	of	Internal	Medicine 	 of	 extensive
research	 on	 the	 stress-disease	 link,	 Yale	 psycholog ist	 Bruce	 McEwen
noted	a	broad	spectrum	of	effects:	compromising	immune	f unction	to
the	 point	 that	 it	 can	 speed	 the	 metastasis	 of	 cancer ;	 increasing
vulnerability	 to	 viral	 infections;	 exacerbating	 pla que	 formation
leading	 to	 atherosclerosis	 and	 blood	 clotting	 leadi ng	 to	 myocardial
infarction;	accelerating	the	onset	of	Type	I	diabet es	and	the	course	of
Type	 II	 diabetes;	 and	 worsening	 or	 triggering	 an	 as thma	 attack. 20
Stress	 can	 also	 lead	 to	 ulceration	 of	 the	 gastroint estinal	 tract,
triggering	symptoms	in	ulcerative	colitis	and	in	infl ammatory	bowel
disease.	 The	 brain	 itself	 is	 susceptible	 to	 the	 lon g-term	 effects	 of
sustained	 stress,	 including	 damage	 to	 the	 hippocampus ,	 and	 so	 to
memory.	 In	 general,	 says	 McEwen,	 “evidence	 is	 mounting 	 that	 the
nervous	 system	 is	 subject	 to	 ‘wear	 and	 tear’	 as	 a	 re sult	 of	 stressful
experiences.” 21
Particularly	 compelling	 evidence	 for	 the	 medical	 impac t	 from
distress	has	come	from	studies	with	infectious	diseas es	such	as	colds,
the	flu,	and	herpes.	We	are	continually	exposed	to	 such	viruses,	but
ordinarily	 our	 immune	 system	 fights	 them	 off—except	 that 	 under
emotional	 stress	 those	 defenses	 more	 often	 fail.	 In	 e xperiments	 in
which	the	robustness	of	the	immune	system	has	been	ass ayed	directly,
stress	 and	 anxiety	 have	 been	 found	 to	 weaken	 it,	 bu t	 in	 most	 such
results	 it	 is	 unclear	 whether	 the	 range	 of	 immune	 wea kening	 is	 of
clinical	 significance—that	 is,	 great	 enough	 to	 open	 the	 way	 to
disease. 22	For	that	reason	stronger	scientific	links	of	stres s	and	anxiety
to	 medical	 vulnerability	 come	 from	 prospective	 studies :	 those	 that
start	with	healthy	people	and	monitor	first	a	height ening	of	distress
followed	 by	 a	 weakening	 of	 the	 immune	 system	 and	 the	 o nset	 of
illness.
======================================== [Página 198] ========================================

In	one	of	the	most	scientifically	compelling	studies, 	Sheldon	Cohen,
a	psychologist	at	Carnegie-Mellon	University,	worki ng	with	scientists
at	 a	 specialized	 colds	 research	 unit	 in	 Sheffield,	 England,	 carefully
assessed	how	much	stress	people	were	feeling	in	thei r	lives,	and	then
systematically	exposed	them	to	a	cold	virus.	Not	ever yone	so	exposed
actually	comes	down	with	a	cold;	a	robust	immune	syste m	can—and
constantly	 does—resist	 the	 cold	 virus.	 Cohen	 found	 t hat	 the	 more
stress	in	their	lives,	the	more	likely	people	were	t o	catch	cold.	Among
those	with	little	stress,	27	percent	came	down	with	 a	cold	after	being
exposed	 to	 the	 virus;	 among	 those	 with	 the	 most	 stres sful	 lives,	 47
percent	 got	 the	 cold—direct	 evidence	 that	 stress	 its elf	 weakens	 the
immune	system. 23	 (While	 this	 may	 be	 one	 of	 those	 scientific	 results
that	confirms	what	everyone	has	observed	or	suspecte d	all	along,	it	is
considered	a	landmark	finding	because	of	its	scientific	rigo r.)
Likewise,	 married	 couples	 who	 for	 three	 months	 kept	 d aily
checklists	 of	 hassles	 and	 upsetting	 events	 such	 as	 marital	 fights
showed	a	strong	pattern:	three	or	four	days	after	a n	especially	intense
batch	 of	 upsets,	 they	 came	 down	 with	 a	 cold	 or	 upper -respiratory
infection.	 That	 lag	 period	 is	 precisely	 the	 incubat ion	 time	 for	 many
common	cold	viruses,	suggesting	that	being	exposed	wh ile	they	were
most	worried	and	upset	made	them	especially	vulnerable. 24
The	same	stress-infection	pattern	holds	for	the	herp es	virus—both
the	 type	 that	 causes	 cold	 sores	 on	 the	 lip	 and	 the	 type	 that	 causes
genital	lesions.	Once	people	have	been	exposed	to	t he	herpes	virus,	it
stays	latent	in	the	body,	flaring	up	from	time	to	time .	The	activity	of
the	 herpes	 virus	 can	 be	 tracked	 by	 levels	 of	 antibo dies	 to	 it	 in	 the
blood.	Using	this	measure,	reactivation	of	the	herpe s	virus	has	been
found	 in	 medical	 students	 undergoing	 year-end	 exams,	 in	 recently
separated	 women,	 and	 among	 people	 under	 constant	 pres sure	 from
caring	for	a	family	member	with	Alzheimer’s	disease. 25
The	toll	of	anxiety	is	not	just	that	it	lowers	the	 immune	response;
other	 research	 is	 showing	 adverse	 effects	 on	 the	 ca rdiovascular
system.	While	chronic	hostility	and	repeated	episode s	of	anger	seem
to	put	men	at	greatest	risk	for	heart	disease,	the	mo re	deadly	emotion
in	women	may	be	anxiety	and	fear.	In	research	at	Stan ford	University
School	of	Medicine	with	more	than	a	thousand	men	and	 women	who
had	suffered	a	first	heart	attack,	those	women	who	w ent	on	to	suffer	a
second	 heart	 attack	 were	 marked	 by	 high	 levels	 of	 fe arfulness	 and
anxiety.	 In	 many	 cases	 the	 fearfulness	 took	 the	 form	 of	 crippling
phobias:	after	their	first	heart	attack	the	patient s	stopped	driving,	quit
======================================== [Página 199] ========================================

their	jobs,	or	avoided	going	out. 26
The	insidious	physical	effects	of	mental	stress	and	anxiety—t he	kind
produced	by	high-pressure	jobs,	or	high-pressure	li ves	such	as	that	of
a	single	mother	juggling	day	care	and	a	job—are	being 	pinpointed	at
an	 anatomically	 fine-grained	 level.	 For	 example,	 Step hen	 Manuck,	 a
University	of	Pittsburgh	psychologist,	put	thirty	v olunteers	through	a
rigorous,	 anxiety-riddled	 ordeal	 in	 a	 laboratory	 wh ile	 he	 monitored
the	 men’s	 blood,	 assaying	 a	 substance	 secreted	 by	 bl ood	 platelets
called	adenosine	triphosphate,	or	ATP,	which	can	tr igger	blood-vessel
changes	 that	 may	 lead	 to	 heart	 attacks	 and	 strokes.	 While	 the
volunteers	were	under	the	intense	stress,	their	ATP	levels	r ose	sharply,
as	did	their	heart	rate	and	blood	pressure.
Understandably,	health	risks	seem	greatest	for	those 	whose	jobs	are
high	 in	 “strain”:	 having	 high-pressure	 performance	 d emands	 while
having	 little	 or	 no	 control	 over	 how	 to	 get	 the	 job 	 done	 (a
predicament	 that	 gives	 bus	 drivers,	 for	 instance,	 a	 high	 rate	 of
hypertension).	For	example,	in	a	study	of	569	patien ts	with	colorectal
cancer	and	a	matched	comparison	group,	those	who	said 	that	in	the
previous	ten	years	they	had	experienced	severe	on-the-job	a ggravation
were	five	and	a	half	times	more	likely	to	have	devel oped	the	cancer
compared	to	those	with	no	such	stress	in	their	lives. 27
Because	 the	 medical	 toll	 of	 distress	 is	 so	 broad,	 re laxation
techniques—which	directly	counter	the	physiological	 arousal	of	stress
—are	being	used	clinically	to	ease	the	symptoms	of	a	w ide	variety	of
chronic	illnesses.	These	include	cardiovascular	dis ease,	some	types	of
diabetes,	 arthritis,	 asthma,	 gastrointestinal	 disord ers,	 and	 chronic
pain,	to	name	a	few.	To	the	degree	any	symptoms	are	wo rsened	by
stress	 and	 emotional	 distress,	 helping	 patients	 beco me	 more	 relaxed
and	 able	 to	 handle	 their	 turbulent	 feelings	 can	 oft en	 offer	 some
reprieve. 28
The	Medical	Costs	of	Depression
She	 had	 been	 diagnosed	 with	 metastatic	 breast	 cancer,	 a 	 return	 and	 spread	 of	 the
malignancy	 several	 years	 after	 what	 she	 had	 thought	 was	 su ccessful	 surgery	 for	 the
disease.	 Her	 doctor	 could	 no	 longer	 talk	 of	 a	 cure,	 and	 the	 chemotherapy,	 at	 best,
might	 offer	 just	 a	 few	 more	 months	 of	 life.	 Understandably,	 s he	 was	 depressed—so
much	 so	 that	 whenever	 she	 went	 to	 her	 oncologist,	 she	 foun d	 herself	 at	 some	 point
bursting	 out	 into	 tears.	 Her	 oncologist’s	 response	 each	 time:	 asking	 her	 to	 leave	 the
======================================== [Página 200] ========================================

office	immediately.
Apart	from	the	hurtfulness	of	the	oncologist’s	coldn ess,	did	it	matter
medically	that	he	would	not	deal	with	his	patient’s	 constant	sadness?
By	 the	 time	 a	 disease	 has	 become	 so	 virulent,	 it	 woul d	 be	 unlikely
that	 any	 emotion	 would	 have	 an	 appreciable	 effect	 on 	 its	 progress.
While	the	woman’s	depression	most	certainly	dimmed	the	 quality	of
her	final	months,	the	medical	evidence	that	melancholy 	might	affect
the	course	of	cancer	is	as	yet	mixed. 29	But	cancer	aside,	a	smattering
of	 studies	 suggest	 a	 role	 for	 depression	 in	 many	 oth er	 medical
conditions,	especially	in	worsening	a	sickness	once 	it	has	begun.	The
evidence	 is	 mounting	 that	 for	 patients	 with	 serious	 disease	 who	 are
depressed,	it	would	pay	medically	to	treat	their	depression	t oo.
One	complication	in	treating	depression	in	medical	pa tients	is	that
its	 symptoms,	 including	 loss	 of	 appetite	 and	 lethargy ,	 are	 easily
mistaken	 for	 signs	 of	 other	 diseases,	 particularly	 b y	 physicians	 with
little	 training	 in	 psychiatric	 diagnosis.	 That	 inab ility	 to	 diagnose
depression	 may	 itself	 add	 to	 the	 problem,	 since	 it	 mea ns	 that	 a
patient’s	 depression—like	 that	 of	 the	 weepy	 breast-c ancer	 patient—
goes	unnoticed	and	untreated.	And	that	failure	to	d iagnose	and	treat
may	add	to	the	risk	of	death	in	severe	disease.
For	 instance,	 of	 100	 patients	 who	 received	 bone	 marr ow
transplants,	12	of	the	13	who	had	been	depressed	di ed	within	the	first
year	of	the	transplant,	while	34	of	the	remaining	87 	were	still	alive
two	 years	 later. 30	 And	 in	 patients	 with	 chronic	 kidney	 failure	 who
were	 receiving	 dialysis,	 those	 who	 were	 diagnosed	 w ith	 major
depression	 were	 most	 likely	 to	 die	 within	 the	 follow ing	 two	 years;
depression	was	a	stronger	predictor	of	death	than	a ny	medical	sign. 31
Here	 the	 route	 connecting	 emotion	 to	 medical	 status	 wa s	 not
biological	 but	 attitudinal:	 The	 depressed	 patients	 were	 much	 worse
about	 complying	 with	 their	 medical	 regimens—cheating	 on 	 their
diets,	for	example,	which	put	them	at	higher	risk.
Heart	disease	too	seems	to	be	exacerbated	by	depressi on.	In	a	study
of	2,832	middle-aged	men	and	women	tracked	for	twelve	 years,	those
who	felt	a	sense	of	nagging	despair	and	hopelessness	had	a	hei ghtened
rate	of	death	from	heart	disease. 32	And	for	the	3	percent	or	so	who
were	 most	 severely	 depressed,	 the	 death	 rate	 from	 hea rt	 disease,
compared	 to	 the	 rate	 for	 those	 with	 no	 feelings	 of	 d epression,	 was
four	times	greater.
Depression	seems	to	pose	a	particularly	grave	medical 	risk	for	heart

attack	survivors. 33	In	a	study	of	patients	in	a	Montreal	hospital	who
were	discharged	after	being	treated	for	a	first	hea rt	attack,	depressed
patients	 had	 a	 sharply	 higher	 risk	 of	 dying	 within	 the	 following	 six
months.	 Among	 the	 one	 in	 eight	 patients	 who	 were	 seri ously
depressed,	the	death	rate	was	five	times	higher	than 	for	others	with
comparable	disease—an	effect	as	great	as	that	of	major 	medical	risks
for	cardiac	death,	such	as	left	ventricular	dysfunc tion	or	a	history	of
previous	 heart	 attacks.	 Among	 the	 possible	 mechanisms	 that	 might
explain	why	depression	so	greatly	increases	the	odd s	of	a	later	heart
attack	 are	 its	 effects	 on	 heart	 rate	 variability,	 i ncreasing	 the	 risk	 of
fatal	arrhythmias.
Depression	 has	 also	 been	 found	 to	 complicate	 recover y	 from	 hip
fracture.	 In	 a	 study	 of	 elderly	 women	 with	 hip	 fract ure,	 several
thousand	were	given	psychiatric	evaluations	on	thei r	admission	to	the
hospital.	Those	who	were	depressed	on	admission	stay ed	an	average
of	 eight	 days	 longer	 than	 those	 with	 comparable	 inju ry	 but	 no
depression,	 and	 were	 only	 a	 third	 as	 likely	 ever	 to 	 walk	 again.	 But
depressed	women	who	had	psychiatric	help	for	their	d epression	along
with	 other	 medical	 care	 needed	 less	 physical	 therapy 	 to	 walk	 again
and	 had	 fewer	 rehospitalizations	 over	 the	 three	 mont hs	 after	 their
return	home	from	the	hospital.
Likewise,	 in	 a	 study	 of	 patients	 whose	 condition	 wa s	 so	 dire	 that
they	were	among	the	top	10	percent	of	those	using	med ical	services—
often	because	of	having	multiple	illnesses,	such	as	 both	heart	disease
and	 diabetes—about	 one	 in	 six	 had	 serious	 depression .	 When	 these
patients	 were	 treated	 for	 the	 problem,	 the	 number	 of	 days	 per	 year
that	 they	 were	 disabled	 dropped	 from	 79	 to	 51	 for	 th ose	 who	 had
major	depression,	and	from	62	days	per	year	to	just	1 8	in	those	who
had	been	treated	for	mild	depression. 34
THE	MEDICAL	BENEFITS	OF	POSITIVE	FEELINGS
The	 cumulative	 evidence	 for	 adverse	 medical	 effects	 f rom	 anger,
anxiety,	and	depression,	then,	is	compelling.	Both	a nger	and	anxiety,
when	 chronic,	 can	 make	 people	 more	 susceptible	 to	 a	 r ange	 of
disease.	And	while	depression	may	not	make	people	more 	vulnerable
to	 becoming	 ill,	 it	 does	 seem	 to	 impede	 medical	 recover y	 and
heighten	 the	 risk	 of	 death,	 especially	 with	 more	 fra il	 patients	 with
severe	conditions.
======================================== [Página 202] ========================================

But	 if	 chronic	 emotional	 distress	 in	 its	 many	 forms	 is 	 toxic,	 the
opposite	 range	 of	 emotion	 can	 be	 tonic—to	 a	 degree.	 T his	 by	 no
means	 says	 that	 positive	 emotion	 is	 curative,	 or	 that 	 laughter	 or
happiness	 alone	 will	 turn	 the	 course	 of	 a	 serious	 d isease.	 The	 edge
positive	emotions	offer	seems	subtle,	but,	by	using	s tudies	with	large
numbers	of	people,	can	be	teased	out	of	the	mass	of	c omplex	variables
that	affect	the	course	of	disease.
The	Price	of	Pessimism—and	Advantages	of	Optimism
As	 with	 depression,	 there	 are	 medical	 costs	 to	 pessi mism—and
corresponding	 benefits	 from	 optimism.	 For	 example,	 122	 men	 who
had	their	first	heart	attack	were	evaluated	on	their	degree	o f	optimism
or	 pessimism.	 Eight	 years	 later,	 of	 the	 25	 most	 pessimi stic	 men,	 21
had	 died;	 of	 the	 25	 most	 optimistic,	 just	 6	 had	 died. 	 Their	 mental
outlook	 proved	 a	 better	 predictor	 of	 survival	 than	 any	 medical	 risk
factor,	including	the	amount	of	damage	to	the	heart	i n	the	first	attack,
artery	 blockage,	 cholesterol	 level,	 or	 blood	 pressu re.	 And	 in	 other
research,	 patients	 going	 into	 artery	 bypass	 surgery 	 who	 were	 more
optimistic	 had	 a	 much	 faster	 recovery	 and	 fewer	 medica l
complications	 during	 and	 after	 surgery	 than	 did	 more	 pessimistic
patients. 35
Like	its	near	cousin	optimism,	hope	has	healing	power .	People	who
have	 a	 great	 deal	 of	 hopefulness	 are,	 understandabl y,	 better	 able	 to
bear	up	under	trying	circumstances,	including	medical 	difficulties.	In
a	study	of	people	paralyzed	from	spinal	injuries,	th ose	who	had	more
hope	were	able	to	gain	greater	levels	of	physical	mo bility	compared	to
other	patients	with	similar	degrees	of	injury,	but	w ho	felt	less	hopeful.
Hope	 is	 especially	 telling	 in	 paralysis	 from	 spinal	 i njury,	 since	 this
medical	 tragedy	 typically	 involves	 a	 man	 who	 is	 paral yzed	 in	 his
twenties	by	an	accident	and	will	remain	so	for	the	r est	of	his	life.	How
he	reacts	emotionally	will	have	broad	consequences	f or	the	degree	to
which	he	will	make	the	efforts	that	might	bring	him	gr eater	physical
and	social	functioning. 36
Just	 why	 an	 optimistic	 or	 pessimistic	 outlook	 should	 have	 health
consequences	 is	 open	 to	 any	 of	 several	 explanations .	 One	 theory
proposes	that	pessimism	leads	to	depression,	which	in 	turn	interferes
with	the	resistance	of	the	immune	system	to	tumors	and	 infection—an
unproven	speculation	at	present.	Or	it	may	be	that	p essimists	neglect
themselves—some	studies	have	found	that	pessimists	smoke 	and	drink
======================================== [Página 203] ========================================

more,	and	exercise	less,	than	optimists,	and	are	gene rally	much	more
careless	about	their	health	habits.	Or	it	may	one	da y	turn	out	that	the
physiology	of	hopefulness	is	itself	somehow	helpful	 biologically	to	the
body’s	fight	against	disease.
With	a	Little	Help	From	My	Friends:
The	Medical	Value	of	Relationships
Add	the	sounds	of	silence	to	the	list	of	emotional	r isks	to	health—and
close	emotional	ties	to	the	list	of	protective	facto rs.	Studies	done	over
two	decades	involving	more	than	thirty-seven	thousan d	people	show
that	social	isolation—the	sense	that	you	have	nobody 	with	whom	you
can	 share	 your	 private	 feelings	 or	 have	 close	 conta ct—doubles	 the
chances	of	sickness	or	death. 37	Isolation	itself,	a	1987	report	in	 Science
concluded,	“is	as	significant	to	mortality	rates	as	 smoking,	high	blood
pressure,	 high	 cholesterol,	 obesity,	 and	 lack	 of	 ph ysical	 exercise.”
Indeed,	smoking	increases	mortality	risk	by	a	factor	 of	just	1.6,	while
social	isolation	does	so	by	a	factor	of	2.0,	making	 it	a	greater	health
risk. 38
Isolation	is	harder	on	men	than	on	women.	Isolated	men 	were	two
to	three	times	more	likely	to	die	as	were	men	with	clo se	social	ties;
for	isolated	women,	the	risk	was	one	and	a	half	times 	greater	than	for
more	 socially	 connected	 women.	 The	 difference	 between 	 men	 and
women	 in	 the	 impact	 of	 isolation	 may	 be	 because	 women’s
relationships	tend	to	be	emotionally	closer	than	men’ s;	a	few	strands
of	 such	 social	 ties	 for	 a	 woman	 may	 be	 more	 comforting	 than	 the
same	small	number	of	friendships	for	a	man.
Of	course,	solitude	is	not	the	same	as	isolation;	man y	people	who
live	on	their	own	or	see	few	friends	are	content	an d	healthy.	Rather,	it
is	the	subjective	sense	of	being	cut	off	from	people 	and	having	no	one
to	turn	to	that	is	the	medical	risk.	This	finding	is 	ominous	in	light	of
the	increasing	isolation	bred	by	solitary	TV-watchi ng	and	the	falling
away	 of	 social	 habits	 such	 as	 clubs	 and	 visits	 in	 mo dern	 urban
societies,	 and	 suggests	 an	 added	 value	 to	 self-help 	 groups	 such	 as
Alcoholics	Anonymous	as	surrogate	communities.
The	power	of	isolation	as	a	mortality	risk	factor—and 	the	healing
power	 of	 close	 ties—can	 be	 seen	 in	 the	 study	 of	 one	 hundred	 bone
marrow	 transplant	 patients. 39	 Among	 patients	 who	 felt	 they	 had
strong	 emotional	 support	 from	 their	 spouse,	 family,	 or 	 friends,	 54
percent	 survived	 the	 transplants	 after	 two	 years,	 v ersus	 just	 20
======================================== [Página 204] ========================================

percent	 among	 those	 who	 reported	 little	 such	 support .	 Similarly,
elderly	people	who	suffer	heart	attacks,	but	have	t wo	or	more	people
in	their	lives	they	can	rely	on	for	emotional	suppor t,	are	more	than
twice	as	likely	to	survive	longer	than	a	year	after 	an	attack	than	are
those	people	with	no	such	support. 40
Perhaps	 the	 most	 telling	 testimony	 to	 the	 healing	 pot ency	 of
emotional	 ties	 is	 a	 Swedish	 study	 published	 in	 1993. 41	 All	 the	 men
living	in	the	Swedish	city	of	Göteborg	who	were	bor n	in	1933	were
offered	a	free	medical	exam;	seven	years	later	the	75 2	men	who	had
come	for	the	exam	were	contacted	again.	Of	these,	41	 had	died	in	the
intervening	years.
Men	 who	 had	 originally	 reported	 being	 under	 intense 	 emotional
stress	had	a	death	rate	three	times	greater	than	tho se	who	said	their
lives	were	calm	and	placid.	The	emotional	distress	wa s	due	to	events
such	 as	 serious	 financial	 trouble,	 feeling	 insecure 	 at	 work	 or	 being
forced	out	of	a	job,	being	the	object	of	a	legal	action,	or	goin g	through
a	divorce.	Having	had	three	or	more	of	these	trouble s	within	the	year
before	the	exam	was	a	stronger	predictor	of	dying	wi thin	the	ensuing
seven	years	than	were	medical	indicators	such	as	hig h	blood	pressure,
high	concentrations	of	blood	triglycerides,	or	high 	serum	cholesterol
levels.
Yet	among	men	who	said	they	had	a	dependable	web	of	i ntimacy—
a	wife,	close	friends,	and	the	like— there	was	no	relationship	whatever
between	 high	 stress	 levels	 and	 death	 rate.	 Having	 pe ople	 to	 turn	 to
and	talk	with,	people	who	could	offer	solace,	help, 	and	suggestions,
protected	them	from	the	deadly	impact	of	life’s	rigors	and	trauma .
The	quality	of	relationships	as	well	as	their	sheer 	number	seems	key
to	buffering	stress.	Negative	relationships	take	th eir	own	toll.	Marital
arguments,	 for	 example,	 have	 a	 negative	 impact	 on	 the	 immune
system. 42	One	study	of	college	roommates	found	that	the	more	th ey
disliked	each	other,	the	more	susceptible	they	were	 to	colds	and	the
flu,	and	the	more	frequently	they	went	to	doctors.	J ohn	Cacioppo,	the
Ohio	State	University	psychologist	who	did	the	roomma te	study,	told
me,	“It’s	the	most	important	relationships	in	your	lif e,	the	people	you
see	day	in	and	day	out,	that	seem	to	be	crucial	for	 your	health.	And
the	 more	 significant	 the	 relationship	 is	 in	 your	 lif e,	 the	 more	 it
matters	for	your	health.” 43
The	Healing	Power	of	Emotional	Support
======================================== [Página 205] ========================================

In	The	Merry	Adventures	of	Robin	Hood ,	 Robin	 advises	 a	 young
follower:	“Tell	us	thy	troubles	and	speak	freely.	A 	flow	of	words	doth
ever	ease	the	heart	of	sorrows;	it	is	like	opening	 the	waste	where	the
mill	 dam	 is	 overfull.”	 This	 bit	 of	 folk	 wisdom	 has	 gre at	 merit;
unburdening	 a	 troubled	 heart	 appears	 to	 be	 good	 medi cine.	 The
scientific	 corroboration	 of	 Robin’s	 advice	 comes	 fro m	 James
Pennebaker,	 a	 Southern	 Methodist	 University	 psychol ogist,	 who	 has
shown	in	a	series	of	experiments	that	getting	people 	to	talk	about	the
thoughts	that	trouble	them	most	has	a	beneficial	medic al	effect. 44	His
method	is	remarkably	simple:	he	asks	people	to	write,	 for	fifteen	to
twenty	minutes	a	day	over	five	or	so	days,	about,	fo r	example,	“the
most	traumatic	experience	of	your	entire	life,”	or	so me	pressing	worry
of	the	moment.	What	people	write	can	be	kept	entirely 	to	themselves
if	they	like.
The	 net	 effect	 of	 this	 confessional	 is	 striking:	 en hanced	 immune
function,	significant	drops	in	health-center	visits 	in	the	following	six
months,	 fewer	 days	 missed	 from	 work,	 and	 even	 improved	 liver
enzyme	 function.	 Moreover,	 those	 whose	 writing	 showe d	 most
evidence	of	turbulent	feelings	had	the	greatest	impr ovements	in	their
immune	function.	A	specific	pattern	emerged	as	the	“he althiest”	way
to	 ventilate	 troubling	 feelings:	 at	 first	 expressin g	 a	 high	 level	 of
sadness,	 anxiety,	 anger—whatever	 troubling	 feelings	 the	 topic
brought	up;	then,	over	the	course	of	the	next	sever al	days	weaving	a
narrative,	finding	some	meaning	in	the	trauma	or	travail.
That	process,	of	course,	seems	akin	to	what	happens	 when	people
explore	such	troubles	in	psychotherapy.	Indeed,	Pen nebaker’s	findings
suggest	 one	 reason	 why	 other	 studies	 show	 medical	 pa tients	 given
psychotherapy	in	addition	to	surgery	or	medical	trea tment	often	fare
better	medically 	than	do	those	who	receive	medical	treatment	alone. 45
Perhaps	the	most	powerful	demonstration	of	the	clinic al	power	of
emotional	 support	 was	 in	 groups	 at	 Stanford	 Universi ty	 Medical
School	 for	 women	 with	 advanced	 metastatic	 breast	 canc er.	 After	 an
initial	treatment,	often	including	surgery,	these	wo men’s	cancer	had
returned	and	was	spreading	through	their	bodies.	It 	was	only	a	matter
of	time,	clinically	speaking,	until	the	spreading	cancer	kil led	them.	Dr.
David	Spiegel,	who	conducted	the	study,	was	himself	 stunned	by	the
findings,	as	was	the	medical	community:	women	with	advanced	brea st
cancer	 who	 went	 to	 weekly	 meetings	 with	 others	 survi ved	twice	as
long	as	did	women	with	the	same	disease	who	faced	it	on	their	own. 46
All	the	women	received	standard	medical	care;	the	onl y	difference
======================================== [Página 206] ========================================

was	 that	 some	 also	 went	 to	 the	 groups,	 where	 they	 we re	 able	 to
unburden	 themselves	 with	 others	 who	 understood	 what	 they	 faced
and	were	willing	to	listen	to	their	fears,	their	pa in,	and	their	anger.
Often	this	was	the	only	place	where	the	women	could	 be	open	about
these	 emotions,	 because	 other	 people	 in	 their	 lives	 dreaded	 talking
with	them	about	the	cancer	and	their	imminent	death.	W omen	who
attended	 the	 groups	 lived	 for	 thirty-seven	 addition al	 months,	 on
average,	while	those	with	the	disease	who	did	not	g o	to	the	groups
died,	 on	 average,	 in	 nineteen	 months—a	 gain	 in	 life	 e xpectancy	 for
such	 patients	 beyond	 the	 reach	 of	 any	 medication	 or	 other	 medical
treatment.	As	Dr.	Jimmie	Holland,	the	chief	psychiatric 	oncologist	at
Sloan-Kettering	Memorial	Hospital,	a	cancer	treatment	 center	in	New
York	City,	put	it	to	me,	“Every	cancer	patient	shoul d	be	in	a	group
like	 this.”	 Indeed,	 if	 it	 had	 been	 a	 new	 drug	 that	 produced	 the
extended	 life	 expectancy,	 pharmaceutical	 companies	 wo uld	 be
battling	to	produce	it.
BRINGING	EMOTIONAL	INTELLIGENCE	TO	MEDICAL	CARE
The	day	a	routine	checkup	spotted	some	blood	in	my	ur ine,	my	doctor
sent	me	for	a	diagnostic	test	in	which	I	was	injected	with	a	radi oactive
dye.	I	lay	on	a	table	while	an	overhead	X-ray	machin e	took	successive
images	 of	 the	 dye’s	 progression	 through	 my	 kidneys	 an d	 bladder.	 I
had	 company	 for	 the	 test:	 a	 close	 friend,	 a	 physicia n	 himself,
happened	 to	 be	 visiting	 for	 a	 few	 days	 and	 offered	 to	 come	 to	 the
hospital	with	me.	He	sat	in	the	room	while	the	X-ray	ma chine,	on	an
automated	track,	rotated	for	new	camera	angles,	whirr ed	and	clicked;
rotated,	whirred,	clicked.
The	test	took	an	hour	and	a	half.	At	the	very	end	a 	kidney	specialist
hurried	into	the	room,	quickly	introduced	himself,	an d	disappeared	to
scan	the	X-rays.	He	didn’t	return	to	tell	me	what	they	showed.
As	 we	 were	 leaving	 the	 exam	 room	 my	 friend	 and	 I	 passe d	 the
nephrologist.	 Feeling	 shaken	 and	 somewhat	 dazed	 by	 t he	 test,	 I	 did
not	have	the	presence	of	mind	to	ask	the	one	questio n	that	had	been
on	 my	 mind	 all	 morning.	 But	 my	 companion,	 the	 physician, 	 did:
“Doctor,”	 he	 said,	 “my	 friend’s	 father	 died	 of	 bladd er	 cancer.	 He’s
anxious	to	know	if	you	saw	any	signs	of	cancer	in	the	X-rays.”
“No	abnormalities,”	was	the	curt	reply	as	the	nephro logist	hurried
on	to	his	next	appointment.
======================================== [Página 207] ========================================

My	 inability	 to	 ask	 the	 single	 question	 I	 cared	 abo ut	 most	 is
repeated	 a	 thousand	 times	 each	 day	 in	 hospitals	 and	 clinics
everywhere.	 A	 study	 of	 patients	 in	 physicians’	 wait ing	 rooms	 found
that	each	had	an	average	of	three	or	more	questions	 in	mind	to	ask
the	physician	they	were	about	to	see.	But	when	the	 patients	left	the
physician’s	office,	an	average	of	only	one	and	a	ha lf	of	those	questions
had	 been	 answered. 47	 This	 finding	 speaks	 to	 one	 of	 the	 many	 ways
patients’	emotional	needs	are	unmet	by	today’s	medicin e.	Unanswered
questions	 feed	 uncertainty,	 fear,	 catastrophizing.	 And	 they	 lead
patients	to	balk	at	going	along	with	treatment	regime s	they	don’t	fully
understand.
There	 are	 many	 ways	 medicine	 can	 expand	 its	 view	 of	 h ealth	 to
include	 the	 emotional	 realities	 of	 illness.	 For	 one, 	 patients	 could
routinely	be	offered	fuller	information	essential	to 	the	decisions	they
must	make	about	their	own	medical	care;	some	services	n ow	offer	any
caller	a	state-of-the-art	computer	search	of	the	medi cal	literature	on
what	ails	them,	so	that	patients	can	be	more	equal	pa rtners	with	their
physicians	 in	 making	 informed	 decisions. 48	 Another	 approach	 is
programs	that,	in	a	few	minutes’	time,	teach	patients	 to	be	effective
questioners	 with	 their	 physicians,	 so	 that	 when	 the y	 have	 three
questions	in	mind	as	they	wait	for	the	doctor,	they	 will	come	out	of
the	office	with	three	answers. 49
Moments	 when	 patients	 face	 surgery	 or	 invasive	 and	 p ainful	 tests
are	fraught	with	anxiety—and	are	a	prime	opportunity	 to	deal	with
the	emotional	dimension.	Some	hospitals	have	developed 	presurgery
instruction	for	patients	that	help	them	assuage	thei r	fears	and	handle
their	 discomforts—for	 example,	 by	 teaching	 patients	 re laxation
techniques,	answering	their	questions	well	in	advan ce	of	surgery,	and
telling	 them	 several	 days	 ahead	 of	 surgery	 precisely 	 what	 they	 are
likely	to	experience	during	their	recovery.	The	res ult:	patients	recover
from	surgery	an	average	of	two	to	three	days	sooner. 50
Being	 a	 hospital	 patient	 can	 be	 a	 tremendously	 lonel y,	 helpless
experience.	 But	 some	 hospitals	 have	 begun	 to	 design	 rooms	 so	 that
family	members	can	stay	with	patients,	cooking	and	car ing	for	them
as	they	would	at	home—a	progressive	step	that,	ironic ally,	is	routine
throughout	the	Third	World. 51
Relaxation	training	can	help	patients	deal	with	some 	of	the	distress
their	 symptoms	 bring,	 as	 well	 as	 with	 the	 emotions	 tha t	 may	 be
triggering	or	exacerbating	their	symptoms.	An	exemplary	model	i s	Jon
Kabat-Zinn’s	 Stress	 Reduction	 Clinic	 at	 the	 Universi ty	 of
======================================== [Página 208] ========================================

Massachusetts	 Medical	 Center,	 which	 offers	 a	 ten-we ek	 course	 in
mindfulness	and	yoga	to	patients;	the	emphasis	is	on	 being	mindful	of
emotional	episodes	as	they	are	happening,	and	on	cul tivating	a	daily
practice	that	offers	deep	relaxation.	Hospitals	have 	made	instructional
tapes	 from	 the	 course	 available	 over	 patients’	 telev ision	 sets—a	 far
better	 emotional	 diet	 for	 the	 bedridden	 than	 the	 usu al	 fare,	 soap
operas. 52
Relaxation	and	yoga	are	also	at	the	core	of	the	inn ovative	program
for	 treating	 heart	 disease	 developed	 by	 Dr.	 Dean	 Or nish. 53	 After	 a
year	 of	 this	 program,	 which	 included	 a	 low-fat	 diet, 	 patients	 whose
heart	 disease	 was	 severe	 enough	 to	 warrant	 a	 corona ry	 bypass
actually	 reversed	 the	 buildup	 of	 artery-clogging	 pl aque.	 Ornish	 tells
me	that	relaxation	training	is	one	of	the	most	importa nt	parts	of	the
program.	 Like	 Kabat-Zinn’s,	 it	 takes	 advantage	 of	 wha t	 Dr.	 Herbert
Benson	calls	the	“relaxation	response,”	the	physiol ogical	opposite	of
the	stress	arousal	that	contributes	to	such	a	wide	 spectrum	of	medical
problems.
Finally,	there	is	the	added	medical	value	of	an	empat hic	physician
or	nurse,	attuned	to	patients,	able	to	listen	and	b e	heard.	This	means
fostering	 “relationship-centered	 care,”	 recognizing 	 that	 the
relationship	 between	 physician	 and	 patient	 is	 itsel f	 a	 factor	 of
significance.	 Such	 relationships	 would	 be	 fostered	 more	 readily	 if
medical	education	included	some	basic	tools	of	emotional	intel ligence,

TOWARD	A	MEDICINE	THAT	CARES
Such	steps	are	a	beginning.	But	for	medicine	to	enla rge	its	vision	to
embrace	 the	 impact	 of	 emotions,	 two	 large	 implications	 of	 the
scientific	findings	must	be	taken	to	heart:
1.	Helping	people	better	manage	their	upsetting	feeling s—anger,	anxiety,
depression,	pessimism,	and	loneliness—is	a	form	of	d isease	prevention .
Since	the	data	show	that	the	toxicity	of	these	emoti ons,	when	chronic,
is	 on	 a	 par	 with	 smoking	 cigarettes,	 helping	 people	 handle	 them
better	 could	 potentially	 have	 a	 medical	 payoff	 as	 gr eat	 as	 getting
heavy	 smokers	 to	 quit.	 One	 way	 to	 do	 this	 that	 could 	 have	 broad
public-health	 effects	 would	 be	 to	 impart	 most	 basic	 e motional
intelligence	 skills	 to	 children,	 so	 that	 they	 become 	 lifelong	 habits.
======================================== [Página 209] ========================================

Another	 high-payoff	 preventive	 strategy	 would	 be	 to 	 teach	 emotion
management	to	people	reaching	retirement	age,	since	emo tional	well-
being	is	one	factor	that	determines	whether	an	older 	person	declines
rapidly	 or	 thrives.	 A	 third	 target	 group	 might	 be	 so -called	 at-risk
populations—the	 very	 poor,	 single	 working	 mothers,	 re sidents	 of
high-crime	 neighborhoods,	 and	 the	 like—who	 live	 under
extraordinary	 pressure	 day	 in	 and	 day	 out,	 and	 so	 mi ght	 do	 better
medically	with	help	in	handling	the	emotional	toll	of	these	str esses.
2.	Many	patients	can	benefit	measurably	when	their	psy chological	needs
are	attended	to	along	with	their	purely	medical	one s.	While	it	is	a	step
toward	 more	 humane	 care	 when	 a	 physician	 or	 nurse	 off ers	 a
distressed	 patient	 comfort	 and	 consolation,	 more	 can	 be	 done.	 But
emotional	care	is	an	opportunity	too	often	lost	in	t he	way	medicine	is
practiced	today;	it	is	a	blind	spot	for	medicine.	De spite	mounting	data
on	the	medical	usefulness	of	attending	to	emotional	n eeds,	as	well	as
supporting	 evidence	 for	 connections	 between	 the	 bra in’s	 emotional
center	and	the	immune	system,	many	physicians	remain	ske ptical	that
their	patients’	emotions	matter	clinically,	dismissing 	the	evidence	for
this	 as	 trivial	 and	 anecdotal,	 as	 “fringe,”	 or,	 wor se,	 as	 the
exaggerations	of	a	self-promoting	few.
Though	more	and	more	patients	seek	a	more	humane	medicin e,	it	is
becoming	endangered.	Of	course,	there	remain	dedicate d	nurses	and
physicians	 who	 give	 their	 patients	 tender,	 sensitiv e	 care.	 But	 the
changing	culture	of	medicine	itself,	as	it	becomes	mor e	responsive	to
the	imperatives	of	business,	is	making	such	care	incr easingly	difficult
to	find.
On	the	other	hand,	there	may	be	a	business	advantage 	to	humane
medicine:	 treating	 emotional	 distress	 in	 patients,	 ea rly	 evidence
suggests,	can	save	money—especially	to	the	extent	tha t	it	prevents	or
delays	the	onset	of	sickness,	or	helps	patients	hea l	more	quickly.	In	a
study	 of	 elderly	 patients	 with	 hip	 fracture	 at	 Mt.	 Sinai	 School	 of
Medicine	in	New	York	City	and	at	Northwestern	Unive rsity,	patients
who	received	therapy	for	depression	in	addition	to	 normal	orthopedic
care	left	the	hospital	an	average	of	two	days	earli er;	total	savings	for
the	hundred	or	so	patients	was	$97,361	in	medical	costs. 55
Such	care	also	makes	patients	more	satisfied	with	the ir	physicians
and	medical	treatment.	In	the	emerging	medical	marketpla ce,	where
patients	 often	 have	 the	 option	 to	 choose	 between	 co mpeting	 health
======================================== [Página 210] ========================================

plans,	satisfaction	levels	will	no	doubt	enter	the	equation 	of	these	very
personal	 decisions—souring	 experiences	 can	 lead	 pati ents	 to	 go
elsewhere	for	care,	while	pleasing	ones	translate	into	loya lty.
Finally,	medical	ethics	may	demand	such	an	approach.	A n	editorial
in	the	Journal	of	the	American	Medical	Association ,	 commenting	 on	 a
report	that	depression	increases	fivefold	the	likel ihood	of	dying	after
being	 treated	 for	 a	 heart	 attack,	 notes:	 “[T]he	 cle ar	 demonstration
that	 psychological	 factors	 like	 depression	 and	 soci al	 isolation
distinguish	the	coronary	heart	disease	patients	at	 highest	risk	means	it
would	be	unethical	not	to	start	trying	to	treat	these	factors .”56
If	 the	 findings	 on	 emotions	 and	 health	 mean	 anything, 	 it	 is	 that
medical	care	that	neglects	how	people	 feel	as 	they	battle	a	chronic	or
severe	disease	is	no	longer	adequate.	It	is	time	for 	medicine	to	take
more	methodical	advantage	of	the	link	between	emotion	 and	health.
What	 is	 now	 the	 exception	 could—and	 should—be	 part	 of 	 the
mainstream,	so	that	a	more	caring	medicine	is	available 	to	us	all.	At
the	 least	 it	 would	 make	 medicine	 more	 humane.	 And,	 for	 some,	 it
could	speed	the	course	of	recovery.	“Compassion,”	as 	one	patient	put
it	 in	 an	 open	 letter	 to	 his	 surgeon,	 “is	 not	 mere	 ha nd	 holding.	 It	 is
good	medicine.” 57

The	Family	Crucible
It’s	a	low-key	family	tragedy.	Carl	and	Ann	are	showin g	their	daughter	Leslie,	just	five,
how	to	play	a	brand-new	video	game.	But	as	Leslie	sta rts	to	play,	her	parents’	overly
eager	attempts	to	“help”	her	just	seem	to	get	in	the	way .	Contradictory	orders	fly	in
every	direction.
“To	 the	 right,	 to	 the	 right—stop.	 Stop.	 Stop!”	 Ann,	 the	 mot her,	 urges,	 her	 voice
growing	more	intent	and	anxious	as	Leslie,	sucking	o n	her	lip	and	staring	wide-eyed	at
the	video	screen,	struggles	to	follow	these	directives .
“See,	 you’re	 not	 lined	 up	 …	 put	 it	 to	 the	 left!	 To	 the	 l eft!”	 Carl,	 the	 girl’s	 father,
brusquely	orders.
Meanwhile	Ann,	her	eyes	rolling	upward	in	frustration, 	yells	over	his	advice,	“Stop!
Stop!”
Leslie,	unable	to	please	either	her	father	or	her	mother,	 contorts	her	jaw	in	tension
and	blinks	as	her	eyes	fill	with	tears.
Her	parents	start	bickering,	ignoring	Leslie’s	tear s.	“She’s	not	moving	the	stick	 that
much!”	Ann	tells	Carl,	exasperated.
As	the	tears	start	rolling	down	Leslie’s	cheeks,	neit her	parent	makes	any	move	that
indicates	 they	 notice	 or	 care.	 As	 Leslie	 raises	 her	 ha nd	 to	 wipe	 her	 eyes,	 her	 father
snaps,	“Okay,	put	your	hand	back	on	the	stick	…	you	wa nna	get	ready	to	shoot.	Okay,
put	it	over!”	And	her	mother	barks,	“Okay,	move	it	just 	a	teeny	bit!”
But	by	now	Leslie	is	sobbing	softly,	alone	with	her	an guish.
At	 such	 moments	 children	 learn	 deep	 lessons.	 For	 Lesl ie	 one
conclusion	from	this	painful	exchange	might	well	be	t hat	neither	her
parents,	 nor	 anyone	 else,	 for	 that	 matter,	 cares	 abo ut	 her	 feelings. 1
When	similar	moments	are	repeated	countless	times	over	the	cours e	of
childhood	 they	 impart	 some	 of	 the	 most	 fundamental	 emoti onal
messages	 of	 a	 lifetime—lessons	 that	 can	 determine	 a	 lif e	 course.
Family	life	is	our	first	school	for	emotional	learnin g;	in	this	intimate
cauldron	 we	 learn	 how	 to	 feel	 about	 ourselves	 and	 h ow	 others	 will
react	 to	 our	 feelings;	 how	 to	 think	 about	 these	 fee lings	 and	 what
======================================== [Página 213] ========================================

choices	we	have	in	reacting;	how	to	read	and	expres s	hopes	and	fears.
This	 emotional	 schooling	 operates	 not	 just	 through	 t he	 things	 that
parents	say	and	do	directly	to	children,	but	also	i n	the	models	they
offer	 for	 handling	 their	 own	 feelings	 and	 those	 tha t	 pass	 between
husband	and	wife.	Some	parents	are	gifted	emotional	t eachers,	others
atrocious.
There	are	hundreds	of	studies	showing	that	how	pare nts	treat	their
children—whether	 with	 harsh	 discipline	 or	 empathic	 un derstanding,
with	 indifference	 or	 warmth,	 and	 so	 on—has	 deep	 and	 l asting
consequences	 for	 the	 child’s	 emotional	 life.	 Only	 re cently,	 though,
have	there	been	hard	data	showing	that	having	emotionally	int elligent
parents	 is	 itself	 of	 enormous	 benefit	 to	 a	 child.	 Th e	 ways	 a	 couple
handles	 the	 feelings	 between	 them—in	 addition	 to	 thei r	 direct
dealings	with	a	child—impart	powerful	lessons	to	thei r	children,	who
are	astute	learners,	attuned	to	the	subtlest	emotion al	exchanges	in	the
family.	When	research	teams	led	by	Carole	Hooven	and	 John	Gottman
at	the	University	of	Washington	did	a	microanalysis	 of	interactions	in
couples	on	how	the	partners	handled	their	children, 	they	found	that
those	couples	who	were	more	emotionally	competent	in	t he	marriage
were	 also	 the	 most	 effective	 in	 helping	 their	 childr en	 with	 their
emotional	ups	and	downs. 2
The	families	were	first	seen	when	one	of	their	child ren	was	just	five
years	old,	and	again	when	the	child	had	reached	nin e.	In	addition	to
observing	 the	 parents	 talk	 with	 each	 other,	 the	 res earch	 team	 also
watched	families	(including	Leslie’s)	as	the	father	 or	mother	tried	to
show	 their	 young	 child	 how	 to	 operate	 a	 new	 video	 g ame—a
seemingly	innocuous	interaction,	but	quite	telling	about	th e	emotional
currents	that	run	between	parent	and	child.
Some	 mothers	 and	 fathers	 were	 like	 Ann	 and	 Carl:	 over bearing,
losing	 patience	 with	 their	 child’s	 ineptness,	 raisi ng	 their	 voices	 in
disgust	 or	 exasperation,	 some	 even	 putting	 their	 chi ld	 down	 as
“stupid”—in	 short,	 falling	 prey	 to	 the	 same	 tendencie s	 toward
contempt	and	disgust	that	eat	away	at	a	marriage.	Oth ers,	however,
were	 patient	 with	 their	 child’s	 errors,	 helping	 the 	 child	 figure	 the
game	 out	 in	 his	 or	 her	 own	 way	 rather	 than	 imposing	 t he	 parents’
will.	The	video	game	session	was	a	surprisingly	powe rful	barometer	of
the	parents’	emotional	style.
The	three	most	common	emotionally	inept	parenting	style s	proved
to	be:
======================================== [Página 214] ========================================

•	Ignoring	feelings	altogether .	 Such	 parents	 treat	 a	 child’s	 emotional
upset	as	trivial	or	a	bother,	something	they	should	 wait	to	blow	over.
They	fail	to	use	emotional	moments	as	a	chance	to	get	 closer	to	the
child	or	to	help	the	child	learn	lessons	in	emotional	competenc e.
•	Being	too	laissez-faire .	These	parents	notice	how	a	child	feels,	but
hold	that	however	a	child	handles	the	emotional	stor m	is	fine—even,
say,	 hitting.	 Like	 those	 who	 ignore	 a	 child’s	 feeli ngs,	 these	 parents
rarely	 step	 in	 to	 try	 to	 show	 their	 child	 an	 altern ative	 emotional
response.	 They	 try	 to	 soothe	 all	 upsets,	 and	 will,	 for	 instance,	 use
bargaining	and	bribes	to	get	their	child	to	stop	being	sad	or	a ngry.
•	Being	contemptuous,	showing	no	respect	for	how	the	 child	feels .	Such
parents	are	typically	disapproving,	harsh	in	both	t heir	criticisms	and
their	punishments.	They	might,	for	instance,	forbid	a ny	display	of	the
child’s	 anger	 at	 all,	 and	 become	 punitive	 at	 the	 lea st	 sign	 of
irritability.	These	are	the	parents	who	angrily	yel l	at	a	child	who	is
trying	to	tell	his	side	of	the	story,	“Don’t	you	talk	back	to	me! ”
Finally,	 there	 are	 parents	 who	 seize	 the	 opportunit y	 of	 a	 child’s
upset	to	act	as	what	amounts	to	an	emotional	coach	or 	mentor.	They
take	 their	 child’s	 feelings	 seriously	 enough	 to	 try 	 to	 understand
exactly	what	is	upsetting	them	(“Are	you	angry	becau se	Tommy	hurt
your	 feelings?”)	 and	 to	 help	 the	 child	 find	 positiv e	 ways	 to	 soothe
their	 feelings	 (“Instead	 of	 hitting	 him,	 why	 don’t	 y ou	 find	 a	 toy	 to
play	with	on	your	own	until	you	feel	like	playing	with	him	again ?”).
In	order	for	parents	to	be	effective	coaches	in	thi s	way,	they	must
have	 a	 fairly	 good	 grasp	 of	 the	 rudiments	 of	 emotiona l	 intelligence
themselves.	 One	 of	 the	 basic	 emotional	 lessons	 for	 a	 child,	 for
example,	 is	 how	 to	 distinguish	 among	 feelings;	 a	 fath er	 who	 is	 too
tuned	out	of,	say,	his	own	sadness	cannot	help	his	 son	understand	the
difference	 between	 grieving	 over	 a	 loss,	 feeling	 sa d	 in	 a	 sad	 movie,
and	the	sadness	that	arises	when	something	bad	happe ns	to	someone
the	 child	 cares	 about.	 Beyond	 this	 distinction,	 the re	 are	 more
sophisticated	insights,	such	as	that	anger	is	so	of ten	prompted	by	first
feeling	hurt.
As	children	grow	the	specific	emotional	lessons	they 	are	ready	for—
and	in	need	of—shift.	As	we	saw	in	 Chapter	7 	the	lessons	in	empathy
begin	 in	 infancy,	 with	 parents	 who	 attune	 to	 their	 baby’s	 feelings.
Though	 some	 emotional	 skills	 are	 honed	 with	 friends	 t hrough	 the
years,	emotionally	adept	parents	can	do	much	to	help	 their	children
======================================== [Página 215] ========================================

with	 each	 of	 the	 basics	 of	 emotional	 intelligence:	 l earning	 how	 to
recognize,	 manage,	 and	 harness	 their	 feelings;	 empath izing;	 and
handling	the	feelings	that	arise	in	their	relationships.
The	 impact	 on	 children	 of	 such	 parenting	 is	 extraord inarily
sweeping. 3	 The	 University	 of	 Washington	 team	 found	 that	 when
parents	are	emotionally	adept,	compared	to	those	who	 handle	feelings
poorly,	 their	 children—understandably—get	 along	 bette r	 with,	 show
more	affection	toward,	and	have	less	tension	around	 their	parents.	But
beyond	 that,	 these	 children	 also	 are	 better	 at	 hand ling	 their	 own
emotions,	are	more	effective	at	soothing	themselves	wh en	upset,	and
get	 upset	 less	 often.	 The	 children	 are	 also	 more	 rel axed	biologically ,
with	 lower	 levels	 of	 stress	 hormones	 and	 other	 physi ological
indicators	 of	 emotional	 arousal	 (a	 pattern	 that,	 if	 sustained	 through
life,	 might	 well	 augur	 better	 physical	 health,	 as	 we 	 saw	 in	 Chapter
11).	 Other	 advantages	 are	 social:	 these	 children	 are	 more	 popular
with	and	are	better-liked	by	their	peers,	and	are	s een	by	their	teachers
as	 more	 socially	 skilled.	 Their	 parents	 and	 teachers 	 alike	 rate	 these
children	 as	 having	 fewer	 behavioral	 problems	 such	 as 	 rudeness	 or
aggressiveness.	Finally,	the	benefits	are	cognitive ;	these	children	can
pay	 attention	 better,	 and	 so	 are	 more	 effective	 lear ners.	 Holding	 IQ
constant,	 the	 five-year-olds	 whose	 parents	 were	 goo d	 coaches	 had
higher	 achievement	 scores	 in	 math	 and	 reading	 when	 th ey	 reached
third	grade	(a	powerful	argument	for	teaching	emotion al	skills	to	help
prepare	 children	 for	 learning	 as	 well	 as	 life).	 Thu s	 the	 payoff	 for
children	whose	parents	are	emotionally	adept	is	a	su rprising—almost
astounding—range	of	advantages	across,	and	beyond,	t he	spectrum	of
emotional	intelligence.
HEART	START
The	impact	of	parenting	on	emotional	competence	starts 	in	the	cradle.
Dr.	T.	Berry	Brazelton,	the	eminent	Harvard	pediatric ian,	has	a	simple
diagnostic	 test	 of	 a	 baby’s	 basic	 outlook	 toward	 li fe.	 He	 offers	 two
blocks	to	an	eight-month-old,	and	then	shows	the	bab y	how	he	wants
her	to	put	the	two	blocks	together.	A	baby	who	is	h opeful	about	life,
who	has	confidence	in	her	own	abilities,	says	Brazelton,
will	pick	up	one	block,	mouth	it,	rub	it	in	her	hair,	d rop	it	over	the	side	of	the	table,
watching	 to	 see	 whether	 you	 will	 retrieve	 it	 for	 her.	 Whe n	 you	 do,	 she	 finally
======================================== [Página 216] ========================================

completes	the	requested	task—place	the	two	blocks	toget her.	Then	she	looks	up	at	you
with	a	bright-eyed	look	of	expectancy	that	says,	“Tell	me 	how	great	I	am!”4
Babies	 like	 these	 have	 gotten	 a	 goodly	 dose	 of	 appr oval	 and
encouragement	from	the	adults	in	their	lives;	they	ex pect	to	succeed
in	 life’s	 little	 challenges.	 By	 contrast,	 babies	 wh o	 come	 from	 homes
too	bleak,	chaotic,	or	neglectful	go	about	the	same	small 	task	in	a	way
that	signals	they	already	expect	to	fail.	It	is	not 	that	these	babies	fail
to	bring	the	blocks	together;	they	understand	the	i nstruction	and	have
the	coordination	to	comply.	But	even	when	they	do,	r eports	Brazelton,
their	demeanor	is	“hangdog,”	a	look	that	says,	“I’m	n o	good.	See,	I’ve
failed.”	 Such	 children	 are	 likely	 to	 go	 through	 lif e	 with	 a	 defeatist
outlook,	 expecting	 no	 encouragement	 or	 interest	 from	 teachers,
finding	school	joyless,	perhaps	eventually	dropping	out.
The	 difference	 between	 the	 two	 outlooks—children	 who 	 are
confident	 and	 optimistic	 versus	 those	 who	 expect	 to	 fail—starts	 to
take	shape	in	the	first	few	years	of	life.	Parents, 	says	Brazelton,	“need
to	understand	how	their	actions	can	help	generate	t he	confidence,	the
curiosity,	 the	 pleasure	 in	 learning	 and	 the	 underst anding	 of	 limits”
that	help	children	succeed	in	life.	His	advice	is	in formed	by	a	growing
body	 of	 evidence	 showing	 that	 success	 in	 school	 dep ends	 to	 a
surprising	 extent	 on	 emotional	 characteristics	 formed 	 in	 the	 years
before	a	child	enters	school.	As	we	saw	in	 Chapter	6 ,	for	example,	the
ability	 of	 four-year-olds	 to	 control	 the	 impulse	 to	 grab	 for	 a
marshmallow	 predicted	 a	 210-point	 advantage	 in	 their	 SAT	 scores
fourteen	years	later.
The	 first	 opportunity	 for	 shaping	 the	 ingredients	 o f	 emotional
intelligence	is	in	the	earliest	years,	though	these	capacit ies	continue	to
form	 throughout	 the	 school	 years.	 The	 emotional	 abili ties	 children
acquire	 in	 later	 life	 build	 on	 those	 of	 the	 earlies t	 years.	 And	 these
abilities,	as	we	saw	in	 Chapter	6 ,	are	the	essential	foundation	for	all
learning.	 A	 report	 from	 the	 National	 Center	 for	 Clin ical	 Infant
Programs	 makes	 the	 point	 that	 school	 success	 is	 not	 p redicted	 by	 a
child’s	 fund	 of	 facts	 or	 a	 precocious	 ability	 to	 re ad	 so	 much	 as	 by
emotional	 and	 social	 measures:	 being	 self-assured	 and 	 interested;
knowing	 what	 kind	 of	 behavior	 is	 expected	 and	 how	 t o	 rein	 in	 the
impulse	to	misbehave;	being	able	to	wait,	to	follow	d irections,	and	to
turn	 to	 teachers	 for	 help;	 and	 expressing	 needs	 whi le	 getting	 along
with	other	children. 5
Almost	all	students	who	do	poorly	in	school,	says	th e	report,	lack
======================================== [Página 217] ========================================

one	or	more	of	these	elements	of	emotional	intelligenc e	(regardless	of
whether	 they	 also	 have	 cognitive	 difficulties	 such	 as	 learning
disabilities).	 The	 magnitude	 of	 the	 problem	 is	 not	 min or;	 in	 some
states	close	to	one	in	five	children	have	to	repeat 	first	grade,	and	then
as	 the	 years	 go	 on	 fall	 further	 behind	 their	 peers, 	 becoming
increasingly	discouraged,	resentful,	and	disruptive.
A	 child’s	 readiness	 for	 school	 depends	 on	 the	 most	 b asic	 of	 all
knowledge,	how	to	learn.	The	report	lists	the	seven	key	ingredien ts	of
this	crucial	capacity—all	related	to	emotional	intelligence :6
1.	Confidence .	 A	 sense	 of	 control	 and	 mastery	 of	 one’s	 body,
behavior,	and	world;	the	child’s	sense	that	he	is	mo re	likely	than	not
to	succeed	at	what	he	undertakes,	and	that	adults	will	be	help ful.
2.	Curiosity .	The	sense	that	finding	out	about	things	is	positi ve	and
leads	to	pleasure.
3.	Intentionality .	The	wish	and	capacity	to	have	an	impact,	and	to
act	 upon	 that	 with	 persistence.	 This	 is	 related	 to	 a	 sense	 of
competence,	of	being	effective.
4.	Self-control .	 The	 ability	 to	 modulate	 and	 control	 one’s	 own
actions	in	age-appropriate	ways;	a	sense	of	inner	control.
5.	Relatedness .	The	ability	to	engage	with	others	based	on	the	se nse
of	being	understood	by	and	understanding	others.
6.	Capacity	to	communicate .	 The	 wish	 and	 ability	 to	 verbally
exchange	ideas,	feelings,	and	concepts	with	others. 	This	is	related	to	a
sense	 of	 trust	 in	 others	 and	 of	 pleasure	 in	 engagin g	 with	 others,
including	adults.
7.	Cooperativeness .	 The	 ability	 to	 balance	 one’s	 own	 needs	 with
those	of	others	in	group	activity.
Whether	 or	 not	 a	 child	 arrives	 at	 school	 on	 the	 fir st	 day	 of
kindergarten	with	these	capabilities	depends	greatl y	on	how	much	her
parents—and	preschool	teachers—have	given	her	the	kin d	of	care	that
amounts	to	a	“Heart	Start,”	the	emotional	equivalent	of	the	Head	S tart
programs.
GETTING	THE	EMOTIONAL	BASICS
Say	a	two-month-old	baby	wakes	up	at	3	 A.M.	 and	 starts	 crying.	 Her
mother	 comes	 in	 and,	 for	 the	 next	 half	 hour,	 the	 baby 	 contentedly
======================================== [Página 218] ========================================

nurses	 in	 her	 mother’s	 arms	 while	 her	 mother	 gazes	 at	 her
affectionately,	 telling	 her	 that	 she’s	 happy	 to	 see 	 her,	 even	 in	 the
middle	 of	 the	 night.	 The	 baby,	 content	 in	 her	 mother’ s	 love,	 drifts
back	to	sleep.
Now	 say	 another	 two-month-old	 baby,	 who	 also	 awoke	 c rying	 in
the	wee	hours,	is	met	instead	by	a	mother	who	is	tens e	and	irritable,
having	 fallen	 asleep	 just	 an	 hour	 before	 after	 a	 fi ght	 with	 her
husband.	The	baby	starts	to	tense	up	the	moment	his	mo ther	abruptly
picks	 him	 up,	 telling	 him,	 “Just	 be	 quiet—I	 can’t	 stan d	 one	 more
thing!	Come	on,	let’s	get	it	over	with.”	As	the	baby 	nurses	his	mother
stares	stonily	ahead,	not	looking	at	him,	reviewing	 her	fight	with	his
father,	getting	more	 agitated	herself	as	 she	mulls	it 	 over.	The	baby,
sensing	 her	 tension,	 squirms,	 stiffens,	 and	 stops	 nu rsing.	 “That’s	 all
you	 want?”	 his	 mother	 says.	 “Then	 don’t	 eat.”	 With	 t he	 same
abruptness	she	puts	him	back	in	his	crib	and	stalks	 out,	letting	him
cry	until	he	falls	back	to	sleep,	exhausted.
The	 two	 scenarios	 are	 presented	 by	 the	 report	 from	 t he	 National
Center	 for	 Clinical	 Infant	 Programs	 as	 examples	 of	 th e	 kinds	 of
interaction	 that,	 if	 repeated	 over	 and	 over,	 instil l	 very	 different
feelings	in	a	toddler	about	himself	and	his	closest	 relationships. 7	The
first	baby	is	learning	that	people	can	be	trusted	t o	notice	her	needs
and	counted	on	to	help,	and	that	she	can	be	effecti ve	in	getting	help;
the	 second	 is	 finding	 that	 no	 one	 really	 cares,	 tha t	 people	 can’t	 be
counted	on,	and	that	his	efforts	to	get	solace	will 	meet	with	failure.	Of
course,	 most	 babies	 get	 at	 least	 a	 taste	 of	 both	 kin ds	 of	 interaction.
But	to	the	degree	that	one	or	the	other	is	typical	 of	how	parents	treat
a	child	over	the	years,	basic	emotional	lessons	will 	be	imparted	about
how	secure	a	child	is	in	the	world,	how	effective	h e	feels,	and	how
dependable	others	are.	Erik	Erikson	put	it	in	terms	 of	whether	a	child
comes	to	feel	a	“basic	trust”	or	a	basic	mistrust.
Such	 emotional	 learning	 begins	 in	 life’s	 earliest	 mome nts,	 and
continues	 throughout	 childhood.	 All	 the	 small	 exchan ges	 between
parent	and	child	have	an	emotional	subtext,	and	in	t he	repetition	of
these	 messages	 over	 the	 years	 children	 form	 the	 core	 of	 their
emotional	 outlook	 and	 capabilities.	 A	 little	 girl	 wh o	 finds	 a	 puzzle
frustrating	and	asks	her	busy	mother	to	help	gets	on e	message	if	the
reply	is	the	mother’s	clear	pleasure	at	the	request, 	and	quite	another	if
it’s	a	curt	 “Don’t	bother	me—I’ve	 got	important	work	 t o	do.”	 When
such	 encounters	 become	 typical	 of	 child	 and	 parent,	 they	 mold	 the
child’s	emotional	expectations	about	relationships,	 outlooks	that	will
======================================== [Página 219] ========================================

flavor	her	functioning	in	all	realms	of	life,	for	better	or	wor se.
The	risks	are	greatest	for	those	children	whose	par ents	are	grossly
inept—immature,	 abusing	 drugs,	 depressed	 or	 chronicall y	 angry,	 or
simply	aimless	and	living	chaotic	lives.	Such	parents 	are	far	less	likely
to	 give	 adequate	 care,	 let	 alone	 attune	 to	 their	 to ddler’s	 emotional
needs.	 Simple	 neglect,	 studies	 find,	 can	 be	 more	 damag ing	 than
outright	abuse. 8	A	survey	of	maltreated	children	found	the	neglected
youngsters	 doing	 the	 worst	 of	 all:	 they	 were	 the	 mos t	 anxious,
inattentive,	and	apathetic,	alternately	aggressive	 and	withdrawn.	The
rate	for	having	to	repeat	first	grade	among	them	was	65	percent.
The	first	three	or	four	years	of	life	are	a	period	 when	the	toddler’s
brain	grows	to	about	two	thirds	its	full	size,	and	 evolves	in	complexity
at	a	greater	rate	than	it	ever	will	again.	During	t his	period	key	kinds
of	 learning	 take	 place	 more	 readily	 than	 later	 in	 li fe—emotional
learning	 foremost	 among	 them.	 During	 this	 time	 severe	 s tress	 can
impair	 the	 brain’s	 learning	 centers	 (and	 so	 be	 damagi ng	 to	 the
intellect).	Though	as	we	shall	see,	this	can	be	reme died	to	some	extent
by	 experiences	 later	 in	 life,	 the	 impact	 of	 this	 ear ly	 learning	 is
profound.	 As	 one	 report	 sums	 up	 the	 key	 emotional	 les son	 of	 life’s
first	four	years,	the	lasting	consequences	are	great:
A	child	who	cannot	focus	his	attention,	who	is	suspiciou s	rather	than	trusting,	sad	or
angry	 rather	 than	 optimistic,	 destructive	 rather	 than	 re spectful	 and	 one	 who	 is
overcome	 with	 anxiety,	 preoccupied	 with	 frightening	 fanta sy	 and	 feels	 generally
unhappy	 about	 himself—such	 a	 child	 has	 little	 opportunity	 a t	 all,	 let	 alone	 equal
opportunity,	to	claim	the	possibilities	of	the	world	as 	his	own.9
HOW	TO	RAISE	A	BULLY
Much	 can	 be	 learned	 about	 the	 lifelong	 effects	 of	 e motionally	 inept
parenting—particularly	 its	 role	 in	 making	 children	 ag gressive—from
longitudinal	 studies	 such	 as	 one	 of	 870	 children	 fr om	 upstate	 New
York	 who	 were	 followed	 from	 the	 time	 they	 were	 eight	 until	 they
were	 thirty. 10	 The	 most	 belligerent	 among	 the	 children—those
quickest	to	start	fights	and	who	habitually	used	fo rce	to	get	their	way
—were	 the	 most	 likely	 to	 have	 dropped	 out	 of	 school	 a nd,	 by	 age
thirty,	to	have	a	record	for	crimes	of	violence.	The y	also	seemed	to	be
handing	 down	 their	 propensity	 to	 violence:	 their	 ch ildren	 were,	 in
grade	school,	just	like	the	troublemakers	their	deli nquent	parent	had
======================================== [Página 220] ========================================

been.
There	is	a	lesson	in	how	aggressiveness	is	passed	f rom	generation	to
generation.	 Any	 inherited	 propensities	 aside,	 the	 t roublemakers	 as
grownups	acted	in	a	way	that	made	family	life	a	school	for	aggres sion.
As	children,	the	troublemakers	had	parents	who	disci plined	them	with
arbitrary,	 relentless	 severity;	 as	 parents	 they	 rep eated	 the	 pattern.
This	was	true	whether	it	had	been	the	father	or	the 	mother	who	had
been	 identified	 in	 childhood	 as	 highly	 aggressive.	 Aggressive	 little
girls	grew	up	to	be	just	as	arbitrary	and	harshly	p unitive	when	they
became	 mothers	 as	 the	 aggressive	 boys	 were	 as	 fathers .	 And	 while
they	punished	their	children	with	special	severity,	they	ot herwise	took
little	interest	in	their	children’s	lives,	in	effec t	ignoring	them	much	of
the	time.	At	the	same	time	the	parents	offered	these	c hildren	a	vivid—
and	 violent—example	 of	 aggressiveness,	 a	 model	 the	 chi ldren	 took
with	them	to	school	and	to	the	playground,	and	follo wed	throughout
life.	The	parents	were	not	necessarily	mean-spirited ,	nor	did	they	fail
to	wish	the	best	for	their	children;	rather,	they	s eemed	to	be	simply
repeating	the	style	of	parenting	that	had	been	model ed	for	them	by
their	own	parents.
In	 this	 model	 for	 violence,	 these	 children	 were	 disc iplined
capriciously:	 if	 their	 parents	 were	 in	 a	 bad	 mood,	 t hey	 would	 be
severely	punished;	if	their	parents	were	in	a	good	 mood,	they	could
get	away	with	mayhem	at	home.	Thus	punishment	came	not	s o	much
because	of	what	the	child	had	done,	but	by	virtue	o f	how	the	parent
felt.	This	is	a	recipe	for	feelings	of	worthlessnes s	and	helplessness,	and
for	the	sense	that	threats	are	everywhere	and	may	st rike	at	any	time.
Seen	 in	 light	 of	 the	 home	 life	 that	 spawns	 it,	 such	 children’s
combative	 and	 defiant	 posture	 toward	 the	 world	 at	 la rge	 makes	 a
certain	sense,	unfortunate	though	it	remains.	What	i s	disheartening	is
how	early	these	dispiriting	lessons	can	be	learned, 	and	how	grim	the
costs	for	a	child’s	emotional	life	can	be.
ABUSE:	THE	EXTINCTION	OF	EMPATHY
In	 the	 rough-and-tumble	 play	 of	 the	 day-care	 center,	 Mar tin,	 just	 two	 and	 a	 half,
brushed	up	against	a	little	girl,	who,	inexplicably,	 broke	out	crying.	Martin	reached	for
her	hand,	but	as	the	sobbing	girl	moved	away,	Martin	sl apped	her	on	the	arm.
As	her	tears	continued	Martin	looked	away	and	yelled ,	“Cut	it	out!	Cut	it	out!” 	over
and	over,	each	time	faster	and	louder.
======================================== [Página 221] ========================================

When	Martin	then	made	another	attempt	to	pat	her,	again	s he	resisted.	This	time
Martin	bared	his	teeth	like	a	snarling	dog,	hissing	at 	the	sobbing	girl.
Once	more	Martin	started	patting	the	crying	girl,	but 	the	pats	on	the	back	quickly
turned	 into	 pounding,	 and	 Martin	 went	 on	 hitting	 and 	 hitting	 the	 poor	 little	 girl
despite	her	screams.
That	 disturbing	 encounter	 testifies	 to	 how	 abuse—bei ng	 beaten
repeatedly,	at	the	whim	of	a	parent’s	moods—warps	a	ch ild’s	natural
bent	toward	empathy. 11	Martin’s	bizarre,	almost	brutal	response	to	his
playmate’s	 distress	 is	 typical	 of	 children	 like	 him,	 who	 have
themselves	 been	 the	 victims	 of	 beatings	 and	 other	 phy sical	 abuse
since	their	infancy.	The	response	stands	in	stark	c ontrast	to	toddlers’
usual	 sympathetic	 entreaties	 and	 attempts	 to	 console	 a	 crying
playmate,	reviewed	in	 Chapter	7 .	Martin’s	violent	response	to	distress
at	the	day-care	center	may	well	mirror	the	lessons	he 	learned	at	home
about	 tears	 and	 anguish:	 crying	 is	 met	 at	 first	 with 	 a	 peremptory
consoling	 gesture,	 but	 if	 it	 continues,	 the	 progres sion	 is	 from	 nasty
looks	 and	 shouts,	 to	 hitting,	 to	 outright	 beating.	 Perhaps	 most
troubling,	 Martin	 already	 seems	 to	 lack	 the	 most	 primi tive	 sort	 of
empathy,	the	instinct	to	stop	aggression	against	some one	who	is	hurt.
At	two	and	a	half	he	displays	the	budding	moral	impul ses	of	a	cruel
and	sadistic	brute.
Martin’s	meanness	in	place	of	empathy	is	typical	of	o ther	children
like	 him	 who	 are	 already,	 at	 their	 tender	 age,	 scarr ed	 by	 severe
physical	and	emotional	abuse	at	home.	Martin	was	part 	of	a	group	of
nine	 such	 toddlers,	 ages	 one	 to	 three,	 witnessed	 in 	 a	 two-hour
observation	 at	 his	 day-care	 center.	 The	 abused	 todd lers	 were
compared	 with	 nine	 others	 at	 the	 day-care	 center	 fro m	 equally
impoverished,	high-stress	homes,	but	who	were	not	phy sically	abused.
The	 differences	 in	 how	 the	 two	 groups	 of	 toddlers	 r eacted	 when
another	 child	 was	 hurt	 or	 upset	 were	 stark.	 Of	 twen ty-three	 such
incidents,	 five	 of	 the	 nine	 nonabused	 toddlers	 resp onded	 to	 the
distress	of	a	child	nearby	with	concern,	sadness,	o r	empathy.	But	in
the	 twenty-seven	 instances	 where	 the	 abused	 childre n	 could	 have
done	so,	not	one	showed	the	least	concern;	instead	 they	reacted	to	a
crying	child	with	expressions	of	fear,	anger,	or,	l ike	Martin,	a	physical
attack.
One	 abused	 little	 girl,	 for	 instance,	 made	 a	 ferocio us,	 threatening
face	at	another	who	had	broken	out	into	tears.	One- year-old	Thomas,
another	of	the	abused	children,	froze	in	terror	whe n	he	heard	a	child
======================================== [Página 222] ========================================

crying	 across	 the	 room;	 he	 sat	 completely	 still,	 his	 face	 full	 of	 fear,
back	stiffly	straight,	his	tension	increasing	as	th e	crying	continued—as
though	 bracing	 for	 an	 attack	 himself.	 And	 twenty-eig ht-month-old
Kate,	 also	 abused,	 was	 almost	 sadistic:	 picking	 on	 J oey,	 a	 smaller
infant,	 she	 knocked	 him	 to	 the	 ground	 with	 her	 feet, 	 and	 as	 he	 lay
there	 looked	 tenderly	 at	 him	 and	 began	 patting	 him	 ge ntly	 on	 the
back—only	to	intensify	the	pats	into	hitting	him	hard er	and	harder,
ignoring	his	misery.	She	kept	swinging	away	at	him,	l eaning	in	to	slug
him	six	or	seven	times	more,	until	he	crawled	away.
These	children,	of	course,	treat	others	as	they	the mselves	have	been
treated.	And	the	callousness	of	these	abused	childr en	is	simply	a	more
extreme	 version	 of	 that	 seen	 in	 children	 whose	 paren ts	 are	 critical,
threatening,	and	harsh	in	their	punishments.	Such	ch ildren	also	tend
to	 lack	 concern	 when	 playmates	 get	 hurt	 or	 cry;	 they 	 seem	 to
represent	 one	 end	 of	 a	 continuum	 of	 coldness	 that	 pe aks	 with	 the
brutality	of	the	abused	children.	As	they	go	on	thr ough	life,	they	are,
as	a	group,	more	likely	to	have	cognitive	difficulti es	in	learning,	more
likely	to	be	aggressive	and	unpopular	with	their	pe ers	(small	wonder,
if	their	preschool	toughness	is	a	harbinger	of	the	 future),	more	prone
to	depression,	and,	as	adults,	more	likely	to	get	in to	trouble	with	the
law	and	commit	more	crimes	of	violence. 12
This	 failure	 of	 empathy	 is	 sometimes,	 if	 not	 often,	 re peated	 over
generations,	with	brutal	parents	having	themselves	b een	brutalized	by
their	own	parents	in	childhood. 13	It	stands	in	dramatic	contrast	to	the
empathy	 ordinarily	 displayed	 by	 children	 of	 parents	 who	 are
nurturing,	encouraging	their	toddlers	to	show	conce rn	for	others	and
to	understand	how	meanness	makes	other	children	feel. 	Lacking	such
lessons	in	empathy,	these	children	seem	not	to	learn	it	at	all.
What	 is	 perhaps	 most	 troubling	 about	 the	 abused	 todd lers	 is	 how
early	they	seem	to	have	learned	to	respond	like	minia ture	versions	of
their	 own	 abusive	 parents.	 But	 given	 the	 physical	 b eatings	 they
received	as	a	sometimes	daily	diet,	the	emotional	less ons	are	all	too
clear.	Remember	that	it	is	in	moments	when	passions	run 	high	or	a
crisis	 is	 upon	 us	 that	 the	 primitive	 proclivities	 of 	 the	 brain’s	 limbic
centers	take	on	a	more	dominant	role.	At	such	moments	t he	habits	the
emotional	brain	has	learned	over	and	over	will	domina te,	for	better	or
worse.
Seeing	 how	 the	 brain	 itself	 is	 shaped	 by	 brutality—o r	 by	 love—
suggests	 that	 childhood	 represents	 a	 special	 window 	 of	 opportunity
for	emotional	lessons.	These	battered	children	have	 had	an	early	and
======================================== [Página 223] ========================================

steady	 diet	 of	 trauma.	 Perhaps	 the	 most	 instructive	 p aradigm	 for
understanding	 the	 emotional	 learning	 such	 abused	 chi ldren	 have
undergone	is	in	seeing	how	trauma	can	leave	a	lastin g	imprint	on	the
brain—and	how	even	these	savage	imprints	can	be	mended.

Trauma	and	Emotional	Relearning
Som	Chit,	a	Cambodian	refugee,	balked	when	her	three	sons	asked 	her
to	buy	them	toy	AK-47	machine	guns.	Her	sons—ages	six, 	nine,	and
eleven—wanted	 the	 toy	 guns	 to	 play	 the	 game	 some	 of	 th e	 kids	 at
their	 school	 called	 Purdy.	 In	 the	 game,	 Purdy,	 the	 v illain,	 uses	 a
submachine	 gun	 to	 massacre	 a	 group	 of	 children,	 then	 turns	 it	 on
himself.	Sometimes,	though,	the	children	have	it	end	d ifferently:	it	is
they	who	kill	Purdy.
Purdy	was	the	macabre	reenactment	by	some	of	the	survi vors	of	the
catastrophic	 events	 of	 February	 17,	 1989,	 at	 Clevel and	 Elementary
School	in	Stockton,	California.	There,	during	the	s chool’s	late-morning
recess	 for	 first,	 second,	 and	 third	 graders,	 Patric k	 Purdy—who	 had
himself	attended	those	grades	at	Cleveland	Elementary 	some	twenty
years	 earlier—stood	 at	 the	 playground’s	 edge	 and	 fir ed	 wave	 after
wave	 of	 7.22	 mm	 bullets	 at	 the	 hundreds	 of	 children	 a t	 play.	 For
seven	minutes	Purdy	sprayed	bullets	toward	the	playg round,	then	put
a	 pistol	 to	 his	 head	 and	 shot	 himself.	 When	 the	 poli ce	 arrived	 they
found	five	children	dying,	twenty-nine	wounded.
In	ensuing	months,	the	Purdy	game	spontaneously	appea red	in	the
play	of	boys	and	girls	at	Cleveland	Elementary,	one	 of	many	signs	that
those	 seven	 minutes	 and	 their	 aftermath	 were	 seared	 i nto	 the
children’s	memory.	When	 I	visited	the	 school,	just	a	 short	bike	ride
from	 the	 neighborhood	 near	 the	 University	 of	 the	 Pac ific	 where	 I
myself	had	grown	up,	it	was	five	months	after	Purdy	h ad	turned	that
recess	into	a	nightmare.	His	presence	was	still	palp able,	even	though
the	 most	 horrific	 of	 the	 grisly	 remnants	 of	 the	 shoot ing—swarms	 of
bullet	holes,	pools	of	blood,	bits	of	flesh,	skin,	 and	scalp—were	gone
by	the	morning	after	the	shooting,	washed	away	and	painted	ove r.
By	then	the	deepest	scars	at	Cleveland	Elementary	we re	not	to	the
building	but	to	the	psyches	of	the	children	and	sta ff	there,	who	were
trying	to	carry	on	with	life	as	usual. 1	Perhaps	most	striking	was	how
the	memory	of	those	few	minutes	was	revived	again	and	 again	by	any
small	 detail	 that	 was	 similar	 in	 the	 least.	 A	 teacher 	 told	 me,	 for
======================================== [Página 225] ========================================

example,	 that	 a	 wave	 of	 fright	 swept	 through	 the	 sch ool	 with	 the
announcement	 that	 St.	 Patrick’s	 Day	 was	 coming;	 a	 numb er	 of	 the
children	somehow	got	the	idea	that	the	day	was	to	ho nor	the	killer,
Patrick	Purdy.
“Whenever	we	hear	an	ambulance	on	its	way	to	the	rest	home	down
the	 street,	 everything	 halts,”	 another	 teacher	 told 	 me.	 “The	 kids	 all
listen	 to	 see	 if	 it	 will	 stop	 here	 or	 go	 on.”	 For	 s everal	 weeks	 many
children	were	terrified	of	the	mirrors	in	the	restro oms;	a	rumor	swept
the	school	that	“Bloody	Virgin	Mary,”	some	kind	of	f antasied	monster,
lurked	there.	Weeks	after	the	shooting	a	frantic	gi rl	came	running	up
to	 the	 school’s	 principal,	 Pat	 Busher,	 yelling,	 “I	 hear	 shots!	 I	 hear
shots!”	The	sound	was	from	the	swinging	chain	on	a	tetherball	p ole.
Many	 children	 became	 hypervigilant,	 as	 though	 contin ually	 on
guard	 against	 a	 repetition	 of	 the	 terror;	 some	 boys	 and	 girls	 would
hover	at	recess	next	to	the	classroom	doors,	not	dar ing	to	venture	out
to	the	playground	where	the	killings	had	occurred.	 Others	would	only
play	 in	 small	 groups,	 posting	 a	 designated	 child	 as	 lookout.	 Many
continued	 for	 months	 to	 avoid	 the	 “evil”	 areas,	 wher e	 children	 had
died.
The	 memories	 lived	 on,	 too,	 as	 disturbing	 dreams,	 intr uding	 into
the	children’s	unguarded	minds	as	they	slept.	Apart	 from	nightmares
repeating	the	shooting	itself	in	some	way,	children	 were	flooded	with
anxiety	dreams	that	left	them	apprehensive	that	they	 too	would	die
soon.	 Some	 children	 tried	 to	 sleep	 with	 their	 eyes	 o pen	 so	 they
wouldn’t	dream.
All	of	these	reactions	are	well	known	to	psychiatri sts	as	among	the
key	symptoms	of	post-traumatic	stress	disorder,	or	PTS D.	At	the	core
of	 such	 trauma,	 says	 Dr.	 Spencer	 Eth,	 a	 child	 psychi atrist	 who
specializes	 in	 PTSD	 in	 children,	 is	 “the	 intrusive	 memory	 of	 the
central	violent	action:	the	final	blow	with	a	fist, 	the	plunge	of	a	knife,
the	 blast	 of	 a	 shotgun.	 The	 memories	 are	 intense	 perc eptual
experiences—the	 sight,	 sound,	 and	 smell	 of	 gunfire;	 t he	 screams	 or
sudden	silence	of	the	victim;	the	splash	of	blood;	the	police	s irens.”
These	 vivid,	 terrifying	 moments,	 neuroscientists	 now	 say,	 become
memories	emblazoned	in	the	emotional	circuitry.	The	symp toms	are,
in	 effect,	 signs	 of	 an	 overaroused	 amygdala	 impelling 	 the	 vivid
memories	of	a	traumatic	moment	to	continue	to	intrude	on 	awareness.
As	such,	the	traumatic	memories	become	mental	hair	trigg ers,	ready
to	sound	an	alarm	at	the	least	hint	that	the	dread	mo ment	is	about	to
happen	 once	 again.	 This	 hair-trigger	 phenomenon	 is	 a 	 hallmark	 of
======================================== [Página 226] ========================================

emotional	 trauma	 of	 all	 kinds,	 including	 suffering	 re peated	 physical
abuse	in	childhood.
Any	 traumatizing	 event	 can	 implant	 such	 trigger	 memorie s	 in	 the
amygdala:	a	fire	or	an	auto	accident,	being	in	a	nat ural	catastrophe
such	 as	 an	 earthquake	 or	 a	 hurricane,	 being	 raped	 o r	 mugged.
Hundreds	of	thousands	of	people	each	year	endure	suc h	disasters,	and
many	or	most	come	away	with	the	kind	of	emotional	wound ing	that
leaves	its	imprint	on	the	brain.
Violent	acts	are	more	pernicious	than	natural	catast rophes	such	as	a
hurricane	 because,	 unlike	 victims	 of	 a	 natural	 disas ter,	 victims	 of
violence	 feel	 themselves	 to	 have	 been	 intentionally	 selected	 as	 the
target	 of	 malevolence.	 That	 fact	 shatters	 assumptions 	 about	 the
trustworthiness	of	people	and	the	safety	of	the	int erpersonal	world,	an
assumption	natural	catastrophes	leave	untouched.	Wit hin	an	instant,
the	social	world	becomes	a	dangerous	place,	one	in	w hich	people	are
potential	threats	to	your	safety.
Human	cruelties	stamp	their	victims’	memories	with	a	temp late	that
regards	with	fear	anything	vaguely	similar	to	the	as sault	itself.	A	man
who	was	struck	on	the	back	of	his	head,	never	seein g	his	attacker,	was
so	 frightened	 afterward	 that	 he	 would	 try	 to	 walk	 d own	 the	 street
directly	in	front	of	an	old	lady	to	feel	safe	from	b eing	hit	on	the	head
again. 2	A	woman	who	was	mugged	by	a	man	who	got	on	an	elevato r
with	her	and	forced	her	out	at	knifepoint	to	an	uno ccupied	floor	was
fearful	for	weeks	of	going	into	not	just	elevators, 	but	also	the	subway
or	 any	 other	 enclosed	 space	 where	 she	 might	 feel	 tra pped;	 she	 ran
from	her	bank	when	she	saw	a	man	put	his	hand	in	his	 jacket	as	the
mugger	had	done.
The	imprint	of	horror	in	memory—and	the	resulting	hyper vigilance
—can	last	a	lifetime,	as	a	study	of	Holocaust	survivor s	found.	Close	to
fifty	 years	 after	 they	 had	 endured	 semistarvation,	 t he	 slaughter	 of
their	 loved	 ones,	 and	 constant	 terror	 in	 Nazi	 death 	 camps,	 the
haunting	 memories	 were	 still	 alive.	 A	 third	 said	 they 	 felt	 generally
fearful.	 Nearly	 three	 quarters	 said	 they	 still	 beca me	 anxious	 at
reminders	of	the	Nazi	persecution,	such	as	the	sight 	of	a	uniform,	a
knock	 at	 the	 door,	 dogs	 barking,	 or	 smoke	 rising	 fro m	 a	 chimney.
About	60	percent	said	they	thought	about	the	Holocau st	almost	daily,
even	after	a	half	century;	of	those	with	active	symp toms,	as	many	as
eight	in	ten	still	suffered	from	repeated	nightmares. 	As	one	survivor
said,	 “If	 you’ve	 been	 through	 Auschwitz	 and	 you	 don ’t	 have
nightmares,	then	you’re	not	normal.”

HORROR	FROZEN	IN	MEMORY
The	 words	 of	 a	 forty-eight-year-old	 Vietnam	 vet,	 some 	 twenty-four
years	after	enduring	a	horrifying	moment	in	a	faraway	land:
I	 can’t	 get	 the	 memories	 out	 of	 my	 mind!	 The	 images	 come	 flood ing	 back	 in	 vivid
detail,	triggered	by	the	most	inconsequential	things,	 like	a	door	slamming,	the	sight	of
an	Oriental	woman,	the	touch	of	a	bamboo	mat,	or	the	smell	 of	stir-fried	pork.	Last
night	I	went	to	bed,	was	having	a	good	sleep	for	a	chan ge.	Then	in	the	early	morning	a
storm	 front	 passed	 through	 and	 there	 was	 a	 bolt	 of	 crac kling	 thunder.	 I	 awoke
instantly,	 frozen	 in	 fear.	 I	 am	 right	 back	 in	 Vietnam,	 i n	 the	 middle	 of	 the	 monsoon
season	at	my	guard	post.	I	am	sure	I’ll	get	hit	in	the	 next	volley	and	convinced	I	will
die.	My	hands	are	freezing,	yet	sweat	pours	from	my	ent ire	body.	I	feel	each	hair	on
the	 back	 of	 my	 neck	 standing	 on	 end.	 I	 can’t	 catch	 my	 br eath	 and	 my	 heart	 is
pounding.	 I	 smell	 a	 damp	 sulfur	 smell.	 Suddenly	 I	 see	 w hat’s	 left	 of	 my	 buddy
Troy	…	on	a	bamboo	platter,	sent	back	to	our	camp	by	the 	Vietcong.…	The	next	bolt
of	lightning	and	clap	of	thunder	makes	me	jump	so	much	that	 I	fall	to	the	floor.3
This	horrible	memory,	vividly	fresh	and	detailed	thou gh	more	than
two	decades	old,	still	holds	the	power	to	induce	th e	same	fear	in	this
ex-soldier	that	he	felt	on	that	fateful	day.	PTSD	r epresents	a	perilous
lowering	of	the	neural	setpoint	for	alarm,	leaving	t he	person	to	react
to	 life’s	 ordinary	 moments	 as	 though	 they	 were	 emergen cies.	 The
hijacking	circuit	discussed	in	 Chapter	2 	seems	critical	in	leaving	such
a	 powerful	 brand	 on	 memory:	 the	 more	 brutal,	 shocking, 	 and
horrendous	the	events	that	trigger	the	amygdala	hija cking,	the	more
indelible	the	memory.	The	neural	basis	for	these	memori es	appears	to
be	a	sweeping	alteration	in	the	chemistry	of	the	brain	set	in	mot ion	by
a	 single	 instance	 of	 overwhelming	 terror. 4	 While	 the	 PTSD	 findings
are	typically	based	on	the	impact	of	a	single	episod e,	similar	results
can	come	from	cruelties	inflicted	over	a	period	of	ye ars,	as	is	the	case
with	children	who	are	sexually,	physically,	or	emotionally	a bused.
The	most	detailed	work	on	these	brain	changes	is	bei ng	done	at	the
National	 Center	 for	 Post-Traumatic	 Stress	 Disorder,	 a	 network	 of
research	sites	based	at	Veterans’	Administration	hos pitals	where	there
are	large	pools	of	those	who	suffer	from	PTSD	among	t he	veterans	of
Vietnam	and	other	wars.	It	is	from	studies	on	vets	su ch	as	these	that
most	of	our	knowledge	of	PTSD	has	come.	But	these	ins ights	apply	as
well	to	children	who	have	suffered	severe	emotional	 trauma,	such	as
those	at	Cleveland	Elementary.

“Victims	 of	 a	 devastating	 trauma	 may	 never	 be	 the	 same
biologically,”	 Dr.	 Dennis	 Charney	 told	 me. 5	 A	 Yale	 psychiatrist,
Charney	is	director	of	clinical	neuroscience	at	the 	National	Center.	“It
does	 not	 matter	 if	 it	 was	 the	 incessant	 terror	 of	 co mbat,	 torture,	 or
repeated	 abuse	 in	 childhood,	 or	 a	 one-time	 experienc e,	 like	 being
trapped	 in	 a	 hurricane	 or	 nearly	 dying	 in	 an	 auto	 a ccident.	 All
uncontrollable	stress	can	have	the	same	biological	impact.”
The	 operative	 word	 is	 uncontrollable .	 If	 people	 feel	 there	 is
something	they	can	do	in	a	catastrophic	situation,	s ome	control	they
can	exert,	no	matter	how	minor,	they	fare	far	better	 emotionally	than
do	those	who	feel	utterly	helpless.	The	element	of	h elplessness	is	what
makes	a	given	event	 subjectively 	overwhelming.	As	Dr.	John	Krystal,
director	 of	 the	 center’s	 Laboratory	 of	 Clinical	 Psy chopharmacology,
told	 me,	 “Say	 someone	 being	 attacked	 with	 a	 knife	 kno ws	 how	 to
defend	 himself	 and	 takes	 action,	 while	 another	 perso n	 in	 the	 same
predicament	 thinks,	 ‘I’m	 dead.’	 The	 helpless	 person	 i s	 the	 one	 more
susceptible	 to	 PTSD	 afterward.	 It’s	 the	 feeling	 tha t	 your	 life	 is	 in
danger	and	there’s	nothing	you	can	do	to	escape	it —that’s	the	moment
the	brain	change	begins.”
Helplessness	as	the	wild	card	in	triggering	PTSD	ha s	been	shown	in
dozens	of	studies	on	pairs	of	laboratory	rats,	each 	in	a	different	cage,
each	being	given	mild—but,	to	a	rat,	very	stressful—el ectric	shocks	of
identical	severity.	Only	one	rat	has	a	lever	in	its 	cage;	when	the	rat
pushes	the	lever,	the	shock	stops	for	both	cages.	O ver	days	and	weeks,
both	rats	get	precisely	the	same	amount	of	shock.	But 	the	rat	with	the
power	to	turn	the	shocks	off	comes	through	without	l asting	signs	of
stress.	It	is	only	in	the	helpless	one	of	the	pair	 that	the	stress-induced
brain	 changes	 occur. 6	 For	 a	 child	 being	 shot	 at	 on	 a	 playground,
seeing	 his	 playmates	 bleeding	 and	 dying—or	 for	 a	 teac her	 there,
unable	 to	 stop	 the	 carnage—that	 helplessness	 must	 hav e	 been
palpable.
PTSD	AS	A	LIMBIC	DISORDER
It	had	been	months	since	a	huge	earthquake	shook	her 	out	of	bed	and
sent	her	yelling	in	panic	through	the	darkened	hous e	to	find	her	four-
year-old	 son.	 They	 huddled	 for	 hours	 in	 the	 Los	 Ang eles	 night	 cold
under	 a	 protective	 doorway,	 pinned	 there	 without	 fo od,	 water,	 or
light	 while	 wave	 after	 wave	 of	 aftershocks	 tumbled	 t he	 ground
======================================== [Página 229] ========================================

beneath	them.	Now,	months	later,	she	had	largely	reco vered	from	the
ready	panic	that	gripped	her	for	the	first	few	days 	afterward,	when	a
door	slamming	could	start	her	shivering	with	fear.	Th e	one	lingering
symptom	 was	 her	 inability	 to	 sleep,	 a	 problem	 that	 str uck	 only	 on
those	nights	her	husband	was	away—as	he	had	been	the 	night	of	the
quake.
The	main	symptoms	of	such	learned	fearfulness—including	the	most
intense	 kind,	 PTSD—can	 be	 accounted	 for	 by	 changes	 i n	 the	 limbic
circuitry	focusing	on	the	amygdala. 7	Some	of	the	key	changes	are	in
the	locus	ceruleus,	a	structure	that	regulates	the	 brain’s	secretion	of
two	 substances	 called	 catecholamines: 	 adrenaline	 and	 noradrenaline.
These	neurochemicals	mobilize	the	body	for	an	emergenc y;	the	same
catecholamine	surge	stamps	memories	with	special	streng th.	In	PTSD
this	 system	 becomes	 hyperreactive,	 secreting	 extra-la rge	 doses	 of
these	brain	chemicals	in	response	to	situations	that 	hold	little	or	no
threat	 but	 somehow	 are	 reminders	 of	 the	 original	 trau ma,	 like	 the
children	 at	 Cleveland	 Elementary	 School	 who	 panicked 	 when	 they
heard	 an	 ambulance	 siren	 similar	 to	 those	 they	 had	 he ard	 at	 their
school	after	the	shooting.
The	locus	ceruleus	and	the	amygdala	are	closely	link ed,	along	with
other	 limbic	 structures	 such	 as	 the	 hippocampus	 and	 h ypothalamus;
the	circuitry	for	the	catecholamines	extends	into	th e	cortex.	Changes
in	 these	 circuits	 are	 thought	 to	 underlie	 PTSD	 sympt oms,	 which
include	anxiety,	fear,	hypervigilance,	being	easily 	upset	and	aroused,
readiness	 for	 fight	 or	 flight,	 and	 the	 indelible	 en coding	 of	 intense
emotional	memories. 8	Vietnam	vets	with	PTSD,	one	study	found,	had
40	 percent	 fewer	 catecholamine-stopping	 receptors	 th an	 did	 men
without	the	symptoms—suggesting	that	their	brains	had	 undergone	a
lasting	change,	with	their	catecholamine	secretion	poorly	c ontrolled. 9
Other	changes	occur	in	the	circuit	linking	the	limbi c	brain	with	the
pituitary	 gland,	 which	 regulates	 release	 of	 CRF,	 th e	 main	 stress
hormone	the	body	secretes	to	mobilize	the	emergency	fi ght-or-flight
response.	 The	 changes	 lead	 this	 hormone	 to	 be	 overse creted—
particularly	 in	 the	 amygdala,	 hippocampus,	 and	 locus	 ceruleus—
alerting	the	body	for	an	emergency	that	is	not	there	in	reality .10
As	 Dr.	 Charles	 Nemeroff,	 a	 Duke	 University	 psychiatr ist,	 told	 me,
“Too	 much	 CRF	 makes	 you	 overreact.	 For	 example,	 if	 you ’re	 a
Vietnam	vet	with	PTSD	and	a	car	backfires	at	the	mall 	parking	lot,	it
is	the	triggering	of	CRF	that	floods	you	with	the	s ame	feelings	as	in
the	original	trauma:	you	start	sweating,	you’re	scar ed,	you	have	chills
======================================== [Página 230] ========================================

and	the	shakes,	you	may	have	flashbacks.	In	people	w ho	hypersecrete
CRF,	the	startle	response	is	overactive.	For	example ,	if	you	sneak	up
behind	 most	 people	 and	 suddenly	 clap	 your	 hands,	 you ’ll	 see	 a
startled	jump	the	first	time,	but	not	by	the	third	or 	fourth	repetition.
But	 people	 with	 too	 much	 CRF	 don’t	 habituate:	 they’l l	 respond	 as
much	to	the	fourth	clap	as	to	the	first.” 11
A	 third	 set	 of	 changes	 occurs	 in	 the	 brain’s	 opioid 	 system,	 which
secretes	 endorphins	 to	 blunt	 the	 feeling	 of	 pain.	 I t	 also	 becomes
hyperactive.	This	neural	circuit	again	involves	the 	amygdala,	this	time
in	concert	with	a	region	in	the	cerebral	cortex.	Th e	opioids	are	brain
chemicals	 that	 are	 powerful	 numbing	 agents,	 like	 opiu m	 and	 other
narcotics	that	are	chemical	cousins.	When	experienci ng	high	levels	of
opioids	 (“the	 brain’s	 own	 morphine”),	 people	 have	 a	 heightened
tolerance	 for	 pain—an	 effect	 that	 has	 been	 noted	 by	 battlefield
surgeons,	who	found	severely	wounded	soldiers	neede d	lower	doses	of
narcotics	to	handle	their	pain	than	did	civilians	w ith	far	less	serious
injuries.
Something	 similar	 seems	 to	 occur	 in	 PTSD. 12	 Endorphin	 changes
add	 a	 new	 dimension	 to	 the	 neural	 mix	 triggered	 by	 re exposure	 to
trauma:	a	numbing 	of	certain	feelings.	This	appears	to	explain	a	set 	of
“negative”	 psychological	 symptoms	 long	 noted	 in	 PTSD: 	 anhedonia
(the	inability	to	feel	pleasure)	and	a	general	emoti onal	numbness,	a
sense	of	being	cut	off	from	life	or	from	concern	abou t	others’	feelings.
Those	close	to	such	people	may	experience	this	indif ference	as	a	lack
of	empathy.	Another	possible	effect	may	be	dissociati on,	including	the
inability	 to	 remember	 crucial	 minutes,	 hours,	 or	 even	 days	 of	 the
traumatic	event.
The	 neural	 changes	 of	 PTSD	 also	 seem	 to	 make	 a	 person 	 more
susceptible	to	further	traumatizing.	A	number	of	stud ies	with	animals
have	 found	 that	 when	 they	 were	 exposed	 even	 to	 mild	 stress	 when
young,	 they	 were	 far	 more	 vulnerable	 than	 unstressed 	 animals	 to
trauma-induced	brain	changes	later	in	life	(suggesti ng	the	urgent	need
to	treat	children	with	PTSD).	This	seems	a	reason	th at,	exposed	to	the
same	catastrophe,	one	person	goes	on	to	develop	PTSD 	and	another
does	 not:	 the	 amygdala	 is	 primed	 to	 find	 danger,	 and	 when	 life
presents	 it	 once	 again	 with	 real	 danger,	 its	 alarm	 r ises	 to	 a	 higher
pitch.
All	 these	 neural	 changes	 offer	 short-term	 advantages 	 for	 dealing
with	the	grim	and	dire	emergencies	that	prompt	them.	Un der	duress,
it	 is	 adaptive	 to	 be	 highly	 vigilant,	 aroused,	 read y	 for	 anything,
======================================== [Página 231] ========================================

impervious	to	pain,	the	body	primed	for	sustained	phy sical	demands,
and—for	 the	 moment—indifferent	 to	 what	 might	 otherwise	 b e
intensely	 disturbing	 events.	 These	 short-term	 advant ages,	 however,
become	lasting	problems	when	the	brain	changes	so	tha t	they	become
predispositions,	 like	 a	 car	 stuck	 in	 perpetual	 high 	 gear.	 When	 the
amygdala	 and	 its	 connected	 brain	 regions	 take	 on	 a	 n ew	 setpoint
during	a	moment	of	intense	trauma,	this	change	in	exci tability—this
heightened	readiness	to	trigger	a	neural	hijacking—me ans	all	of	life	is
on	 the	 verge	 of	 becoming	 an	 emergency,	 and	 even	 an	 in nocent
moment	is	susceptible	to	an	explosion	of	fear	run	amok.
EMOTIONAL	RELEARNING
Such	traumatic	memories	seem	to	remain	as	fixtures	in	br ain	function
because	 they	 interfere	 with	 subsequent	 learning—spec ifically,	 with
relearning	 a	 more	 normal	 response	 to	 those	 traumatizin g	 events.	 In
acquired	fear	such	as	PTSD,	the	mechanisms	of	learnin g	and	memory
have	gone	awry;	again,	it	is	the	amygdala	that	is	ke y	among	the	brain
regions	involved.	But	in	overcoming	the	learned	fear ,	the	neocortex	is
critical.
Fear	conditioning 	 is	 the	 name	 psychologists	 use	 for	 the	 process
whereby	 something	 that	 is	 not	 in	 the	 least	 threateni ng	 becomes
dreaded	 as	 it	 is	 associated	 in	 someone’s	 mind	 with	 so mething
frightening.	 When	 such	 frights	 are	 induced	 in	 labor atory	 animals,
Charney	 notes,	 the	 fears	 can	 last	 for	 years. 13	 The	 key	 region	 of	 the
brain	 that	 learns,	 retains,	 and	 acts	 on	 this	 fearfu l	 response	 is	 the
circuit	 between	 the	 thalamus,	 amygdala,	 and	 prefronta l	 lobe—the
pathway	of	neural	hijacking.
Ordinarily,	 when	 someone	 learns	 to	 be	 frightened	 by	 something
through	fear	conditioning,	the	fear	subsides	with	t ime.	This	seems	to
happen	 through	 a	 natural	 relearning,	 as	 the	 feared	 object	 is
encountered	again	in	the	absence	of	anything	truly	 scary.	Thus	a	child
who	 acquires	 a	 fear	 of	 dogs	 because	 of	 being	 chased 	 by	 a	 snarling
German	shepherd	gradually	and	naturally	loses	that	f ear	if,	say,	she
moves	 next	 door	 to	 someone	 who	 owns	 a	 friendly	 shephe rd,	 and
spends	time	playing	with	the	dog.
In	 PTSD	 spontaneous	 relearning	 fails	 to	 occur.	 Char ney	 proposes
that	 this	 may	 be	 due	 to	 the	 brain	 changes	 of	 PTSD,	 w hich	 are	 so
strong	 that,	 in	 effect,	 the	 amygdala	 hijacking	 occur s	 every	 time
======================================== [Página 232] ========================================

something	 even	 vaguely	 reminiscent	 of	 the	 original	 tr auma	 comes
along,	strengthening	the	fear	pathway.	This	means	th at	there	is	never
a	 time	 when	 what	 is	 feared	 is	 paired	 with	 a	 feeling	 of	 calm—the
amygdala	 never	 relearns	 a	 more	 mild	 reaction.	 “Extinct ion”	 of	 the
fear,	 he	 observes,	 “appears	 to	 involve	 an	 active	 le arning	 process,”
which	 is	 itself	 impaired	 in	 people	 with	 PTSD,	 “leadi ng	 to	 the
abnormal	persistence	of	emotional	memories.” 14
But	 given	 the	 right	 experiences,	 even	 PTSD	 can	 lift ;	 strong
emotional	 memories,	 and	 the	 patterns	 of	 thought	 and	 re action	 that
they	trigger,	can	change	with	time.	This	relearning,	Charney	proposes ,
is	 cortical.	 The	 original	 fear	 ingrained	 in	 the	 amyg dala	 does	 not	 go
away	completely;	rather,	the	prefrontal	cortex	activ ely	suppresses	the
amygdala’s	command	to	the	rest	of	the	brain	to	respond	with	fear.
“The	question	is,	how	quickly	do	you	let	go	of	lear ned	fear?”	asks
Richard	 Davidson,	 the	 University	 of	 Wisconsin	 psych ologist	 who
discovered	 the	 role	 of	 the	 left	 prefrontal	 cortex	 a s	 a	 damper	 on
distress.	In	a	laboratory	experiment	in	which	people 	first	learned	an
aversion	to	a	loud	noise—a	paradigm	for	learned	fear, 	and	a	lower-
key	 parallel	 of	 PTSD—Davidson	 found	 that	 people	 who	 had	 more
activity	in	the	left	prefrontal	cortex	got	over	the 	acquired	fear	more
quickly,	 again	 suggesting	 a	 cortical	 role	 in	 lettin g	 go	 of	 learned
distress. 15
REEDUCATING	THE	EMOTIONAL	BRAIN
One	of	the	more	encouraging	findings	about	PTSD	came	 from	a	study
of	Holocaust	survivors,	about	three	quarters	of	whom	 were	found	to
have	 active	 PTSD	 symptoms	 even	 a	 half	 century	 later.	 The	 positive
finding	 was	 that	 a	 quarter	 of	 the	 survivors	 who	 onc e	 had	 been
troubled	by	such	symptoms	no	longer	had	them;	somehow	t he	natural
events	 of	 their	 lives	 had	 counteracted	 the	 problem.	 Those	 who	 still
had	 the	 symptoms	 showed	 evidence	 of	 the	 catecholamine- related
brain	changes	typical	of	PTSD—but	those	who	had	reco vered	had	no
such	changes. 16	This	finding,	and	others	like	it,	hold	out	the	pro mise
that	the	brain	changes	in	PTSD	are	not	indelible,	a nd	that	people	can
recover	from	even	the	most	dire	emotional	imprinting—in	 short,	that
the	 emotional	 circuitry	 can	 be	 reeducated.	 The	 good	 news,	 then,	 is
that	traumas	as	profound	as	those	causing	PTSD	can	h eal,	and	that	the
route	to	such	healing	is	through	relearning.
======================================== [Página 233] ========================================

One	way	this	emotional	healing	seems	to	occur	spontan eously—at
least	 in	 children—is	 through	 such	 games	 as	 Purdy.	 The se	 games,
played	 over	 and	 over	 again,	 let	 children	 relive	 a	 t rauma	 safely,	 as
play.	 This	 allows	 two	 avenues	 for	 healing:	 on	 the	 o ne	 hand,	 the
memory	 repeats	 in	 a	 context	 of	 low	 anxiety,	 desensiti zing	 it	 and
allowing	a	nontraumatized	set	of	responses	to	become	 associated	with
it.	 Another	 route	 to	 healing	 is	 that,	 in	 their	 minds ,	 children	 can
magically	 give	 the	 tragedy	 another,	 better	 outcome:	 s ometimes	 in
playing	Purdy,	the	children	kill	him,	boosting	their 	sense	of	mastery
over	that	traumatic	moment	of	helplessness.
Games	 like	 Purdy	 are	 predictable	 in	 younger	 children 	 who	 have
been	through	such	overwhelming	violence.	These	macabr e	games	in
traumatized	 children	 were	 first	 noted	 by	 Dr.	 Lenore	 Terr,	 a	 child
psychiatrist	in	San	Francisco. 17	She	found	such	games	among	children
in	Chowchilla,	California—just	a	little	over	an	hour 	down	the	Central
Valley	 from	 Stockton,	 where	 Purdy	 wreaked	 such	 havoc —who	 in
1973	 had	 been	 kidnapped	 as	 they	 rode	 a	 bus	 home	 from	 a	 summer
day	 camp.	 The	 kidnappers	 buried	 the	 bus,	 children	 an d	 all,	 in	 an
ordeal	that	lasted	twenty-seven	hours.
Five	years	later	Terr	found	the	kidnapping	still	be ing	reenacted	in
the	 victims’	 games.	 Girls,	 for	 example,	 played	 symbolic 	 kidnapping
games	with	their	Barbie	dolls.	One	girl,	who	had	hat ed	the	feeling	of
other	 children’s	 urine	 on	 her	 skin	 as	 they	 lay	 hudd led	 together	 in
terror,	 washed	 her	 Barbie	 over	 and	 over	 again.	 Anot her	 played
Traveling	 Barbie,	 in	 which	 Barbie	 travels	 somewhere—i t	 doesn’t
matter	where—and	returns	safely,	which	is	the	point	o f	the	game.	A
third	girl’s	favorite	was	a	scenario	in	which	the	d oll	is	stuck	in	a	hole
and	suffocates.
While	 adults	 who	 have	 been	 through	 overwhelming	 trau ma	 can
suffer	 a	 psychic	 numbing,	 blocking	 out	 memory	 of	 or	 fe eling	 about
the	 catastrophe,	 children’s	 psyches	 often	 handle	 it 	 differently.	 They
less	often	become	numb	to	the	trauma,	Terr	believes,	because	the y	use
fantasy,	play,	and	daydreams	to	recall	and	rethink	t heir	ordeals.	Such
voluntary	replays	of	trauma	seem	to	head	off	the	need 	for	damming
them	 up	 in	 potent	 memories	 that	 can	 later	 burst	 throug h	 as
flashbacks.	If	the	trauma	is	minor,	such	as	going	to	 the	dentist	for	a
filling,	just	once	or	twice	may	be	enough.	But	if	it ’s	overwhelming,	a
child	 needs	 endless	 repetitions,	 replaying	 the	 trau ma	 over	 and	 over
again	in	a	grim,	monotonous	ritual.
One	way	to	get	at	the	picture	frozen	in	the	amygdala 	is	through	art,
======================================== [Página 234] ========================================

which	itself	is	a	medium	of	the	unconscious.	The	emoti onal	brain	is
highly	 attuned	 to	 symbolic	 meanings	 and	 to	 the	 mode	 Fr eud	 called
the	 “primary	 process”:	 the	 messages	 of	 metaphor,	 story ,	 myth,	 the
arts.	 This	 avenue	 is	 often	 used	 in	 treating	 traumati zed	 children.
Sometimes	art	can	open	the	way	for	children	to	talk	a bout	a	moment
of	horror	that	they	would	not	dare	speak	of	otherwise.
Spencer	 Eth,	 the	 Los	 Angeles	 child	 psychiatrist	 who 	 specializes	 in
treating	 such	 children,	 tells	 of	 a	 five-year-old	 bo y	 who	 had	 been
kidnapped	with	his	mother	by	her	ex-lover.	The	man	br ought	them	to
a	motel	room,	where	he	ordered	the	boy	to	hide	under	a	blanket	whi le
he	beat	the	mother	to	death.	The	boy	was,	understand ably,	reluctant
to	 talk	 with	 Eth	 about	 the	 mayhem	 he	 had	 heard	 and	 se en	 while
underneath	 the	 blanket.	 So	 Eth	 asked	 him	 to	 draw	 a	 p icture—any
picture.
The	drawing	was	of	a	race-car	driver	who	had	a	strikingly	larg e	pair
of	eyes,	Eth	recalls.	The	huge	eyes	Eth	took	to	ref er	to	the	boy’s	own
daring	 in	 peeking	 at	 the	 killer.	 Such	 hidden	 refere nces	 to	 the
traumatic	scene	almost	always	appear	in	the	artwork	o f	traumatized
children;	 Eth	 has	 made	 having	 such	 children	 draw	 a	 p icture	 the
opening	gambit	in	therapy.	The	potent	memories	that	pr eoccupy	them
intrude	in	their	art	just	as	in	their	thoughts.	Bey ond	that,	the	act	of
drawing	is	itself	therapeutic,	beginning	the	proces s	of	mastering	the
trauma.
EMOTIONAL	RELEARNING	AND	RECOVERY	FROM	TRAUMA
Irene	had	gone	on	a	date	that	ended	in	attempted	rape. 	Though	she	had	fought	off	the
attacker,	he	continued	to	plague	her:	harassing	her	wit h	obscene	phone	calls,	making
threats	of	violence,	calling	in	the	middle	of	the	night,	 stalking	her	and	watching	her
every	move.	Once,	when	she	tried	to	get	the	police	to	he lp,	they	dismissed	her	problem
as	trivial,	since	“nothing	had	really	happened.”	By	the 	time	she	came	for	therapy	Irene
had	symptoms	of	PTSD,	had	given	up	socializing	at	all,	an d	felt	a	prisoner	in	her	own
house.
Irene’s	 case	 is	 cited	 by	 Dr.	 Judith	 Lewis	 Herman,	 a	 Harvard
psychiatrist	whose	groundbreaking	work	outlines	the	steps 	to	recovery
from	 trauma.	 Herman	 sees	 three	 stages:	 attaining	 a	 sen se	 of	 safety,
remembering	the	details	of	the	trauma	and	mourning	the	 loss	it	has
brought,	and	finally	reestablishing	a	normal	life.	T here	is	a	biological
======================================== [Página 235] ========================================

logic	 to	 the	 ordering	 of	 these	 steps,	 as	 we	 shall	 s ee:	 this	 sequence
seems	to	reflect	how	the	emotional	brain	learns	once	 again	that	life
need	not	be	regarded	as	an	emergency	about	to	happen.
The	first	step,	regaining	a	sense	of	safety,	presuma bly	translates	to
finding	 ways	 to	 calm	 the	 too-fearful,	 too	 easily	 tri ggered	 emotional
circuits	enough	to	allow	relearning. 18	Often	this	begins	with	helping
patients	 understand	 that	 their	 jumpiness	 and	 nightmar es,
hypervigilance	 and	 panics,	 are	 part	 of	 the	 symptoms	 o f	 PTSD.	 This
understanding	makes	the	symptoms	themselves	less	frightening.
Another	early	step	is	to	help	patients	regain	some	s ense	of	control
over	what	is	happening	to	them,	a	direct	unlearning	 of	the	lesson	of
helplessness	 that	 the	 trauma	 itself	 imparted.	 Irene,	 for	 example,
mobilized	her	friends	and	family	to	form	a	buffer	betw een	her	and	her
stalker,	and	was	able	to	get	the	police	to	intervene.
The	sense	in	which	PTSD	patients	feel	“unsafe”	goes 	beyond	fears
that	 dangers	 lurk	 around	 them;	 their	 insecurity	 begi ns	 more
intimately,	 in	 the	 feeling	 that	 they	 have	 no	 control 	 over	 what	 is
happening	in	their	body	and	to	their	emotions.	This	is	underst andable,
given	 the	 hair	 trigger	 for	 emotional	 hijacking	 that	 PTSD	 creates	 by
hypersensitizing	the	amygdala	circuitry.
Medication	offers	one	way	to	restore	patients’	sens e	that	they	need
not	be	so	at	the	mercy	of	the	emotional	alarms	that	fl ood	them	with
inexplicable	anxiety,	keep	them	sleepless,	or	pepper 	their	sleep	with
nightmares.	Pharmacologists	are	hoping	one	day	to	tai lor	medications
that	 will	 target	 precisely	 the	 effects	 of	 PTSD	 on	 t he	 amygdala	 and
connected	 neurotransmitter	 circuits.	 For	 now,	 though ,	 there	 are
medications	 that	 counter	 only	 some	 of	 these	 changes,	 notably	 the
antidepressants	 that	 act	 on	 the	 serotonin	 system,	 an d	 beta-blockers
like	 propranolol,	 which	 block	 the	 activation	 of	 the 	 sympathetic
nervous	 system.	 Patients	 also	 may	 learn	 relaxation	 te chniques	 that
give	 them	 the	 ability	 to	 counter	 their	 edginess	 and	 nervousness.	 A
physiological	 calm	 opens	 a	 window	 for	 helping	 the	 br utalized
emotional	circuitry	rediscover	that	life	is	not	a	th reat	and	for	giving
back	to	patients	some	of	the	sense	of	security	they	 had	in	their	lives
before	the	trauma	happened.
Another	 step	 in	 healing	 involves	 retelling	 and	 reco nstructing	 the
story	 of	 the	 trauma	 in	 the	 harbor	 of	 that	 safety,	 al lowing	 the
emotional	circuitry	to	acquire	a	new,	more	realistic	 understanding	of
and	 response	 to	 the	 traumatic	 memory	 and	 its	 triggers. 	 As	 patients
retell	 the	 horrific	 details	 of	 the	 trauma,	 the	 memory	 starts	 to	 be
======================================== [Página 236] ========================================

transformed,	both	in	its	emotional	meaning	and	in	its	 effects	on	the
emotional	 brain.	 The	 pace	 of	 this	 retelling	 is	 delic ate;	 ideally	 it
mimics	the	pace	that	occurs	naturally	in	those	people 	who	are	able	to
recover	 from	 trauma	 without	 suffering	 PTSD.	 In	 these	 cases	 there
often	 seems	 to	 be	 an	 inner	 clock	 that	 “doses”	 people 	 with	 intrusive
memories	that	relive	the	trauma,	intercut	with	weeks	o r	months	when
they	remember	hardly	anything	of	the	horrible	events. 19
This	 alternation	 of	 reimmersion	 and	 respite	 seems	 to	 a llow	 for	 a
spontaneous	 review	 of	 the	 trauma	 and	 relearning	 of	 e motional
response	 to	 it.	 For	 those	 whose	 PTSD	 is	 more	 intract able,	 says
Herman,	 retelling	 their	 tale	 can	 sometimes	 trigger	 over whelming
fears,	 in	 which	 case	 the	 therapist	 should	 ease	 the	 pace	 to	 keep	 the
patient’s	reactions	within	a	bearable	range,	one	th at	will	not	disrupt
the	relearning.
The	therapist	encourages	the	patient	to	retell	the	 traumatic	events
as	 vividly	 as	 possible,	 like	 a	 horror	 home	 video,	 re trieving	 every
sordid	 detail.	 This	 includes	 not	 just	 the	 specifics 	 of	 what	 they	 saw,
heard,	smelled,	and	felt,	but	also	their	reactions—th e	dread,	disgust,
nausea.	The	goal	here	is	to	put	the	entire	memory	int o	words,	which
means	capturing	parts	of	the	memory	that	may	have	been	 dissociated
and	so	are	absent	from	conscious	recall.	By	putting	sensory	de tails	and
feelings	 into	 words,	 presumably	 memories	 are	 brought	 mo re	 under
control	 of	 the	 neocortex,	 where	 the	 reactions	 they	 kindle	 can	 be
rendered	 more	 understandable	 and	 so	 more	 manageable.	 T he
emotional	 relearning	 at	 this	 point	 is	 largely	 accompl ished	 through
reliving	the	events	and	their	emotions,	but	this	time 	in	surroundings
of	 safety	 and	 security,	 in	 the	 company	 of	 a	 trusted	 therapist.	 This
begins	 to	 impart	 a	 telling	 lesson	 to	 the	 emotional	 ci rcuitry—that
security,	rather	than	unremitting	terror,	can	be	exp erienced	in	tandem
with	the	trauma	memories.
The	 five-year-old	 who	 drew	 the	 picture	 of	 the	 giant 	 eyes	 after	 he
witnessed	 the	 grisly	 murder	 of	 his	 mother	 did	 not	 make 	 any	 more
drawings	after	that	first	one;	instead	he	and	his	t herapist,	Spencer	Eth,
played	games,	creating	a	bond	of	rapport.	Only	slowl y	did	he	begin	to
retell	the	story	of	the	murder,	at	first	in	a	stereo typed	way,	reciting
each	 detail	 exactly	 the	 same	 in	 each	 telling.	 Gradua lly,	 though,	 his
narrative	became	more	open	and	free-flowing,	his	body 	less	tense	as
he	 told	 it.	 At	 the	 same	 time	 his	 nightmares	 of	 the	 sce ne	 came	 less
often,	 an	 indication,	 says	 Eth,	 of	 some	 “trauma	 master y.”	 Gradually
their	talk	moved	away	from	the	fears	left	by	the	trau ma	to	more	of
======================================== [Página 237] ========================================

what	was	happening	in	the	boy’s	day-to-day	life	as	 he	adjusted	to	a
new	home	with	his	father.	And	finally	the	boy	was	ab le	to	talk	just
about	his	daily	life	as	the	hold	of	the	trauma	faded.
Finally,	 Herman	 finds	 that	 patients	 need	 to	 mourn	 the	 loss	 the
trauma	 brought—whether	 an	 injury,	 the	 death	 of	 a	 love d	 one	 or	 a
rupture	 in	 a	 relationship,	 regret	 over	 some	 step	 not 	 taken	 to	 save
someone,	 or	 just	 the	 shattering	 of	 confidence	 that	 p eople	 can	 be
trusted.	The	mourning	that	ensues	while	retelling	su ch	painful	events
serves	a	crucial	purpose:	it	marks	the	ability	to	le t	go	of	the	trauma
itself	 to	 some	 degree.	 It	 means	 that	 instead	 of	 bein g	 perpetually
captured	by	this	moment	in	the	past,	patients	can	sta rt	to	look	ahead,
even	to	hope,	and	to	rebuild	a	new	life	free	of	the 	trauma’s	grip.	It	is
as	if	the	constant	recycling	and	reliving	of	the	tr auma’s	terror	by	the
emotional	 circuitry	 were	 a	 spell	 that	 could	 finally	 be	 lifted.	 Every
siren	need	not	bring	a	flood	of	fear;	every	sound	i n	the	night	need	not
compel	a	flashback	to	terror.
Aftereffects	 or	 occasional	 recurrences	 of	 symptoms	 of ten	 persist,
says	Herman,	but	there	are	specific	signs	that	the	tr auma	has	largely
been	overcome.	These	include	reducing	the	physiological	symp toms	to
a	 manageable	 level,	 and	 being	 able	 to	 bear	 the	 feeli ngs	 associated
with	 memories	 of	 the	 trauma.	 Especially	 significant	 is 	 no	 longer
having	trauma	memories	erupt	at	uncontrollable	moments,	 but	rather
being	able	to	revisit	them	voluntarily,	like	any	oth er	memory—and,
perhaps	 more	 important,	 to	 put	 them	 aside	 like	 any	 oth er	 memory.
Finally,	 it	 means	 rebuilding	 a	 new	 life,	 with	 strong ,	 trusting
relationships	and	a	belief	system	that	finds	meaning	 even	in	a	world
where	such	injustice	can	happen. 20	All	of	these	together	are	markers
of	success	in	reeducating	the	emotional	brain.
PSYCHOTHERAPY	AS	AN	EMOTIONAL	TUTORIAL
Fortunately,	the	catastrophic	moments	in	which	traumat ic	memories
are	emblazoned	are	rare	during	the	course	of	life	fo r	most	of	us.	But
the	 same	 circuitry	 that	 can	 be	 seen	 so	 boldly	 imprint ing	 traumatic
memories	is	presumably	at	work	in	life’s	quieter	moments ,	too.	The
more	ordinary	travails	of	childhood,	such	as	being	c hronically	ignored
and	 deprived	 of	 attention	 or	 tenderness	 by	 one’s	 pa rents,
abandonment	 or	 loss,	 or	 social	 rejection	 may	 never	 re ach	 the	 fever
pitch	of	trauma,	but	they	surely	leave	their	imprint	 on	the	emotional
======================================== [Página 238] ========================================

brain,	 creating	 distortions—and	 tears	 and	 rages—in	 in timate
relationships	 later	 in	 life.	 If	 PTSD	 can	 be	 healed, 	 so	 can	 the	 more
muted	 emotional	 scars	 that	 so	 many	 of	 us	 bear;	 that	 is 	 the	 task	 of
psychotherapy.	And,	in	general,	it	is	in	learning	t o	deal	skillfully	with
these	loaded	reactions	that	emotional	intelligence	comes	int o	play.
The	 dynamic	 between	 the	 amygdala	 and	 the	 more	 fully	 in formed
reactions	of	the	prefrontal	cortex	may	offer	a	neuro anatomical	model
for	 how	 psychotherapy	 reshapes	 deep,	 maladaptive	 emot ional
patterns.	 As	 Joseph	 LeDoux,	 the	 neuroscientist	 who	 discovered	 the
amygdala’s	 hair-trigger	 role	 in	 emotional	 outbursts,	 conjectures,
“Once	your	emotional	system	learns	something,	it	seems	 you	never	let
it	 go.	 What	 therapy	 does	 is	 teach	 you	 to	 control	 it —it	 teaches	 your
neocortex	 how	 to	 inhibit	 your	 amygdala.	 The	 propensi ty	 to	 act	 is
suppressed,	while	your	basic	emotion	about	it	remains 	in	a	subdued
form.”
Given	 the	 brain	 architecture	 that	 underlies	 emotiona l	 relearning,
what	 seems	 to	 remain,	 even	 after	 successful	 psychothe rapy,	 is	 a
vestigial	reaction,	a	remnant	of	the	original	sensit ivity	or	fear	at	the
root	 of	 a	 troubling	 emotional	 pattern. 21	 The	 prefrontal	 cortex	 can
refine	or	put	the	brakes	on	the	amygdala’s	impulse	to 	rampage,	but
cannot	keep	it	from	reacting	in	the	first	place.	Thu s	while	we	cannot
decide	when 	we	have	our	emotional	outbursts,	we	have	more	contro l
over	how	long 	they	last.	A	quicker	recovery	time	from	such	outburs ts
may	well	be	one	mark	of	emotional	maturity.
Over	the	course	of	therapy,	what	seems	to	change	in	 the	main	are
the	responses 	that	people	make	once	an	emotional	reaction	is	trigg ered
—but	the	tendency	for	the	reaction	to	be	triggered	i n	the	first	place
does	not	disappear	entirely.	Evidence	for	this	comes 	from	a	series	of
studies	 of	 psychotherapy	 conducted	 by	 Lester	 Lubors ky	 and	 his
colleagues	 at	 the	 University	 of	 Pennsylvania. 22	 They	 analyzed	 the
main	 relationship	 conflicts	 that	 brought	 dozens	 of	 p atients	 into
psychotherapy—issues	such	as	a	deep	craving	to	be	ac cepted	or	find
intimacy,	or	a	fear	of	being	a	failure	or	being	over ly	dependent.	They
then	 carefully	 analyzed	 the	 typical	 (always	 self-de feating)	 responses
the	patients	made	when	these	wishes	and	fears	were	a ctivated	in	their
relationships—responses	such	as	being	too	demanding,	 which	created
a	backlash	of	anger	or	coldness	in	the	other	person ,	or	withdrawing	in
self-defense	 from	 an	 anticipated	 slight,	 leaving	 the 	 other	 person
miffed	 by	 the	 seeming	 rebuff.	 During	 such	 ill-fated	 e ncounters,	 the
patients,	 understandably,	 felt	 flooded	 by	 upsetting 	 feelings—
======================================== [Página 239] ========================================

hopelessness	 and	 sadness,	 resentment	 and	 anger,	 tens ion	 and	 fear,
guilt	and	self-blame,	and	so	on.	Whatever	the	specif ic	pattern	of	the
patient,	it	seemed	to	show	up	in	most	every	important	 relationship,
whether	with	a	spouse	or	lover,	a	child	or	parent,	 or	peers	and	bosses
at	work.
Over	the	course	of	long-term	therapy,	however,	these 	patients	made
two	kinds	of	changes:	their	emotional	reaction	to	th e	triggering	events
became	 less	 distressing,	 even	 calm	 or	 bemused,	 and	 the ir	 overt
responses	 became	 more	 effective	 in	 getting	 what	 they	 truly	 wanted
from	 the	 relationship.	 What	 did	 not	 change,	 however, 	 was	 their
underlying	wish	or	fear,	and	the	initial	twinge	of	 feeling.	By	the	time
the	patients	had	but	a	few	sessions	left	in	therapy ,	the	encounters	they
told	 about	 showed	 they	 had	 only	 half	 as	 many	 negativ e	 emotional
reactions	compared	to	when	they	first	started	therap y,	and	were	twice
as	 likely	 to	 get	 the	 positive	 response	 they	 deeply	 desired	 from	 the
other	 person.	 But	 what	 did	 not	 change	 at	 all	 was	 th e	 particular
sensitivity	at	the	root	of	these	needs.
In	 brain	 terms,	 we	 can	 speculate,	 the	 limbic	 circuitr y	 would	 send
alarm	signals	in	response	to	cues	of	a	feared	event, 	but	the	prefrontal
cortex	 and	 related	 zones	 would	 have	 learned	 a	 new,	 more	 healthy
response.	 In	 short,	 emotional	 lessons—even	 the	 most	 de eply
implanted	habits	of	the	heart	learned	in	childhood—ca n	be	reshaped.
Emotional	learning	is	lifelong.

Temperament	Is	Not	Destiny
So	much	for	altering	emotional	patterns	that	have	bee n	learned.	But
what	about	those	responses	that	are	givens	of	our	g enetic	endowment
—what	 of	 changing	 the	 habitual	 reactions	 of	 people	 w ho	 by	 nature
are,	say,	highly	volatile,	or	painfully	shy?	This	r ange	of	the	emotional
compass	 falls	 under	 the	 sweep	 of	 temperament,	 the	 back ground
murmur	of	feelings	that	mark	our	basic	disposition.	Te mperament	can
be	 defined	 in	 terms	 of	 the	 moods	 that	 typify	 our	 emoti onal	 life.	 To
some	 degree	 we	 each	 have	 such	 a	 favored	 emotional	 ran ge;
temperament	is	a	given	at	birth,	part	of	the	genetic	 lottery	that	has
compelling	force	in	the	unfolding	of	life.	Every	par ent	has	seen	this:
from	birth	a	child	will	be	calm	and	placid	or	testy	a nd	difficult.	The
question	is	whether	such	a	biologically	determined	e motional	set	can
be	changed	by	experience.	Does	our	biology	fix	our	 emotional	destiny,
or	can	even	an	innately	shy	child	grow	into	a	more	confident	adu lt?
The	clearest	answer	to	this	question	comes	from	the	w ork	of	Jerome
Kagan,	 the	 eminent	 developmental	 psychologist	 at	 Harv ard
University. 1	 Kagan	 posits	 that	 there	 are	 at	 least	 four	 temperamen tal
types—timid,	bold,	upbeat,	and	melancholy—and	that	each	is	due	t o	a
different	 pattern	 of	 brain	 activity.	 There	 are	 like ly	 innumerable
differences	 in	 temperamental	 endowment,	 each	 based	 in	 innate
differences	in	emotional	circuitry;	for	any	given	emo tion	people	can
differ	 in	 how	 easily	 it	 triggers,	 how	 long	 it	 lasts ,	 how	 intense	 it
becomes.	 Kagan’s	 work	 concentrates	 on	 one	 of	 these	 p atterns:	 the
dimension	of	temperament	that	runs	from	boldness	to	timidity.
For	decades	mothers	have	been	bringing	their	infants 	and	toddlers
to	Kagan’s	Laboratory	for	Child	Development	on	the	f ourteenth	floor
of	Harvard’s	 William	 James	 Hall	 to	 take	 part	 in	 his	 stu dies	 of	 child
development.	 It	 was	 there	 that	 Kagan	 and	 his	 coresea rchers	 noticed
early	 signs	 of	 shyness	 in	 a	 group	 of	 twenty-one-mont h-old	 toddlers
brought	 for	 experimental	 observations.	 In	 free	 play	 with	 other
toddlers,	 some	 were	 bubbly	 and	 spontaneous,	 playing	 with	 other
babies	 without	 the	 least	 hesitation.	 Others,	 though ,	 were	 uncertain
======================================== [Página 241] ========================================

and	 hesitant,	 hanging	 back,	 clinging	 to	 their	 mother s,	 quietly
watching	the	others	at	play.	Almost	four	years	later ,	when	these	same
children	 were	 in	 kindergarten,	 Kagan’s	 group	 observ ed	 them	 again.
Over	the	intervening	years	none	of	the	outgoing	chi ldren	had	become
timid,	while	two	thirds	of	the	timid	ones	were	still	reticent.
Kagan	finds	that	children	who	are	overly	sensitive	 and	fearful	grow
into	 shy	 and	 timorous	 adults;	 from	 birth	 about	 15	 to	 20	 percent	 of
children	 are	 “behaviorally	 inhibited,”	 as	 he	 calls	 them.	 As	 infants,
these	children	are	timid	about	anything	unfamiliar.	T his	makes	them
finicky	about	eating	new	foods,	reluctant	to	approa ch	new	animals	or
places,	 and	 shy	 around	 strangers.	 It	 also	 renders	 t hem	 sensitive	 in
other	ways—for	example,	prone	to	guilt	and	self-repro ach.	These	are
the	children	who	become	paralyzingly	anxious	in	soci al	situations:	in
class	and	on	the	playground,	when	meeting	new	people ,	whenever	the
social	 spotlight	 shines	 on	 them.	 As	 adults,	 they	 are 	 prone	 to	 be
wallflowers,	 and	 morbidly	 afraid	 of	 having	 to	 give	 a 	 speech	 or
perform	in	public.
Tom,	one	of	the	boys	in	Kagan’s	study,	is	typical	of 	the	shy	type.	At
every	measurement	through	childhood—two,	five,	and	sev en	years	of
age—Tom	was	among	the	most	timid	children.	When	intervie wed	at
thirteen,	 Tom	 was	 tense	 and	 stiff,	 biting	 his	 lip	 an d	 wringing	 his
hands,	 his	 face	 impassive,	 breaking	 into	 a	 tight	 smil e	 only	 when
talking	 about	 his	 girlfriend;	 his	 answers	 were	 shor t,	 his	 manner
subdued. 2	Throughout	the	middle	years	of	childhood,	until	abo ut	age
eleven,	 Tom	 remembers	 being	 painfully	 shy,	 breaking	 in to	 a	 sweat
whenever	 he	 had	 to	 approach	 playmates.	 He	 was	 also	 tr oubled	 by
intense	fears:	of	his	house	burning	down,	of	diving 	into	a	swimming
pool,	 of	 being	 alone	 in	 the	 dark.	 In	 frequent	 night mares,	 he	 was
attacked	by	monsters.	Though	he	has	felt	less	shy	in 	the	last	two	years
or	 so,	 he	 still	 feels	 some	 anxiety	 around	 other	 chil dren,	 and	 his
worries	now	center	on	doing	well	at	school,	even	th ough	he	is	in	the
top	5	percent	of	his	class.	The	son	of	a	scientist, 	Tom	finds	a	career	in
that	 field	 appealing,	 since	 its	 relative	 solitude	 f its	 his	 introverted
inclinations.
By	 contrast,	 Ralph	 was	 one	 of	 the	 boldest	 and	 most	 o utgoing
children	at	every	age.	Always	relaxed	and	talkative ,	at	thirteen	he	sat
back	at	ease	in	his	chair,	had	no	nervous	mannerisms, 	and	spoke	in	a
confident,	 friendly	 tone,	 as	 though	 the	 interviewer 	 were	 a	 peer—
though	 the	 difference	 in	 their	 ages	 was	 twenty-five 	 years.	 During
childhood	he	had	only	two	short-lived	fears—one	of	d ogs,	after	a	big
======================================== [Página 242] ========================================

dog	jumped	on	him	at	age	three,	and	another	of	flying ,	when	he	heard
about	 plane	 crashes	 at	 age	 seven.	 Sociable	 and	 popu lar,	 Ralph	 has
never	thought	of	himself	as	shy.
The	 timid	 children	 seem	 to	 come	 into	 life	 with	 a	 neura l	 circuitry
that	makes	them	more	reactive	to	even	mild	stress—from	bi rth,	their
hearts	beat	faster	than	other	infants’	in	response	 to	strange	or	novel
situations.	 At	 twenty-one	 months,	 when	 the	 reticent	 toddlers	 were
holding	 back	 from	 playing,	 heart	 rate	 monitors	 showed 	 that	 their
hearts	were	racing	with	anxiety.	That	easily	arouse d	anxiety	seems	to
underlie	their	lifelong	timidity:	they	treat	any	new 	person	or	situation
as	though	it	were	a	potential	threat.	Perhaps	as	a	 result,	middle-aged
women	who	remember	having	been	especially	shy	in	child hood,	when
compared	with	their	more	outgoing	peers,	tend	to	go	through	lif e	with
more	fears,	worries,	and	guilt,	and	to	suffer	more	fr om	stress-related
problems	 such	 as	 migraine	 headaches,	 irritable	 bowel, 	 and	 other
stomach	problems. 3
THE	NEUROCHEMISTRY	OF	TIMIDITY
The	difference	between	cautious	Tom	and	bold	Ralph,	 Kagan	believes,
lies	in	the	excitability	of	a	neural	circuit	center ed	on	the	amygdala.
Kagan	proposes	that	people	like	Tom,	who	are	prone	t o	fearfulness,
are	born	with	a	neurochemistry	that	makes	this	circui t	easily	aroused,
and	 so	 they	 avoid	 the	 unfamiliar,	 shy	 away	 from	 uncer tainty,	 and
suffer	 anxiety.	 Those	 who,	 like	 Ralph,	 have	 a	 nervo us	 system
calibrated	 with	 a	 much	 higher	 threshold	 for	 amygdala	 arousal,	 are
less	easily	frightened,	more	naturally	outgoing,	and 	eager	to	explore
new	places	and	meet	new	people.
An	early	clue	to	which	pattern	a	child	has	inherite d	is	how	difficult
and	irritable	she	is	as	an	infant,	and	how	distressed	she	beco mes	when
confronted	with	something	or	someone	unfamiliar.	While	about	o ne	in
five	infants	falls	into	the	timid	category,	about	tw o	in	five	have	the
bold	temperament—at	least	at	birth.
Part	of	Kagan’s	evidence	comes	from	observations	of	c ats	that	are
unusually	 timid.	 About	 one	 in	 seven	 housecats	 has	 a	 pattern	 of
fearfulness	akin	to	the	timid	children’s:	they	draw	 away	from	novelty
(instead	of	exhibiting	a	cat’s	legendary	curiosity),	they	a re	reluctant	to
explore	new	territory,	and	they	attack	only	the	smallest 	rodents,	being
too	 timid	 to	 take	 on	 larger	 ones	 that	 their	 more	 cour ageous	 feline
======================================== [Página 243] ========================================

peers	would	pursue	with	gusto.	Direct	brain	probes	 have	found	that
portions	of	the	amygdala	are	unusually	excitable	in	 these	timid	cats,
especially	 when,	 for	 instance,	 they	 hear	 a	 threaten ing	 howl	 from
another	cat.
The	cats’	timidity	blossoms	at	about	one	month	of	age, 	which	is	the
point	 when	 their	 amygdala	 matures	 enough	 to	 take	 cont rol	 of	 the
brain	 circuitry	 to	 approach	 or	 avoid.	 One	 month	 in	 k itten	 brain
maturation	is	akin	to	eight	months	in	a	human	infant;	 it	is	at	eight	or
nine	months,	Kagan	notes,	that	“stranger”	fear	appea rs	in	babies—if
the	baby’s	mother	leaves	a	room	and	there	is	a	strang er	present,	the
result	is	tears.	Timid	children,	Kagan	postulates,	ma y	have	inherited
chronically	 high	 levels	 of	 norepinephrine	 or	 other	 brain	 chemicals
that	 activate	 the	 amygdala	 and	 so	 create	 a	 low	 thres hold	 of
excitability,	making	the	amygdala	more	easily	triggered.
One	 sign	 of	 this	 heightened	 sensitivity	 is	 that,	 fo r	 example,	 when
young	 men	 and	 women	 who	 were	 quite	 shy	 in	 childhood	 a re
measured	 in	 a	 laboratory	 while	 exposed	 to	 stresses	 s uch	 as	 harsh
smells,	their	heart	rate	stays	elevated	much	longer	t han	for	their	more
outgoing	 peers—a	 sign	 that	 surging	 norepinephrine	 is 	 keeping	 their
amygdala	 excited	 and,	 through	 connected	 neural	 circu its,	 their
sympathetic	nervous	system	aroused. 4	Kagan	finds	that	timid	children
have	 higher	 levels	 of	 reactivity	 across	 the	 range	 o f	 sympathetic
nervous	 system	 indices,	 from	 higher	 resting	 blood	 pre ssure	 and
greater	 dilation	 of	 the	 pupils,	 to	 higher	 levels	 of 	 norepinephrine
markers	in	their	urine.
Silence	 is	 another	 barometer	 of	 timidity.	 Whenever	 Ka gan’s	 team
observed	 shy	 and	 bold	 children	 in	 a	 natural	 setting —in	 their
kindergarten	classes,	with	other	children	they	did	not	know ,	or	talking
with	 an	 interviewer—the	 timid	 children	 talked	 less.	 O ne	 timid
kindergartener	would	say	nothing	when	other	childre n	spoke	to	her,
and	 spent	 most	 of	 her	 day	 just	 watching	 the	 others	 p lay.	 Kagan
speculates	 that	 a	 timid	 silence	 in	 the	 face	 of	 novel ty	 or	 a	 perceived
threat	is	a	sign	of	the	activity	of	a	neural	circui t	running	between	the
forebrain,	the	amygdala,	and	nearby	limbic	structures 	that	control	the

stress).
These	sensitive	children	are	at	high	risk	for	devel oping	an	anxiety
disorder	 such	 as	 panic	 attacks,	 starting	 as	 early	 a s	 sixth	 or	 seventh
grade.	 In	 one	 study	 of	 754	 boys	 and	 girls	 in	 those	 grades,	 44	 were
found	 to	 have	 already	 suffered	 at	 least	 one	 episode 	 of	 panic,	 or	 to

have	had	several	preliminary	symptoms.	These	anxiety	e pisodes	were
usually	triggered	by	the	ordinary	alarms	of	early	ad olescence,	such	as
a	first	date	or	a	big	exam—alarms	that	most	children	ha ndle	without
developing	more	serious	problems.	But	teenagers	who	w ere	timid	by
temperament	 and	 who	 had	 been	 unusually	 frightened	 by	 new
situations	got	panic	symptoms	such	as	heart	palpitati ons,	shortness	of
breath,	 or	 a	 choking	 feeling,	 along	 with	 the	 feelin g	 that	 something
horrible	was	going	to	happen	to	them,	like	going	cra zy	or	dying.	The
researchers	 believe	 that	 while	 the	 episodes	 were	 no t	 significant
enough	to	rate	the	psychiatric	diagnosis	“panic	dis order,”	they	signal
that	 these	 teenagers	 would	 be	 at	 greater	 risk	 for	 d eveloping	 the
disorder	as	the	years	went	on;	many	adults	who	suffe r	panic	attacks
say	the	attacks	began	during	their	teen	years. 5
The	onset	of	the	anxiety	attacks	was	closely	tied	t o	puberty.	Girls
with	few	signs	of	puberty	reponed	no	such	attacks,	 but	of	those	who
had	gone	through	puberty	about	8	percent	said	they	 had	experienced
panic.	 Once	 they	 have	 had	 such	 an	 attack,	 they	 are	 prone	 to
developing	 the	 dread	 of	 a	 recurrence	 that	 leads	 peo ple	 with	 panic
disorder	to	shrink	from	life.
NOTHING	BOTHERS	ME:	THE	CHEERFUL	TEMPERAMENT
In	 the	 1920s,	 as	 a	 young	 woman,	 my	 aunt	 June	 left	 her 	 home	 in
Kansas	 City	 and	 ventured	 on	 her	 own	 to	 Shanghai—a	 da ngerous
journey	 for	 a	 solitary	 woman	 in	 those	 years.	 There	 J une	 met	 and
married	 a	 British	 detective	 in	 the	 colonial	 police	 f orce	 of	 that
international	 center	 of	 commerce	 and	 intrigue.	 When	 t he	 Japanese
captured	 Shanghai	 at	 the	 outset	 of	 World	 War	 II,	 my	 aunt	 and	 her
husband	were	interned	in	the	prison	camp	depicted	in 	the	book	and
movie	Empire	of	the	Sun .	 After	 surviving	 five	 horrific	 years	 in	 the
prison	 camp,	 she	 and	 her	 husband	 had,	 literally,	 los t	 everything.
Penniless,	they	were	repatriated	to	British	Columbia.
I	 remember	 as	 a	 child	 first	 meeting	 June,	 an	 ebullient 	 elderly
woman	 whose	 life	 had	 followed	 a	 remarkable	 course.	 In 	 her	 later
years	she	suffered	a	stroke	that	left	her	partly	pa ralyzed;	after	a	slow
and	arduous	recovery	she	was	able	to	walk	again,	bu t	with	a	limp.	In
those	 years	 I	 remember	 going	 for	 an	 outing	 with	 June, 	 then	 in	 her
seventies.	 Somehow	 she	 wandered	 off,	 and	 after	 sever al	 minutes	 I
heard	 a	 feeble	 yell—June	 crying	 for	 help.	 She	 had	 fa llen	 and	 could
======================================== [Página 245] ========================================

not	get	up	on	her	own.	I	rushed	to	help	her	up,	and	as	I	did	so,	ins tead
of	complaining	or	lamenting	she	laughed	at	her	predicament.	Her	o nly
comment	was	a	lighthearted	“Well,	at	least	I	can	walk	again.”
By	nature,	some	people’s	emotions	seem,	like	my	aunt’s,	to	gravit ate
toward	 the	 positive	 pole;	 these	 people	 are	 naturall y	 upbeat	 and
easygoing,	while	others	are	dour	and	melancholy.	Thi s	dimension	of
temperament—ebullience	at	one	end,	melancholy	at	the	oth er—seems
linked	to	the	relative	activity	of	the	right	and	le ft	prefrontal	areas,	the
upper	poles	of	the	emotional	brain.	That	insight	has 	emerged	largely
from	 the	 work	 of	 Richard	 Davidson,	 a	 University	 of	 W isconsin
psychologist.	He	discovered	that	people	who	have	gre ater	activity	in
the	 left	 frontal	 lobe,	 compared	 to	 the	 right,	 are	 by 	 temperament
cheerful;	 they	 typically	 take	 delight	 in	 people	 and 	 in	 what	 life
presents	 them	 with,	 bouncing	 back	 from	 setbacks	 as	 my	 aunt	 June
did.	 But	 those	 with	 relatively	 greater	 activity	 on	 the	 right	 side	 are
given	 to	 negativity	 and	 sour	 moods,	 and	 are	 easily	 f azed	 by	 life’s
difficulties;	in	a	sense,	they	seem	to	suffer	becaus e	they	cannot	turn
off	their	worries	and	depressions.
In	 one	 of	 Davidson’s	 experiments	 volunteers	 with	 the 	 most
pronounced	activity	in	the	left	frontal	areas	were	 compared	with	the
fifteen	 who	 showed	 most	 activity	 on	 the	 right.	 Those 	 with	 marked
right	frontal	activity	showed	a	distinctive	pattern 	of	negativity	on	a
personality	 test:	 they	 fit	 the	 caricature	 portrayed 	 by	 Woody	 Allen’s
comedy	roles,	the	alarmist	who	sees	catastrophe	in	th e	smallest	thing
—prone	to	funks	and	moodiness,	and	suspicious	of	a	wo rld	they	saw
as	 fraught	 with	 overwhelming	 difficulties	 and	 lurkin g	 dangers.	 By
contrast	 to	 their	 melancholy	 counterparts,	 those	 wit h	 stronger	 left
frontal	activity	saw	the	world	very	differently.	So ciable	and	cheerful,
they	 typically	 felt	 a	 sense	 of	 enjoyment,	 were	 frequ ently	 in	 good
moods,	 had	 a	 strong	 sense	 of	 self-confidence,	 and	 fe lt	 rewardingly
engaged	in	life.	Their	scores	on	psychological	test s	suggested	a	lower
lifetime	risk	for	depression	and	other	emotional	disorders. 6
People	who	have	a	history	of	clinical	depression,	D avidson	found,
had	lower	levels	of	brain	activity	in	the	left	fron tal	lobe,	and	more	on
the	right,	than	did	people	who	had	never	been	depre ssed.	He	found
the	 same	 pattern	 in	 patients	 newly	 diagnosed	 with	 de pression.
Davidson	 speculates	 that	 people	 who	 overcome	 depress ion	 have
learned	to	increase	the	level	of	activity	in	their	 left	prefrontal	lobe—a
speculation	awaiting	experimental	testing.
Though	 his	 research	 is	 on	 the	 30	 percent	 or	 so	 of	 p eople	 at	 the
======================================== [Página 246] ========================================

extremes,	 just	 about	 anyone	 can	 be	 classified	 by	 the ir	 brain	 wave
patterns	as	tending	toward	one	or	the	other	type,	s ays	Davidson.	The
contrast	in	temperament	between	the	morose	and	the	che erful	shows
up	 in	 many	 ways,	 large	 and	 small.	 For	 example,	 in	 one	 experiment
volunteers	 watched	 short	 film	 clips.	 Some	 were	 amusing —a	 gorilla
taking	a	bath,	a	puppy	at	play.	Others,	like	an	ins tructional	film	for
nurses	featuring	grisly	details	of	surgery,	were	qu ite	distressing.	The
right-hemisphere,	 somber	 folks	 found	 the	 happy	 movies	 only	 mildly
amusing,	 but	 they	 felt	 extreme	 fear	 and	 disgust	 in	 re action	 to	 the
surgical	blood	and	gore.	The	cheerful	group	had	mini mal	reactions	to
the	surgery;	their	strongest	reactions	were	of	deli ght	when	they	saw
the	upbeat	films.
Thus	we	seem	by	temperament	primed	to	respond	to	life	i n	either	a
negative	 or	 a	 positive	 emotional	 register.	 The	 tende ncy	 toward	 a
melancholy	 or	 upbeat	 temperament—like	 that	 toward	 timidi ty	 or
boldness—emerges	 within	 the	 first	 year	 of	 life,	 a	 fac t	 that	 strongly
suggests	it	too	is	genetically	determined.	Like	most	 of	the	brain,	the
frontal	lobes	are	still	maturing	in	the	first	few	mon ths	of	life,	and	so
their	activity	cannot	be	reliably	measured	until	the 	age	of	ten	months
or	so.	But	in	infants	that	young,	Davidson	found	th at	the	activity	level
of	 the	 frontal	 lobes	 predicted	 whether	 they	 would	 c ry	 when	 their
mothers	left	the	room.	The	correlation	was	virtually	 100	percent:	of
dozens	 of	 infants	 tested	 this	 way,	 every	 infant	 who 	 cried	 had	 more
brain	 activity	 on	 the	 right	 side,	 while	 those	 who	 d id	 not	 had	 more
activity	on	the	left.
Still,	even	if	this	basic	dimension	of	temperament	is	 laid	down	from
birth,	 or	 very	 nearly	 from	 birth,	 those	 of	 us	 who	 ha ve	 the	 morose
pattern	 are	 not	 necessarily	 doomed	 to	 go	 through	 lif e	 brooding	 and
crotchety.	 The	 emotional	 lessons	 of	 childhood	 can	 ha ve	 a	 profound
impact	 on	 temperament,	 either	 amplifying	 or	 muting	 an	 in nate
predisposition.	 The	 great	 plasticity	 of	 the	 brain	 i n	 childhood	 means
that	experiences	during	those	years	can	have	a	last ing	impact	on	the
sculpting	 of	 neural	 pathways	 for	 the	 rest	 of	 life.	 Perhaps	 the	 best
illustration	of	the	kinds	of	experiences	that	can	a lter	temperament	for
the	 better	 is	 in	 an	 observation	 that	 emerged	 from	 Kag an’s	 research
with	timid	children.
TAMING	THE	OVEREXCITABLE	AMYGDALA
======================================== [Página 247] ========================================

The	 encouraging	 news	 from	 Kagan’s	 studies	 is	 that	 no t	 all	 fearful
infants	grow	up	hanging	back	from	life—temperament	is	n ot	destiny.
The	overexcitable	amygdala	can	be	tamed,	with	the	rig ht	experiences.
What	 makes	 the	 difference	 are	 the	 emotional	 lessons	 a nd	 responses
children	learn	as	they	grow.	For	the	timid	child,	wh at	matters	at	the
outset	is	how	they	are	treated	by	their	parents,	an d	so	how	they	learn
to	handle	their	natural	timidness.	Those	parents	who 	engineer	gradual
emboldening	experiences	for	their	children	offer	the m	what	may	be	a
lifelong	corrective	to	their	fearfulness.
About	 one	 in	 three	 infants	 who	 come	 into	 the	 world	 w ith	 all	 the
signs	 of	 an	 overexcitable	 amygdala	 have	 lost	 their	 t imidness	 by	 the
time	 they	 reach	 kindergarten. 7	 From	 observations	 of	 these	 once-
fearful	 children	 at	 home,	 it	 is	 clear	 that	 parents,	 and	 especially
mothers,	play	a	major	role	in	whether	an	innately	timi d	child	grows
bolder	with	time	or	continues	to	shy	away	from	novelt y	and	become
upset	 by	 challenge.	 Kagan’s	 research	 team	 found	 that 	 some	 of	 the
mothers	 held	 to	 the	 philosophy	 that	 they	 should	 prot ect	 their	 timid
toddlers	 from	 whatever	 was	 upsetting;	 others	 felt	 th at	 it	 was	 more
important	 to	 help	 their	 timid	 child	 learn	 how	 to	 cope 	 with	 these
upsetting	 moments,	 and	 so	 adapt	 to	 life’s	 small	 strugg les.	 The
protective	 belief	 seems	 to	 have	 abetted	 the	 fearfuln ess,	 probably	 by
depriving	 the	 youngsters	 of	 opportunities	 for	 learn ing	 how	 to
overcome	their	fears.	The	“learn	to	adapt”	philosoph y	of	childrearing
seems	to	have	helped	fearful	children	become	braver.
Observations	in	the	homes	when	the	babies	were	about 	six	months
old	found	that	the	protective	mothers,	trying	to	soo the	their	infants,
picked	them	up	and	held	them	when	they	fretted	or	cri ed,	and	did	so
longer	 than	 those	 mothers	 who	 tried	 to	 help	 their	 in fants	 learn	 to
master	 these	 moments	 of	 upset.	 The	 ratio	 of	 times	 the	 i nfants	 were
held	when	calm	and	when	upset	showed	that	the	protec tive	mothers
held	 their	 infants	 much	 longer	 during	 the	 upsets	 tha n	 the	 calm
periods.
Another	difference	emerged	when	the	infants	were	aro und	one	year
old:	the	protective	mothers	were	more	lenient	and	ind irect	in	setting
limits	for	their	toddlers	when	they	were	doing	someth ing	that	might
be	 harmful,	 such	 as	 mouthing	 an	 object	 they	 might	 swal low.	 The
other	mothers,	by	contrast,	were	emphatic,	setting	fi rm	limits,	giving
direct	commands,	blocking	the	child’s	actions,	insisting	on	o bedience.
Why	 should	 firmness	 lead	 to	 a	 reduction	 in	 fearfulne ss?	 Kagan
speculates	that	there	is	something	learned	when	a	ba by	has	his	steady
======================================== [Página 248] ========================================

crawl	 toward	 what	 seems	 to	 him	 an	 intriguing	 object	 ( but	 to	 his
mother	a	dangerous	one)	interrupted	by	her	warning,	 “Get	away	from
that!”	The	infant	is	suddenly	forced	to	deal	with	a 	mild	uncertainty.
The	 repetition	 of	 this	 challenge	 hundreds	 and	 hundr eds	 of	 times
during	 the	 first	 year	 of	 life	 gives	 the	 infant	 cont inual	 rehearsals,	 in
small	 doses,	 of	 meeting	 the	 unexpected	 in	 life.	 For	 f earful	 children
that	 is	 precisely	 the	 encounter	 that	 has	 to	 be	 maste red,	 and
manageable	 doses	 are	 just	 right	 for	 learning	 the	 les son.	 When	 the
encounter	takes	place	with	parents	who,	though	lovi ng,	do	not	rush	to
pick	 up	 and	 soothe	 the	 toddler	 over	 every	 little	 up set,	 he	 gradually
learns	to	manage	such	moments	on	his	own.	By	age	two,	 when	these
formerly	fearful	toddlers	are	brought	back	to	Kagan’ s	laboratory,	they
are	far	less	likely	to	break	out	into	tears	when	a	 stranger	frowns	at
them,	or	an	experimenter	puts	a	blood-pressure	cuff	around	the ir	arm.
Kagan’s	 conclusion:	 “It	 appears	 that	 mothers	 who	 pro tect	 their
high[ly]	reactive	infants	from	frustration	and	anxie ty	in	the	hope	of
effecting	 a	 benevolent	 outcome	 seem	 to	 exacerbate	 the 	 infant’s
uncertainty	 and	 produce	 the	 opposite	 effect.” 8	 In	 other	 words,	 the
protective	 strategy	 backfires	 by	 depriving	 timid	 tod dlers	 of	 the	 very
opportunity	to	learn	to	calm	themselves	in	the	face	o f	the	unfamiliar,
and	 so	 gain	 some	 small	 mastery	 of	 their	 fears.	 At	 the	 neurological
level,	 presumably,	 this	 means	 their	 prefrontal	 circui ts	 missed	 the
chance	 to	 learn	 alternate	 responses	 to	 knee-jerk	 fe ar;	 instead,	 their
tendency	 for	 unbridled	 fearfulness	 may	 have	 been	 str engthened
simply	through	repetition.
In	contrast,	as	Kagan	told	me,	“Those	children	who	h ad	become	less
timid	 by	 kindergarten	 seem	 to	 have	 had	 parents	 who	 pu t	 gentle
pressure	on	them	to	be	more	outgoing.	Although	this	t emperamental
trait	seems	slightly	harder	than	others	to	change—probably	be cause	of
its	physiological	basis—no	human	quality	is	beyond	change.”
Throughout	 childhood	 some	 timid	 children	 grow	 bolder	 as
experience	 continues	 to	 mold	 the	 key	 neural	 circuitr y.	 One	 of	 the
signs	that	a	timid	child	will	be	more	likely	to	overc ome	this	natural
inhibition	 is	 having	 a	 higher	 level	 of	 social	 compet ence:	 being
cooperative	 and	 getting	 along	 with	 other	 children;	 being	 empathic,
prone	 to	 giving	 and	 sharing,	 and	 considerate;	 and	 b eing	 able	 to
develop	close	friendships.	These	traits	marked	a	gro up	of	children	first
identified	as	having	a	timid	temperament	at	age	four,	 who	shook	it	off
by	the	time	they	were	ten	years	old. 9
By	contrast,	those	timid	four-year-olds	whose	tempera ment	changed
======================================== [Página 249] ========================================

little	 over	 the	 same	 six	 years	 tended	 to	 be	 less	 abl e	 emotionally:
crying	 and	 falling	 apart	 under	 stress	 more	 easily;	 b eing	 emotionally
inappropriate;	 being	 fearful,	 sulky,	 or	 whiny;	 over reacting	 to	 minor
frustration	 with	 anger;	 having	 trouble	 delaying	 gra tification;	 being
overly	 sensitive	 to	 criticism,	 or	 mistrustful.	 These	 emotional	 lapses
are,	of	course,	likely	to	mean	their	relationships	w ith	other	children
will	 be	 troubled,	 should	 they	 be	 able	 to	 overcome	 th eir	 initial
reluctance	to	engage.
By	contrast,	it	is	easy	to	see	why	the	more	emotional ly	competent—
though	 shy	 by	 temperament—children	 spontaneously	 outgr ew	 their
timidity.	Being	more	socially	skilled,	they	were	far	more	likel y	to	have
a	succession	of	positive	experiences	with	other	chi ldren.	Even	if	they
were	tentative	about,	say,	speaking	to	a	new	playmat e,	once	the	ice
was	broken	they	were	able	to	shine	socially.	The	re gular	repetition	of
such	social	success	over	many	years	would	naturally	 tend	to	make	the
timid	more	sure	of	themselves.
These	advances	toward	boldness	are	encouraging;	the y	suggest	that
even	 innate	 emotional	 patterns	 can	 change	 to	 some	 deg ree.	 A	 child
who	comes	into	the	world	easily	frightened	can	learn 	to	be	calmer,	or
even	outgoing,	in	the	face	of	the	unfamiliar.	Fearfu lness—or	any	other
temperament—may	be	part	of	the	biological	givens	of	our 	emotional
lives,	but	we	are	not	necessarily	limited	to	a	speci fic	emotional	menu
by	 our	 inherited	 traits.	 There	 is	 a	 range	 of	 possib ility	 even	 within
genetic	constraints.	As	behavioral	geneticists	obse rve,	genes	alone	do
not	 determine	 behavior;	 our	 environment,	 especially	 w hat	 we
experience	 and	 learn	 as	 we	 grow,	 shapes	 how	 a	 temper amental
predisposition	expresses	itself	as	life	unfolds.	Ou r	emotional	capacities
are	not	a	given;	with	the	right	learning,	they	can	 be	improved.	The
reasons	for	this	lie	in	how	the	human	brain	matures.
CHILDHOOD:	A	WINDOW	OF	OPPORTUNITY
The	human	brain	is	by	no	means	fully	formed	at	birth.	 It	continues	to
shape	 itself	 through	 life,	 with	 the	 most	 intense	 gro wth	 occurring
during	 childhood.	 Children	 are	 born	 with	 many	 more	 ne urons	 than
their	mature	brain	will	retain;	through	a	process	kn own	as	“pruning”
the	brain	actually	loses	the	neuronal	connections	t hat	are	less	used,
and	forms	strong	connections	in	those	synaptic	circu its	that	have	been
utilized	the	most.	Pruning,	by	doing	away	with	extra neous	synapses,
======================================== [Página 250] ========================================

improves	the	signal-to-noise	ratio	in	the	brain	by	r emoving	the	cause
of	 the	 “noise.”	 This	 process	 is	 constant	 and	 quick; 	 synaptic
connections	 can	 form	 in	 a	 matter	 of	 hours	 or	 days.	 Ex perience,
particularly	in	childhood,	sculpts	the	brain.
The	 classic	 demonstration	 of	 the	 impact	 of	 experience 	 on	 brain
growth	was	by	Nobel	Prize-winners	Thorsten	Wiesel	a nd	David	Hubel,
both	neuroscientists. 10	They	showed	that	in	cats	and	monkeys,	there
was	 a	 critical	 period	 during	 the	 first	 few	 months	 of 	 life	 for	 the
development	 of	 the	 synapses	 that	 carry	 signals	 from	 t he	 eye	 to	 the
visual	cortex,	where	those	signals	are	interpreted. 	If	one	eye	was	kept
closed	during	that	period,	the	number	of	synapses	fr om	that	eye	to	the
visual	 cortex	 dwindled	 away,	 while	 those	 from	 the	 op en	 eye
multiplied.	 If	 after	 the	 critical	 period	 ended	 the	 c losed	 eye	 was
reopened,	 the	 animal	 was	 functionally	 blind	 in	 that	 eye.	 Although
nothing	was	wrong	with	the	eye	itself,	there	were	t oo	few	circuits	to
the	visual	cortex	for	signals	from	that	eye	to	be	interpreted.
In	humans	the	corresponding	critical	period	for	visi on	lasts	for	the
first	 six	 years	 of	 life.	 During	 this	 time	 normal	 seei ng	 stimulates	 the
formation	 of	 increasingly	 complex	 neural	 circuitry	 fo r	 vision	 that
begins	in	the	eye	and	ends	in	the	visual	cortex.	If	a	ch ild’s	eye	is	taped
closed	for	even	a	few	weeks,	it	can	produce	a	measur able	deficit	in
the	visual	capacity	of	that	eye.	If	a	child	has	had 	one	eye	closed	for
several	months	during	this	period,	and	later	has	it	 restored,	that	eye’s
vision	for	detail	will	be	impaired.
A	 vivid	 demonstration	 of	 the	 impact	 of	 experience	 on	 the
developing	brain	is	in	studies	of	“rich”	and	“poor” 	rats. 11	The	“rich”
rats	lived	in	small	groups	in	cages	with	plenty	of	r at	diversions	such
as	 ladders	 and	 treadmills.	 The	 “poor”	 rats	 lived	 in	 cages	 that	 were
similar	but	barren	and	lacking	diversions.	Over	a	pe riod	of	months	the
neocortices	of	the	rich	rats	developed	far	more	compl ex	networks	of
synaptic	circuits	interconnecting	the	neurons;	the	 poor	rats’	neuronal
circuitry	was	sparse	by	comparison.	The	difference	w as	so	great	that
the	rich	rats’	brains	were	heavier,	and,	perhaps	no t	surprisingly,	they
were	 far	 smarter	 at	 solving	 mazes	 than	 the	 poor	 rats. 	 Similar
experiments	 with	 monkeys	 show	 these	 differences	 betwe en	 those
“rich”	and	“poor”	in	experience,	and	the	same	effect 	is	sure	to	occur
in	humans.
Psychotherapy—that	is,	systematic	emotional	relearning —stands	as
a	 case	 in	 point	 for	 the	 way	 experience	 can	 both	 cha nge	 emotional
patterns	and	shape	the	brain.	The	most	dramatic	demons tration	comes
======================================== [Página 251] ========================================

from	 a	 study	 of	 people	 being	 treated	 for	 obsessive-c ompulsive
disorder. 12	 One	 of	 the	 more	 common	 compulsions	 is	 hand	 washing,
which	can	be	done	so	often,	even	hundreds	of	times	i n	a	day,	that	the
person’s	 skin	 cracks.	 PET	 scan	 studies	 show	 that	 ob sessive-
compulsives	 have	 greater	 than	 normal	 activity	 in	 the	 prefrontal
lobes. 13
Half	 of	 the	 patients	 in	 the	 study	 received	 the	 stand ard	 drug
treatment,	fluoxetine	(better	known	by	the	brand	name 	Prozac),	and
half	 got	 behavior	 therapy.	 During	 the	 therapy	 they	 were
systematically	exposed	to	the	object	of	their	obsess ion	or	compulsion
without	performing	it;	patients	with	hand-washing	co mpulsions	were
put	at	a	sink,	but	not	allowed	to	wash.	At	the	same	 time	they	learned
to	question	the	fears	and	dreads	that	spurred	them	o n—for	example,
that	 failure	 to	 wash	 would	 mean	 they	 would	 get	 a	 dis ease	 and	 die.
Gradually,	 through	 months	 of	 such	 sessions,	 the	 compu lsions	 faded,
just	as	they	did	with	the	medication.
The	remarkable	finding,	though,	was	a	PET	scan	test	 showing	that
the	 behavior	 therapy	 patients	 had	 as	 significant	 a	 decrease	 in	 the
activity	of	a	key	part	of	the	emotional	brain,	the	c audate	nucleus,	as
did	 the	 patients	 successfully	 treated	 with	 the	 drug 	 fluoxetine.	 Their
experience	 had	 changed	 brain	 function—and	 relieved	 s ymptoms—as
effectively	as	the	medication!
CRUCIAL	WINDOWS
Of	 all	 species	 we	 humans	 take	 the	 longest	 for	 our	 br ains	 to	 fully
mature.	 While	 each	 area	 of	 the	 brain	 develops	 at	 a	 d ifferent	 rate
during	 childhood,	 the	 onset	 of	 puberty	 marks	 one	 of	 the	 most
sweeping	periods	of	pruning	throughout	the	brain.	S everal	brain	areas
critical	for	emotional	life	are	among	the	slowest	to	 mature.	While	the
sensory	areas	mature	during	early	childhood,	and	the 	limbic	system
by	 puberty,	 the	 frontal	 lobes—seat	 of	 emotional	 self- control,
understanding,	 and	 artful	 response—continue	 to	 devel op	 into	 late
adolescence,	until	somewhere	between	sixteen	and	eig hteen	years	of
age. 14
The	 habits	 of	 emotional	 management	 that	 are	 repeated	 o ver	 and
over	 again	 during	 childhood	 and	 the	 teenage	 years	 w ill	 themselves
help	 mold	 this	 circuitry.	 This	 makes	 childhood	 a	 cruc ial	 window	 of

acquired	 in	 childhood	 become	 set	 in	 the	 basic	 synapt ic	 wiring	 of

importance	 of	 the	 prefrontal	 lobes	 for	 managing	 emotio n,	 the	 very
long	 window	 for	 synaptic	 sculpting	 in	 this	 brain	 re gion	 may	 well
mean	that,	in	the	grand	design	of	the	brain,	a	child ’s	experiences	over
the	years	can	mold	lasting	connections	in	the	regula tory	circuitry	of
the	 emotional	 brain.	 As	 we	 have	 seen,	 critical	 exper iences	 include
how	dependable	and	responsive	to	the	child’s	needs	 parents	are,	the
opportunities	and	guidance	a	child	has	in	learning	 to	handle	her	own
distress	 and	 control	 impulse,	 and	 practice	 in	 empathy .	 By	 the	 same
token,	 neglect	 or	 abuse,	 the	 misattunement	 of	 a	 self- absorbed	 or
indifferent	parent,	or	brutal	discipline	can	leave	 their	imprint	on	the
emotional	circuitry. 15
One	of	the	most	essential	emotional	lessons,	first	le arned	in	infancy
and	 refined	 throughout	 childhood,	 is	 how	 to	 soothe	 oneself	 when
upset.	 For	 very	 young	 infants,	 soothing	 comes	 from	 ca retakers:	 a
mother	 hears	 her	 infant	 crying,	 picks	 him	 up,	 holds	 a nd	 rocks	 him
until	 he	 calms	 down.	 This	 biological	 attunement,	 some	 theorists
propose,	 helps	 the	 child	 begin	 to	 learn	 how	 to	 do	 t he	 same	 for
himself. 16	During	a	critical	period	between	ten	and	eighteen	 months,
the	orbitofrontal	area	of	the	prefrontal	cortex	is	 rapidly	forming	the
connections	 with	 the	 limbic	 brain	 that	 will	 make	 it	 a 	 key	 on/off
switch	 for	 distress.	 The	 infant	 who	 through	 countle ss	 episodes	 of
being	 soothed	 is	 helped	 along	 in	 learning	 how	 to	 ca lm	 down,	 the
speculation	 goes,	 will	 have	 stronger	 connections	 in 	 this	 circuit	 for
controlling	distress,	and	so	throughout	life	will	b e	better	at	soothing
himself	when	upset.
To	be	sure,	the	art	of	soothing	oneself	is	mastered	 over	many	years,
and	with	new	means,	as	brain	maturation	offers	a	chil d	progressively
more	 sophisticated	 emotional	 tools.	 Remember,	 the	 front al	 lobes,	 so
important	 for	 regulating	 limbic	 impulse,	 mature	 into	 ad olescence. 17
Another	key	circuit	that	continues	to	shape	itself	 through	childhood
centers	on	the	vagus	nerve,	which	at	one	end	regula tes	the	heart	and
other	parts	of	the	body,	and	at	the	other	sends	signals	to	the	a mygdala
via	other	circuits,	prompting	it	to	secrete	the	cate cholamines,	which
prime	 the	 fight-or-flight	 response.	 A	 University	 of	 Washington	 team
that	 assessed	 the	 impact	 of	 childrearing	 discovered	 that	 emotionally
adept	parenting	led	to	a	change	for	the	better	in	vagus-nerve 	function.
As	John	Gottman,	the	psychologist	who	led	the	resear ch,	explained,
“Parents	modify	their	children’s	vagal	tone”—a	measure 	of	how	easily
======================================== [Página 253] ========================================

triggered	the	vagus	nerve	is—“by	coaching	them	emotion ally:	talking
to	 children	 about	 their	 feelings	 and	 how	 to	 underst and	 them,	 not
being	 critical	 and	 judgmental,	 problem-solving	 about	 emotional
predicaments,	 coaching	 them	 on	 what	 to	 do,	 like	 alter natives	 to
hitting,	 or	 to	 withdrawing	 when	 you’re	 sad.”	 When	 p arents	 did	 this
well,	 children	 were	 better	 able	 to	 suppress	 the	 vag al	 activity	 that
keeps	the	amygdala	priming	the	body	with	fight-or-fli ght	hormones—
and	so	were	better	behaved.
It	stands	to	reason	that	the	key	skills	of	emotional 	intelligence	each
have	critical	periods	extending	over	several	years	 in	childhood.	Each
period	 represents	 a	 window	 for	 helping	 that	 child	 i nstill	 beneficial
emotional	habits	or,	if	missed,	to	make	it	that	much	ha rder	to	offer
corrective	lessons	later	in	life.	The	massive	sculpt ing	and	pruning	of
neural	circuits	in	childhood	may	be	an	underlying	re ason	why	early
emotional	 hardships	 and	 trauma	 have	 such	 enduring	 and 	 pervasive
effects	in	adulthood.	It	may	explain,	too,	why	psychotherapy 	can	often
take	so	long	to	affect	some	of	these	patterns—and	why ,	as	we’ve	seen,
even	 after	 therapy	 those	 patterns	 tend	 to	 remain	 as	 underlying
propensities,	 though	 with	 an	 overlay	 of	 new	 insight s	 and	 relearned
responses.
To	be	sure,	the	brain	remains	plastic	throughout	lif e,	though	not	to
the	spectacular	extent	seen	in	childhood.	All	learning	impli es	a	change
in	 the	 brain,	 a	 strengthening	 of	 synaptic	 connectio n.	 The	 brain
changes	in	the	patients	with	obsessive-compulsive	di sorder	show	that
emotional	habits	are	malleable	throughout	life,	with	 some	sustained
effort,	even	at	the	neural	level.	What	happens	with 	the	brain	in	PTSD
(or	in	therapy,	for	that	matter)	is	an	analog	of	the 	effects	all	repeated
or	intense	emotional	experiences	bring,	for	better	or	for	wor se.
Some	of	the	most	telling	of	such	lessons	come	from	pare nt	to	child.
There	are	very	different	emotional	habits	instilled	 by	parents	whose
attunement	means	an	infant’s	emotional	needs	are	ackno wledged	and
met	or	whose	discipline	includes	empathy,	on	the	one	 hand,	or	self-
absorbed	 parents	 who	 ignore	 a	 child’s	 distress	 or	 w ho	 discipline
capriciously	by	yelling	and	hitting.	Much	psychothe rapy	is,	in	a	sense,
a	remedial	tutorial	for	what	was	skewed	or	missed	comp letely	earlier
in	life.	But	why	not	do	what	we	can	to	prevent	that 	need,	by	giving
children	 the	 nurturing	 and	 guidance	 that	 cultivates 	 the	 essential
emotional	skills	in	the	first	place?

The	Cost	of	Emotional	Illiteracy
It	began	as	a	small	dispute,	but	had	escalated.	Ian	 Moore,	a	senior	at
Thomas	 Jefferson	 High	 School	 in	 Brooklyn,	 and	 Tyrone	 Sinkler,	 a
junior,	 had	 had	 a	 falling-out	 with	 a	 buddy,	 fifteen -year-old	 Khalil
Sumpter.	Then	they	had	started	picking	on	him	and	maki ng	threats.
Now	it	exploded.
Khalil,	 scared	 that	 Ian	 and	 Tyrone	 were	 going	 to	 be at	 him	 up,
brought	a	.38	caliber	pistol	to	school	one	morning,	 and,	fifteen	feet
from	a	school	guard,	shot	both	boys	to	death	at	poin t-blank	range	in
the	school’s	hallway.
The	incident,	chilling	as	it	is,	can	be	read	as	yet 	another	sign	of	a
desperate	 need	 for	 lessons	 in	 handling	 emotions,	 set tling
disagreements	peaceably,	and	just	plain	getting	alon g.	Educators,	long
disturbed	by	schoolchildren’s	lagging	scores	in	math 	and	reading,	are
realizing	there	is	a	different	and	more	alarming	defi ciency:	emotional
illiteracy. 1	 And	 while	 laudable	 efforts	 are	 being	 made	 to	 raise
academic	 standards,	 this	 new	 and	 troubling	 deficienc y	 is	 not	 being
addressed	in	the	standard	school	curriculum.	As	one	 Brooklyn	teacher
put	 it,	 the	 present	 emphasis	 in	 schools	 suggests	 tha t	 “we	 care	 more
about	 how	 well	 schoolchildren	 can	 read	 and	 write	 th an	 whether
they’ll	be	alive	next	week.”
Signs	of	the	deficiency	can	be	seen	in	violent	inci dents	such	as	the
shooting	of	Ian	and	Tyrone,	growing	ever	more	common	i n	American
schools.	But	these	are	more	than	isolated	events;	th e	heightening	of
the	turmoil	of	adolescence	and	troubles	of	childhood 	can	be	read	for
the	United	States—a	bellwether	of	world	trends—in	sta tistics	such	as
these: 2
In	1990,	compared	to	the	previous	two	decades,	the	U nited	States
saw	 the	 highest	 juvenile	 arrest	 rate	 for	 violent	 cr imes	 ever;	 teen
arrests	for	forcible	rape	had	doubled;	teen	murder	r ates	quadrupled,
mostly	 due	 to	 an	 increase	 in	 shootings. 3	 During	 those	 same	 two
decades,	the	suicide	rate	for	teenagers	tripled,	as 	did	the	number	of
children	under	fourteen	who	are	murder	victims. 4
======================================== [Página 256] ========================================

More,	and	younger,	teenage	girls	are	getting	pregna nt.	As	of	1993
the	 birthrate	 among	 girls	 ten	 to	 fourteen	 has	 risen	 steadily	 for	 five
years	 in	 a	 row—some	 call	 it	 “babies	 having	 babies”—as	 has	 the
proportion	 of	 unwanted	 teen	 pregnancies	 and	 peer	 pr essure	 to	 have
sex.	Rates	of	venereal	disease	among	teenagers	have	 tripled	over	the
last	three	decades. 5
While	 these	 figures	 are	 discouraging,	 if	 the	 focus	 is	 on	 African-
American	youth,	especially	in	the	inner	city,	they	a re	utterly	bleak—
all	the	rates	are	higher	by	far,	sometimes	doubled,	s ometimes	tripled
or	 higher.	 For	 example,	 heroin	 and	 cocaine	 use	 among	 white	 youth
climbed	about	300	percent	over	the	two	decades	befor e	the	1990s;	for
African-American	youth	it	jumped	to	a	staggering	 13	times 	the	rate	of
twenty	years	before. 6
The	 most	 common	 cause	 of	 disability	 among	 teenagers	 is	 mental
illness.	Symptoms	of	depression,	whether	major	or	minor ,	affect	up	to
one	third	of	teenagers;	for	girls,	the	incidence	of 	depression	doubles	at
puberty.	 The	 frequency	 of	 eating	 disorders	 in	 teena ge	 girls	 has
skyrocketed. 7
Finally,	 unless	 things	 change,	 the	 long-term	 prospec ts	 for	 today’s
children	 marrying	 and	 having	 a	 fruitful,	 stable	 life 	 together	 are
growing	more	dismal	with	each	generation.	As	we	saw	i n	Chapter	9 ,
while	 during	 the	 1970s	 and	 1980s	 the	 divorce	 rate	 w as	 around	 50
percent,	as	we	entered	the	1990s	the	rate	among	newl yweds	predicted
that	two	out	of	three	marriages	of	young	people	would	end	in	div orce.
AN	EMOTIONAL	MALAISE
These	alarming	statistics	are	like	the	canary	in	the 	coal	miner’s	tunnel
whose	 death	 warns	 of	 too	 little	 oxygen.	 Beyond	 such 	 sobering
numbers,	 the	 plight	 of	 today’s	 children	 can	 be	 seen	 at	 more	 subtle
levels,	 in	 day-to-day	 problems	 that	 have	 not	 yet	 blo ssomed	 into
outright	 crises.	 Perhaps	 the	 most	 telling	 data	 of	 al l—a	 direct
barometer	 of	 dropping	 levels	 of	 emotional	 competence—ar e	 from	 a
national	 sample	 of	 American	 children,	 ages	 seven	 to	 s ixteen,
comparing	their	emotional	condition	in	the	mid-1970s	a nd	at	the	end
of	the	1980s. 8	Based	on	parents’	and	teachers’	assessments,	there	 was
a	steady	worsening.	No	one	problem	stood	out;	all	in dicators	simply
crept	 steadily	 in	 the	 wrong	 direction.	 Children,	 on 	 average,	 were
doing	more	poorly	in	these	specific	ways:
======================================== [Página 257] ========================================

•	Withdrawal	or	social	problems: 	 preferring	 to	 be	 alone;	 being
secretive;	sulking	a	lot;	lacking	energy;	feeling	u nhappy;	being	overly
dependent
•	Anxious	and	depressed: 	 being	 lonely;	 having	 many	 fears	 and
worries;	needing	to	be	perfect;	feeling	unloved;	fe eling	nervous	or	sad
and	depressed
•	Attention	or	thinking	problems: 	unable	to	pay	attention	or	sit	still;
daydreaming;	 acting	 without	 thinking;	 being	 too	 nerv ous	 to
concentrate;	 doing	 poorly	 on	 schoolwork;	 unable	 to	 get	 mind	 off
thoughts
•	Delinquent	or	aggressive: 	hanging	around	kids	who	get	in	trouble;
lying	 and	 cheating;	 arguing	 a	 lot;	 being	 mean	 to	 oth er	 people;
demanding	attention;	destroying	other	people’s	thing s;	disobeying	at
home	 and	 at	 school;	 being	 stubborn	 and	 moody;	 talking 	 too	 much;
teasing	a	lot;	having	a	hot	temper
While	any	of	these	problems	in	isolation	raises	no	e yebrows,	taken
as	a	group	they	are	barometers	of	a	sea	change,	a	ne w	kind	of	toxicity
seeping	 into	 and	 poisoning	 the	 very	 experience	 of	 c hildhood,
signifying	sweeping	deficits	in	emotional	competences .	This	emotional
malaise	 seems	 to	 be	 a	 universal	 price	 of	 modern	 life	 f or	 children.
While	 Americans	 often	 decry	 their	 problems	 as	 particu larly	 bad
compared	 to	 other	 cultures’,	 studies	 around	 the	 worl d	 have	 found
rates	on	a	par	with	or	worse	than	in	the	United	Sta tes.	For	example,	in
the	 1980s	 teachers	 and	 parents	 in	 the	 Netherlands,	 China,	 and
Germany	rated	children	at	about	the	same	level	of	pro blems	as	were
found	 for	 American	 children	 in	 1976.	 And	 some	 countri es	 had
children	in	worse	shape	than	current	U.S.	levels,	i ncluding	Australia,
France,	 and	 Thailand.	 But	 this	 may	 not	 remain	 true	 fo r	 long.	 The
larger	 forces	 that	 propel	 the	 downward	 spiral	 in	 emo tional
competence	seem	to	be	picking	up	speed	in	the	United	 States	relative
to	many	other	developed	nations. 9
No	children,	rich	or	poor,	are	exempt	from	risk;	thes e	problems	are
universal,	 occurring	 in	 all	 ethnic,	 racial,	 and	 inc ome	 groups.	 Thus
while	 children	 in	 poverty	 have	 the	 worst	 record	 on	 indices	 of
emotional	skills,	their	 rate	 of	 deterioration	 over	 the	 decades	 was	 no
worse	than	for	middle-class	children	or	for	wealthy	 children:	all	show
the	same	steady	slide.	There	has	also	been	a	corresp onding	threefold
rise	 in	 the	 number	 of	 children	 who	 have	 gotten	 psych ological	 help
======================================== [Página 258] ========================================

(perhaps	a	good	sign,	signaling	that	help	is	more	av ailable),	as	well	as
a	 near	 doubling	 of	 the	 number	 of	 children	 who	 have	 e nough
emotional	problems	that	they	 should 	get	such	help	but	have	not	(a	bad
sign)—from	about	9	percent	in	1976	to	18	percent	in	1989.
Urie	Bronfenbrenner,	the	eminent	Cornell	University	 developmental
psychologist	who	did	an	international	comparison	of	 children’s	well-
being,	says:	“In	the	absence	of	good	support	systems ,	external	stresses
have	become	so	great	that	even	strong	families	are	fa lling	apart.	The
hecticness,	 instability,	 and	 inconsistency	 of	 daily 	 family	 life	 are
rampant	 in	 all	 segments	 of	 our	 society,	 including	 the 	 well-educated
and	 well-to-do.	 What	 is	 at	 stake	 is	 nothing	 less	 th an	 the	 next
generation,	 particularly	 males,	 who	 in	 growing	 up	 ar e	 especially
vulnerable	 to	 such	 disruptive	 forces	 as	 the	 devasta ting	 effects	 of
divorce,	poverty,	and	unemployment.	The	status	of	Amer ican	children
and	 families	 is	 as	 desperate	 as	 ever.…	 We	 are	 deprivi ng	 millions	 of
children	of	their	competence	and	moral	character.” 10
This	 is	 not	 just	 an	 American	 phenomenon	 but	 a	 global	 one,	 with
worldwide	competition	to	drive	down	labor	costs	crea ting	economic
forces	that	press	on	the	family.	These	are	times	of	f inancially	besieged
families	in	which	both	parents	work	long	hours,	so	t hat	children	are
left	to	their	own	devices	or	the	TV	baby-sits;	when 	more	children	than
ever	grow	up	in	poverty;	when	the	one-parent	family	is	becoming 	ever
more	 commonplace;	 when	 more	 infants	 and	 toddlers	 are	 le ft	 in	 day
care	so	poorly	run	that	it	amounts	to	neglect.	All	t his	means,	even	for
well-intentioned	 parents,	 the	 erosion	 of	 the	 countl ess	 small,
nourishing	exchanges	between	parent	and	child	that	 build	emotional
competences.
If	families	no	longer	function	effectively	to	put	al l	our	children	on	a
firm	footing	for	life,	what	are	we	to	do?	A	more	care ful	look	at	the
mechanics	 of	 specific	 problems	 suggests	 how	 given	 def icits	 in
emotional	 or	 social	 competences	 lay	 the	 foundation	 fo r	 grave
problems—and	how	well-aimed	correctives	or	preventives 	could	keep
more	children	on	track.
TAMING	AGGRESSION
In	 my	 elementary	 school	 the	 tough	 kid	 was	 Jimmy,	 a	 four th	 grader
when	I	was	in	first	grade.	He	was	the	kid	who	would 	steal	your	lunch
money,	take	your	bike,	slug	you	as	soon	as	talk	to	you.	Jimmy	was	th e
======================================== [Página 259] ========================================

classic	bully,	starting	fights	with	the	least	provo cation,	or	none	at	all.
We	 all	 stood	 in	 awe	 of	 Jimmy—and	 we	 all	 stood	 at	 a	 dis tance.
Everyone	 hated	 and	 feared	 Jimmy;	 no	 one	 would	 play	 wi th	 him.	 It
was	 as	 though	 everywhere	 he	 went	 on	 the	 playground	 an	 invisible
bodyguard	cleared	kids	out	of	his	way.
Kids	like	Jimmy	are	clearly	troubled.	But	what	may	be	 less	obvious
is	 that	 being	 so	 flagrantly	 aggressive	 in	 childhood 	 is	 a	 mark	 of
emotional	and	other	troubles	to	come.	Jimmy	was	in	jail 	for	assault
by	the	time	he	reached	sixteen.
The	lifelong	legacy	of	childhood	aggressiveness	in	 kids	like	Jimmy
has	emerged	from	many	studies. 11	As	we	have	seen,	the	family	life	of
such	 aggressive	 children	 typically	 includes	 parents 	 who	 alternate
neglect	 with	 harsh	 and	 capricious	 punishments,	 a	 pat tern	 that,
perhaps	 understandably,	 makes	 the	 children	 a	 bit	 par anoid	 or
combative.
Not	 all	 angry	 children	 are	 bullies;	 some	 are	 withdra wn	 social
outcasts	 who	 overreact	 to	 being	 teased	 or	 to	 what	 t hey	 perceive	 as
slights	 or	 unfairness.	 But	 the	 one	 perceptual	 flaw	 that	 unites	 such
children	 is	 that	 they	 perceive	 slights	 where	 none	 w ere	 intended,
imagining	 their	 peers	 to	 be	 more	 hostile	 toward	 them	 t han	 they
actually	 are.	 This	 leads	 them	 to	 misperceive	 neutral	 acts	 as
threatening	 ones—an	 innocent	 bump	 is	 seen	 as	 a	 vendet ta—and	 to
attack	in	return.	That,	of	course,	leads	other	chil dren	to	shun	them,
isolating	 them	 further.	 Such	 angry,	 isolated	 childre n	 are	 highly
sensitive	 to	 injustices	 and	 being	 treated	 unfairly. 	 They	 typically	 see
themselves	 as	 victims	 and	 can	 recite	 a	 list	 of	 instan ces	 when,	 say,
teachers	 blamed	 them	 for	 doing	 something	 when	 in	 fact	 they	 were
innocent.	Another	trait	of	such	children	is	that	on ce	they	are	in	the
heat	of	anger	they	can	think	of	only	one	way	to	react:	by	lashin g	out.
These	 perceptual	 biases	 can	 be	 seen	 at	 work	 in	 an	 e xperiment	 in
which	bullies	are	paired	with	a	more	peaceable	child 	to	watch	videos.
In	one	video,	a	boy	drops	his	books	when	another	kn ocks	into	him,
and	children	standing	nearby	laugh;	the	boy	who	dro pped	the	books
gets	angry	and	tries	to	hit	one	of	those	who	laughe d.	When	the	boys
who	watched	the	video	talk	about	it	afterward,	the	 bully	always	sees
the	 boy	 who	 struck	 out	 as	 justified.	 Even	 more	 telli ng,	 when	 they
have	to	rate	how	aggressive	the	boys	were	during	th eir	discussion	of
the	video,	the	bullies	see	the	boy	who	knocked	into 	the	other	as	more
combative,	and	the	anger	of	the	boy	who	struck	out	as	justified .12
This	jump	to	judgment	testifies	to	a	deep	perceptual	 bias	in	people
======================================== [Página 260] ========================================

who	are	unusually	aggressive:	they	act	on	the	basis 	of	the	assumption
of	 hostility	 or	 threat,	 paying	 too	 little	 attention 	 to	 what	 is	 actually
going	 on.	 Once	 they	 assume	 threat,	 they	 leapfrog	 to	 action.	 For
instance,	 if	 an	 aggressive	 boy	 is	 playing	 checkers	 with	 another	 who
moves	 a	 piece	 out	 of	 turn,	 he’ll	 interpret	 the	 move	 a s	 “cheating”
without	 pausing	 to	 find	 out	 if	 it	 had	 been	 an	 innoc ent	 mistake.	 His
presumption	is	of	malevolence	rather	than	innocence;	 his	reaction	is
automatic	hostility.	Along	with	the	knee-jerk	percep tion	of	a	hostile
act	 is	 entwined	 an	 equally	 automatic	 aggression;	 ins tead	 of,	 say,
pointing	out	to	the	other	boy	that	he	made	a	mistake, 	he	will	jump	to
accusation,	yelling,	hitting.	And	the	more	such	chil dren	do	this,	the
more	 automatic	 aggression	 becomes	 for	 them,	 and	 the	 more 	 the
repertoire	of	alternatives—politeness,	joking—shrinks.
Such	 children	 are	 emotionally	 vulnerable	 in	 the	 sens e	 that	 they
have	 a	 low	 threshold	 for	 upset,	 getting	 peeved	 more	 often	 by	 more
things;	once	upset,	their	thinking	is	muddled,	so	th at	they	see	benign
acts	 as	 hostile	 and	 fall	 back	 on	 their	 overlearned	 habit	 of	 striking
out. 13
These	perceptual	biases	toward	hostility	are	alread y	in	place	by	the
early	 grades.	 While	 most	 children,	 and	 especially	 bo ys,	 are
rambunctious	 in	 kindergarten	 and	 first	 grade,	 the	 mor e	 aggressive
children	 fail	 to	 learn	 a	 modicum	 of	 self-control	 by	 s econd	 grade.
Where	 other	 children	 have	 started	 to	 learn	 negotiat ion	 and
compromise	for	playground	disagreements,	the	bullies	r ely	more	and
more	 on	 force	 and	 bluster.	 They	 pay	 a	 social	 price:	 within	 two	 or
three	hours	of	a	first	playground	contact	with	a	bu lly,	other	children
already	say	they	dislike	him. 14
But	 studies	 that	 have	 followed	 children	 from	 the	 pre school	 years
into	 the	 teenage	 ones	 find	 that	 up	 to	 half	 of	 first 	 graders	 who	 are
disruptive,	unable	to	get	along	with	other	kids,	di sobedient	with	their
parents,	and	resistant	with	teachers	will	become	del inquents	in	their
teen	 years. 15	 Of	 course,	 not	 all	 such	 aggressive	 children	 are	 on 	 the
trajectory	that	leads	to	violence	and	criminality	in 	later	life.	But	of	all
children,	 these	 are	 the	 ones	 most	 at	 risk	 for	 eventu ally	 committing
violent	crimes.
The	 drift	 toward	 crime	 shows	 up	 surprisingly	 early	 i n	 these
children’s	lives.	When	children	in	a	Montreal	kinde rgarten	were	rated
for	hostility	and	troublemaking,	those	highest	at	ag e	five	already	had
far	 greater	 evidence	 of	 delinquency	 just	 five	 to	 ei ght	 years	 later,	 in
their	 early	 teens.	 They	 were	 about	 three	 times	 as	 li kely	 as	 other
======================================== [Página 261] ========================================

children	 to	 admit	 they	 had	 beaten	 up	 someone	 who	 had	 not	 done
anything	 to	 them,	 to	 have	 shoplifted,	 to	 have	 used	 a 	 weapon	 in	 a
fight,	to	have	broken	into	or	stolen	parts	from	a	ca r,	and	to	have	been
drunk—and	all	this	before	they	reached	fourteen	years	of	age. 16
The	 prototypical	 pathway	 to	 violence	 and	 criminality 	 starts	 with
children	 who	 are	 aggressive	 and	 hard	 to	 handle	 in	 f irst	 and	 second
grade. 17	Typically,	from	the	earliest	school	years	their	poo r	impulse
control	 also	 contributes	 to	 their	 being	 poor	 studen ts,	 seen	 as,	 and
seeing	themselves	as,	“dumb”—a	judgment	confirmed	by	the ir	being
shunted	 to	 special-education	 classes	 (and	 though	 su ch	 children	 may
have	 a	 higher	 rate	 of	 “hyperactivity”	 or	 learning	 d isorders,	 by	 no
means	all	do).	Children	who	on	entering	school	alrea dy	have	learned
in	their	homes	a	“coercive”	style—that	is,	bullying—ar e	also	written
off	by	their	teachers,	who	have	to	spend	too	much	ti me	keeping	the
children	in	line.	The	defiance	of	classroom	rules	th at	comes	naturally
to	these	children	means	that	they	waste	time	that	wou ld	otherwise	be
used	in	learning;	their	destined	academic	failure	is 	usually	obvious	by
about	 third	 grade.	 While	 boys	 on	 a	 trajectory	 towar d	 delinquency
tend	 to	 have	 lower	 IQ	 scores	 than	 their	 peers,	 thei r	 impulsivity	 is
more	directly	at	cause:	impulsivity	in	ten-year-old	b oys	is	almost	three
times	 as	 powerful	 a	 predictor	 of	 their	 later	 delinqu ency	 as	 is	 their
IQ.18
By	fourth	or	fifth	grade	these	kids—by	now	seen	as	b ullies	or	just
“difficult”—are	rejected	by	their	peers	and	are	unab le	to	make	friends
easily,	 if	 at	 all,	 and	 have	 become	 academic	 failures. 	 Feeling
themselves	friendless,	they	gravitate	to	other	socia l	outcasts.	Between
grade	 four	 and	 grade	 nine	 they	 commit	 themselves	 to	 th eir	 outcast
group	and	a	life	of	defying	the	law:	they	show	a	fi vefold	increase	in
their	 truancy,	 drinking,	 and	 drug	 taking,	 with	 the	 biggest	 boost
between	seventh	and	eighth	grade.	By	the	middle-scho ol	years,	they
are	joined	by	another	type	of	“late	starters,”	who	 are	attracted	to	their
defiant	 style;	 these	 late	 starters	 are	 often	 youngs ters	 who	 are
completely	unsupervised	at	home	and	have	started	roaming	the	st reets
on	 their	 own	 in	 grade	 school.	 In	 the	 high-school	 ye ars	 this	 outcast
group	 typically	 drops	 out	 of	 school	 in	 a	 drift	 towa rd	 delinquency,
engaging	in	petty	crimes	such	as	shoplifting,	theft,	and	drug 	dealing.
(A	 telling	 difference	 emerges	 in	 this	 trajectory	 bet ween	 boys	 and
girls.	A	study	of	fourth-grade	girls	who	were	“bad” —getting	in	trouble
with	teachers	and	breaking	rules,	but	not	unpopular 	with	their	peers
—found	 that	 40	 percent	 had	 a	 child	 by	 the	 time	 they	 f inished	 the
======================================== [Página 262] ========================================

high-school	years. 19	That	was	three	times	the	average	pregnancy	rate
for	girls	in	their	schools.	In	other	words,	antisoc ial	teenage	girls	don’t
get	violent—they	get	pregnant.)
There	is,	of	course,	no	single	pathway	to	violence	 and	criminality,
and	many	other	factors	can	put	a	child	at	risk:	bein g	born	in	a	high-
crime	neighborhood	where	they	are	exposed	to	more	temp tations	to
crime	and	violence,	coming	from	a	family	under	high	lev els	of	stress,
or	living	in	poverty.	But	none	of	these	factors	make s	a	life	of	violent
crime	 inevitable.	 All	 things	 being	 equal,	 the	 psycho logical	 forces	 at
work	 in	 aggressive	 children	 greatly	 intensify	 the	 l ikelihood	 of	 their
ending	 up	 as	 violent	 criminals.	 As	 Gerald	 Patterson, 	 a	 psychologist
who	has	closely	followed	the	careers	of	hundreds	of 	boys	into	young
adulthood,	 puts	 it,	 “the	 anti-social	 acts	 of	 a	 five -year-old	 may	 be
prototypic	of	the	acts	of	the	delinquent	adolescent.” 20
SCHOOL	FOR	BULLIES
The	bent	of	mind	that	aggressive	children	take	with	 them	through	life
is	 one	 that	 almost	 ensures	 they	 will	 end	 up	 in	 troub le.	 A	 study	 of
juvenile	offenders	convicted	of	violent	crimes	and	o f	aggressive	high-
school	 students	 found	 a	 common	 mind-set:	 When	 they	 hav e
difficulties	with	someone,	they	immediately	see	the	ot her	person	in	an
antagonistic	 way,	 jumping	 to	 conclusions	 about	 the	 o ther	 person’s
hostility	 toward	 them	 without	 seeking	 any	 further	 in formation	 or
trying	 to	 think	 of	 a	 peaceful	 way	 to	 settle	 their	 d ifferences.	 At	 the
same	 time,	 the	 negative	 consequence	 of	 a	 violent	 solu tion—a	 fight,
typically—never	crosses	their	mind.	Their	aggressive	 bent	is	justified
in	their	mind	by	beliefs	like,	“It’s	okay	to	hit	some one	if	you	just	go
crazy	from	anger”;	“If	you	back	down	from	a	fight	eve ryone	will	think
you’re	a	coward”;	and	“People	who	get	beaten	up	bad ly	don’t	really
suffer	that	much.” 21
But	 timely	 help	 can	 change	 these	 attitudes	 and	 stop	 a	 child’s
trajectory	 toward	 delinquency;	 several	 experimental	 programs	 have
had	some	success	in	helping	such	aggressive	kids	lea rn	to	control	their
antisocial	bent	before	it	leads	to	more	serious	trou ble.	One,	at	Duke
University,	 worked	 with	 anger-ridden	 grade-school	 t roublemakers	 in
training	 sessions	 for	 forty	 minutes	 twice	 a	 week	 for 	 six	 to	 twelve
weeks.	 The	 boys	 were	 taught,	 for	 example,	 to	 see	 how 	 some	 of	 the
social	cues	they	interpreted	as	hostile	were	in	fac t	neutral	or	friendly.
======================================== [Página 263] ========================================

They	learned	to	take	the	perspective	of	other	child ren,	to	get	a	sense
of	 how	 they	 were	 being	 seen	 and	 of	 what	 other	 child ren	 might	 be
thinking	and	feeling	in	the	encounters	that	had	got ten	them	so	angry.
They	also	got	direct	training	in	anger	control	thro ugh	enacting	scenes,
such	as	being	teased,	that	might	lead	them	to	lose	th eir	temper.	One
of	 the	 key	 skills	 for	 anger	 control	 was	 monitoring	 t heir	 feelings—
becoming	aware	of	their	body’s	sensations,	such	as	f lushing	or	muscle
tensing,	as	they	were	getting	angry,	and	to	take	th ose	feelings	as	a	cue
to	 stop	 and	 consider	 what	 to	 do	 next	 rather	 than	 st rike	 out
impulsively.
John	Lochman,	a	Duke	University	psychologist	who	was 	one	of	the
designers	of	the	program,	told	me,	“They’ll	discuss	s ituations	they’ve
been	in	recently,	like	being	bumped	in	the	hallway	w hen	they	think	it
was	 on	 purpose.	 The	 kids	 will	 talk	 about	 how	 they	 mi ght	 have
handled	it.	One	kid	said,	for	example,	that	he	just	 stared	at	the	boy
who	bumped	him	and	told	him	not	to	do	it	again,	and	wa lked	away.
That	put	him	in	the	position	of	exerting	some	control 	and	keeping	his
self-esteem,	without	starting	a	fight.”
This	appeals;	many	such	aggressive	boys	are	unhappy	 that	they	lose
their	temper	so	easily,	and	so	are	receptive	to	lear ning	to	control	it.	In
the	 heat	 of	 the	 moment,	 of	 course,	 such	 cool-headed	 r esponses	 as
walking	away	or	counting	to	ten	so	the	impulse	to	hi t	will	pass	before
reacting	are	not	automatic;	the	boys	practice	such	a lternatives	in	role-
playing	scenes	such	as	getting	on	a	bus	where	other 	kids	are	taunting
them.	That	way	they	can	try	out	friendly	responses	t hat	preserve	their
dignity	while	giving	them	an	alternative	to	hitting, 	crying,	or	running
away	in	shame.
Three	years	after	the	boys	had	been	through	the	tra ining,	Lochman
compared	these	boys	with	others	who	had	been	just	as 	aggressive,	but
did	not	have	the	benefit	of	the	anger-control	sessi ons.	He	found	that,
in	adolescence,	the	boys	who	graduated	from	the	prog ram	were	much
less	disruptive	in	class,	had	more	positive	feelings 	about	themselves,
and	were	less	likely	to	drink	or	take	drugs.	And	th e	longer	they	had
been	in	the	program,	the	less	aggressive	they	were	as	teenager s.
PREVENTING	DEPRESSION
Dana,	sixteen,	had	always	seemed	to	get	along.	But	no w,	suddenly,	she	just	could	not
relate	with	other	girls,	and,	more	troubling	for	her,	she 	could	not	find	a	way	to	hold	on
======================================== [Página 264] ========================================

to	boyfriends,	even	though	she	slept	with	them.	Morose	and 	constantly	fatigued,	Dana
lost	interest	in	eating,	in	having	fun	of	any	kind;	she 	said	she	felt	hopeless	and	helpless
to	do	anything	to	escape	her	mood,	and	was	thinking	of	s uicide.
The	drop	into	depression	had	been	triggered	by	her	most	 recent	breakup.	She	said
she	didn’t	know	how	to	go	out	with	a	boy	without	gettin g	sexually	involved	right	away
—even	if	she	was	uncomfortable	about	it—and	that	she	did	n ot	know	how	to	end	a
relationship	even	if	it	was	unsatisfying.	She	went	to	b ed	with	boys,	she	said,	when	all
she	really	wanted	to	do	was	get	to	know	them	better.
She	had	just	moved	to	a	new	school,	and	felt	shy	and	anxi ous	about	making	friends
with	girls	there.	For	instance,	she	held	back	from	starti ng	conversations,	only	talking
once	someone	spoke	to	her.	She	felt	unable	to	let	them	kn ow	what	she	was	like,	and
didn’t	even	feel	she	knew	what	to	say	after	“Hello,	how	 are	you?”22
Dana	 went	 for	 therapy	 to	 an	 experimental	 program	 for	 depressed
adolescents	at	Columbia	University.	Her	treatment	focu sed	on	helping
her	 learn	 how	 to	 handle	 her	 relationships	 better:	 h ow	 to	 develop	 a
friendship,	how	to	feel	more	confident	with	other	te ens,	how	to	assert
limits	 on	 sexual	 closeness,	 how	 to	 be	 intimate,	 how	 t o	 express	 her
feelings.	 In	 essence,	 it	 was	 a	 remedial	 tutorial	 in	 some	 of	 the	 most
basic	emotional	skills.	And	it	worked;	her	depression	lifted .
Particularly	in	young	people,	problems	in	relationsh ips	are	a	trigger
for	 depression.	 The	 difficulty	 is	 as	 often	 in	 child ren’s	 relationships
with	 their	 parents	 as	 it	 is	 with	 their	 peers.	 Depre ssed	 children	 and
teenagers	 are	 frequently	 unable	 or	 unwilling	 to	 tal k	 about	 their
sadness.	They	seem	unable	to	label	their	feelings	ac curately,	showing
instead	 a	 sullen	 irritability,	 impatience,	 crankines s,	 and	 anger—
especially	toward	their	parents.	This,	in	turn,	make s	it	harder	for	their
parents	 to	 offer	 the	 emotional	 support	 and	 guidance	 the	 depressed
child	 actually	 needs,	 setting	 in	 motion	 a	 downward	 s piral	 that
typically	ends	in	constant	arguments	and	alienation.
A	 new	 look	 at	 the	 causes	 of	 depression	 in	 the	 young 	 pinpoints
deficits	in	two	areas	of	emotional	competence:	relati onship	skills,	on
the	 one	 hand,	 and	 a	 depression-promoting	 way	 of	 inte rpreting
setbacks,	 on	 the	 other.	 While	 some	 of	 the	 tendency	 t o	 depression
almost	 certainly	 is	 due	 to	 genetic	 destiny,	 some	 of	 t hat	 tendency
seems	due	to	reversible,	pessimistic	habits	of	though t	that	predispose
children	to	react	to	life’s	small	defeats—a	bad	grade ,	arguments	with
parents,	 a	 social	 rejection—by	 becoming	 depressed.	 An d	 there	 is
evidence	to	suggest	that	the	predisposition	to	depr ession,	whatever	its
basis,	is	becoming	ever	more	widespread	among	the	young.

A	COST	OF	MODERNITY:	RISING	RATES	OF	DEPRESSION
These	millennial	years	are	ushering	in	an	Age	of	Mel ancholy,	just	as
the	 twentieth	 century	 became	 an	 Age	 of	 Anxiety.	 Inte rnational	 data
show	what	seems	to	be	a	modern	epidemic	of	depression, 	one	that	is
spreading	 side	 by	 side	 with	 the	 adoption	 throughout 	 the	 world	 of
modern	 ways.	 Each	 successive	 generation	 worldwide	 si nce	 the
opening	of	the	century	has	lived	with	a	higher	risk 	than	their	parents
of	 suffering	 a	 major	 depression—not	 just	 sadness,	 but 	 a	 paralyzing
listlessness,	 dejection,	 and	 self-pity,	 and	 an	 over whelming
hopelessness—over	 the	 course	 of	 life. 23	 And	 those	 episodes	 are
beginning	 at	 earlier	 and	 earlier	 ages.	 Childhood	 de pression,	 once
virtually	unknown	(or,	at	least,	unrecognized)	is	e merging	as	a	fixture
of	the	modern	scene.
Although	the	likelihood	of	becoming	depressed	rises	 with	age,	the
greatest	increases	are	among	young	people.	For	those 	born	after	1955
the	likelihood	they	will	suffer	a	major	depression	a t	some	point	in	life
is,	 in	 many	 countries,	 three	 times	 or	 more	 greater	 tha n	 for	 their
grandparents.	Among	Americans	born	before	1905,	the	r ate	of	those
having	a	major	depression	over	a	lifetime	was	just	1	 percent;	for	those
born	 since	 1955,	 by	 age	 twenty-four	 about	 6	 percent 	 had	 become
depressed.	 For	 those	 born	 between	 1945	 and	 1954,	 th e	 chances	 of
having	 had	 a	 major	 depression	 before	 age	 thirty-four 	 are	 ten	 times
greater	than	for	those	born	between	1905	and	1914. 24	And	for	each
generation	 the	 onset	 of	 a	 person’s	 first	 episode	 of 	 depression	 has
tended	to	occur	at	an	ever-earlier	age.
A	worldwide	study	of	more	than	thirty-nine	thousand	 people	found
the	 same	 trend	 in	 Puerto	 Rico,	 Canada,	 Italy,	 Germany ,	 France,
Taiwan,	Lebanon,	and	New	Zealand.	In	Beirut,	the	ris e	of	depression
tracked	 political	 events	 closely,	 the	 upward	 trends 	 rocketing	 during
periods	of	civil	war.	In	Germany,	for	those	born	bef ore	1914	the	rate
of	 depression	 by	 age	 thirty-five	 is	 4	 percent;	 for	 those	 born	 in	 the
decade	 before	 1944	 it	 is	 14	 percent	 at	 age	 thirty-f ive.	 Worldwide,
generations	 that	 came	 of	 age	 during	 politically	 trou bled	 times	 had
higher	 rates	 of	 depression,	 though	 the	 overall	 upwa rd	 trend	 holds
apart	from	any	political	events.
The	lowering	into	childhood	of	the	age	when	people	first	expe rience
depression	 also	 seems	 to	 hold	 worldwide.	 When	 I	 aske d	 experts	 to
hazard	a	guess	as	to	why,	there	were	several	theories.
Dr.	 Frederick	 Goodwin,	 then	 director	 of	 the	 Nationa l	 Institute	 of
======================================== [Página 266] ========================================

Mental	Health,	speculated,	“There’s	been	a	tremendous 	erosion	of	the
nuclear	family—a	doubling	of	the	divorce	rate,	a	drop 	in	parents’	time
available	to	children,	and	an	increase	in	mobility.	 You	don’t	grow	up
knowing	 your	 extended	 family	 much	 anymore.	 The	 losses	 of	 these
stable	 sources	 of	 self-identification	 mean	 a	 greater 	 susceptibility	 to
depression.”
Dr.	 David	 Kupfer,	 chairman	 of	 psychiatry	 at	 the	 Univ ersity	 of
Pittsburgh	medical	school,	pointed	to	another	trend: 	“With	the	spread
of	industrialization	after	World	War	II,	in	a	sense 	nobody	was	home
anymore.	In	more	and	more	families	there	has	been	growi ng	parental
indifference	to	children’s	needs	as	they	grow	up.	T his	is	not	a	direct
cause	 of	 depression,	 but	 it	 sets	 up	 a	 vulnerability .	 Early	 emotional
stressors	 may	 affect	 neuron	 development,	 which	 can	 le ad	 to	 a
depression	when	you	are	under	great	stress	even	decades	late r.”
Martin	 Seligman,	 the	 University	 of	 Pennsylvania	 psyc hologist,
proposed:	“For	the	last	thirty	or	forty	years	we’ve 	seen	the	ascendance
of	 individualism	 and	 a	 waning	 of	 larger	 beliefs	 in	 r eligion,	 and	 in
supports	from	the	community	and	extended	family.	That	me ans	a	loss
of	resources	that	can	buffer	you	against	setbacks	a nd	failures.	To	the
extent	 you	 see	 a	 failure	 as	 something	 that	 is	 lastin g	 and	 which	 you
magnify	 to	 taint	 everything	 in	 your	 life,	 you	 are	 pr one	 to	 let	 a
momentary	defeat	become	a	lasting	source	of	hopelessne ss.	But	if	you
have	a	larger	perspective,	like	a	belief	in	God	and	an	afterli fe,	and	you
lose	your	job,	it’s	just	a	temporary	defeat.”
Whatever	the	cause,	depression	in	the	young	is	a	pr essing	problem.
In	the	United	States,	estimates	vary	widely	for	how	many	childr en	and
teens	 are	 depressed	 in	 any	 given	 year,	 as	 opposed	 t o	 vulnerability
over	their	lifetime.	Some	epidemiological	studies	usin g	strict	criteria
—the	 official	 diagnostic	 symptoms	 for	 depression—have	 f ound	 that
for	 boys	 and	 girls	 between	 ten	 and	 thirteen	 the	 rat e	 of	 major
depression	 over	 the	 course	 of	 a	 year	 is	 as	 high	 as	 8	 or	 9	 percent,
though	other	studies	place	it	at	about	half	that	ra te	(and	some	as	low
as	 about	 2	 percent).	 At	 puberty,	 some	 data	 suggest,	 the	 rate	 nearly
doubles	 for	 girls;	 up	 to	 16	 percent	 of	 girls	 betwee n	 fourteen	 and
sixteen	 suffer	 a	 bout	 of	 depression,	 while	 the	 rate 	 is	 unchanged	 for
boys. 25
THE	COURSE	OF	DEPRESSION	IN	THE	YOUNG
======================================== [Página 267] ========================================

That	depression	should	not	just	be	treated,	but	 prevented ,	in	children	is
clear	from	an	alarming	discovery:	Even	mild	episodes	o f	depression	in
a	child	can	augur	more	severe	episodes	later	in	life .26	This	challenges
the	 old	 assumption	 that	 depression	 in	 childhood	 does 	 not	 matter	 in
the	 long	 run,	 since	 children	 supposedly	 “grow	 out	 o f	 it.”	 Of	 course,
every	child	gets	sad	from	time	to	time;	childhood	and	adolescenc e	are,
like	adulthood,	times	of	occasional	disappointments	a nd	losses	large
and	small	with	the	attendant	grief.	The	need	for	pre vention	is	not	for
these	 times,	 but	 for	 those	 children	 for	 whom	 sadness	 spirals
downward	 into	 a	 gloom	 that	 leaves	 them	 despairing,	 ir ritable,	 and
withdrawn—a	far	more	severe	melancholy.
Among	 children	 whose	 depression	 was	 severe	 enough	 th at	 they
were	referred	for	treatment,	three	quarters	had	a	su bsequent	episode
of	severe	depression,	according	to	data	collected	b y	Maria	Kovacs,	a
psychologist	 at	 Western	 Psychiatric	 Institute	 and	 C linic	 in
Pittsburgh. 27	Kovacs	studied	children	diagnosed	with	depression	 when
they	were	as	young	as	eight	years	old,	assessing	th em	every	few	years
until	some	were	as	old	as	twenty-four.
The	 children	 with	 major	 depression	 had	 episodes	 last ing	 about
eleven	months	on	average,	though	in	one	in	six	of	th em	it	persisted
for	as	long	as	eighteen	months.	Mild	depression,	whi ch	began	as	early
as	 age	 five	 in	 some	 children,	 was	 less	 incapacitatin g	 but	 lasted	 far
longer—an	average	of	about	four	years.	And,	Kovacs	f ound,	children
who	have	a	minor	depression	are	more	likely	to	have	i t	intensify	into
major	depression—a	so-called	double	depression.	Those 	who	develop
double	depression	are	much	more	prone	to	suffer	recur ring	episodes
as	the	years	go	on.	As	children	who	had	an	episode	of	depressio n	grew
into	adolescence	and	early	adulthood,	they	suffered 	from	depression
or	manic-depressive	disorder,	on	average,	one	year	in	three.
The	cost	to	children	goes	beyond	the	suffering	caus ed	by	depression
itself.	Kovacs	told	me,	“Kids	learn	social	skills	in 	their	peer	relations—
for	example,	what	to	do	if	you	want	something	and	are n’t	getting	it,
seeing	 how	 other	 children	 handle	 the	 situation	 and	 then	 trying	 it
yourself.	 But	 depressed	 kids	 are	 likely	 to	 be	 among	 the	 neglected
children	in	a	school,	the	ones	other	kids	don’t	play	with	much. ”28
The	 sullenness	 or	 sadness	 such	 children	 feel	 leads	 them	 to	 avoid
initiating	social	contacts,	or	to	look	away	when	an other	child	is	trying
to	engage	them—a	social	signal	the	other	child	only	t akes	as	a	rebuff;
the	end	result	is	that	depressed	children	end	up	re jected	or	neglected
on	 the	 playground.	 This	 lacuna	 in	 their	 interperson al	 experience
======================================== [Página 268] ========================================

means	they	miss	out	on	what	they	would	normally	learn	 in	the	rough-
and-tumble	 of	 play,	 and	 so	 can	 leave	 them	 social	 and	 emotional
laggards,	 with	 much	 catching	 up	 to	 do	 after	 the	 depr ession	 lifts. 29
Indeed,	 when	 depressed	 children	 have	 been	 compared	 t o	 those
without	depression,	they	have	been	found	to	be	more	socially	i nept,	to
have	fewer	friends,	to	be	less	preferred	than	others	as	playma tes,	to	be
less	 liked,	 and	 to	 have	 more	 troubled	 relationships	 with	 other
children.
Another	cost	to	these	children	is	doing	poorly	in	s chool;	depression
interferes	with	their	memory	and	concentration,	making 	it	harder	to
pay	attention	in	class	and	retain	what	is	taught.	A 	child	who	feels	no
joy	 in	 anything	 will	 find	 it	 hard	 to	 marshal	 the	 ene rgy	 to	 master
challenging	 lessons,	 let	 alone	 experience	 flow	 in	 l earning.
Understandably,	the	longer	children	in	Kovacs’s	stu dy	were	depressed,
the	 more	 their	 grades	 dropped	 and	 the	 poorer	 they	 di d	 on
achievement	tests,	so	that	they	were	more	likely	to	b e	held	back	in
school.	In	fact,	 there	was	a	 direct	correlation	bet ween	 the	length	 of
time	a	child	had	been	depressed	and	his	grade-point	 average,	with	a
steady	plummet	over	the	course	of	the	episode.	All	of 	this	academic
rough	 going,	 of	 course,	 compounds	 the	 depression.	 As 	 Kovacs
observes,	 “Imagine	 you’re	 already	 feeling	 depressed, 	 and	 you	 start
flunking	 out	 of	 school,	 and	 you	 sit	 home	 by	 yourself 	 instead	 of
playing	with	other	kids.”
DEPRESSIONOGENIC	WAYS	OF	THOUGHT
Just	as	with	adults,	pessimistic	ways	of	interpretin g	life’s	defeats	seem
to	 feed	 the	 sense	 of	 helplessness	 and	 hopelessness	 at	 the	 heart	 of
children’s	depression.	That	people	who	are	 already 	depressed	think	in
these	 ways	 has	 long	 been	 known.	 What	 has	 only	 recen tly	 emerged,
though,	 is	 that	 children	 who	 are	 most	 prone	 to	 melanc holy	 tend
toward	 this	 pessimistic	 outlook	 before 	 they	 become	 depressed.	 This
insight	suggests	a	window	of	opportunity	for	inocul ating	them	against
depression	before	it	strikes.
One	line	of	evidence	comes	from	studies	of	children’s 	beliefs	about
their	own	ability	to	control	what	happens	in	their	 lives—for	example,
being	 able	 to	 change	 things	 for	 the	 better.	 This	 is 	 assessed	 by
children’s	 ratings	 of	 themselves	 in	 such	 terms	 as	 “Wh en	 I	 have
problems	 at	 home	 I’m	 better	 than	 most	 kids	 at	 helping	 t o	 solve	 the
======================================== [Página 269] ========================================

problems”	and	“When	I	work	hard	I	get	good	grades.”	 Children	who
say	none	of	these	positive	descriptions	fits	them	ha ve	little	sense	that
they	 can	 do	 anything	 to	 change	 things;	 this	 sense	 o f	 helplessness	 is
highest	in	those	children	who	are	most	depressed. 30
A	telling	study	looked	at	fifth	and	sixth	graders	in	the	few	da ys	after
they	received	report	cards.	As	we	all	remember,	repor t	cards	are	one
of	 the	 greatest	 sources	 of	 elation	 and	 despair	 in	 c hildhood.	 But
researchers	 find	 a	 marked	 consequence	 in	 how	 childre n	 assess	 their
role	when	they	get	a	worse	grade	than	they	expected.	Those	who 	see	a
bad	 grade	 as	 due	 to	 some	 personal	 flaw	 (“I’m	 stupid”) 	 feel	 more
depressed	than	those	who	explain	it	away	in	terms	of 	something	they
could	 change	 (“If	 I	 work	 harder	 on	 my	 math	 homework	 I’ ll	 get	 a
better	grade”). 31
Researchers	 identified	 a	 group	 of	 third,	 fourth,	 an d	 fifth	 graders
whom	classmates	had	rejected,	and	tracked	which	ones	 continued	to
be	 social	 outcasts	 in	 their	 new	 classes	 the	 followi ng	 year.	 How	 the
children	 explained	 the	 rejection	 to	 themselves	 seemed 	 crucial	 to
whether	they	became	depressed.	Those	who	saw	their	r ejection	as	due
to	some	flaw	in	themselves	grew	more	depressed.	But	th e	optimists,
who	felt	that	they	could	do	something	to	change	thin gs	for	the	better,
were	not	especially	depressed	despite	the	continuin g	rejection. 32	And
in	 a	 study	 of	 children	 making	 the	 notoriously	 stress ful	 transition	 to
seventh	 grade,	 those	 who	 had	 the	 pessimistic	 attitud e	 responded	 to
high	levels	of	hassles	at	school	and	to	any	additional	stress 	at	home	by
becoming	depressed. 33
The	most	direct	evidence	that	a	pessimistic	outlook	ma kes	children
highly	 susceptible	 to	 depression	 comes	 from	 a	 five-ye ar	 study	 of
children	 beginning	 when	 they	 were	 in	 third	 grade. 34	 Among	 the
younger	 children,	 the	 strongest	 predictor	 that	 they 	 would	 become
depressed	was	a	pessimistic	outlook	coupled	with	a	ma jor	blow	such
as	 parents	 divorcing	 or	 a	 death	 in	 the	 family,	 which 	 left	 the	 child
upset,	 unsettled,	 and,	 presumably,	 with	 parents	 less 	 able	 to	 offer	 a
nurturing	buffer.	As	the	children	grew	through	the	 elementary-school
years,	there	was	a	telling	shift	in	their	thinking	 about	the	good	and
bad	events	of	their	lives,	with	the	children	increa singly	ascribing	them
to	 their	 own	 traits:	 “I’m	 getting	 good	 grades	 becaus e	 I’m	 smart”;	 “I
don’t	have	many	friends	because	I’m	no	fun.”	This	shift	 seems	to	set	in
gradually	over	the	third	to	fifth	grades.	As	this	h appens	those	children
who	 develop	 a	 pessimistic	 outlook—attributing	 the	 set backs	 in	 their
lives	to	some	dire	flaw	in	themselves—begin	to	fall	pr ey	to	depressed

moods	 in	 reaction	 to	 setbacks.	 What’s	 more,	 the	 exper ience	 of
depression	itself	seems	to	reinforce	these	pessimisti c	ways	of	thinking,
so	 that	 even	 after	 the	 depression	 lifts,	 the	 child	 is	 left	 with	 what
amounts	 to	 an	 emotional	 scar,	 a	 set	 of	 convictions	 fe d	 by	 the
depression	and	solidified	in	the	mind:	that	he	can’t 	do	well	in	school,
is	unlikable,	and	can	do	nothing	to	escape	his	own	 brooding	moods.
These	 fixed	 ideas	 can	 make	 the	 child	 all	 the	 more	 vul nerable	 to
another	depression	down	the	road.
SHORT-CIRCUITING	DEPRESSION
The	 good	 news:	 there	 is	 every	 sign	 that	 teaching	 ch ildren	 more
productive	 ways	 of	 looking	 at	 their	 difficulties	 lo wers	 their	 risk	 of
depression. *	In	a	study	of	one	Oregon	high	school,	about	one	in 	four
students	 had	 what	 psychologists	 call	 a	 “low-level	 d epression,”	 not
severe	 enough	 to	 say	 it	 was	 beyond	 ordinary	 unhappi ness	 as	 yet. 35
Some	 may	 have	 been	 in	 the	 early	 weeks	 or	 months	 of	 wha t	 was	 to
become	a	depression.
In	a	special	after-school	class	seventy-five	of	the 	mildly	depressed
students	 learned	 to	 challenge	 the	 thinking	 patterns 	 associated	 with
depression,	 to	 become	 more	 adept	 at	 making	 friends,	 to 	 get	 along
better	with	their	parents,	and	to	engage	in	more	soc ial	activities	they
found	pleasant.	By	the	end	of	the	eight-week	progra m,	55	percent	of
the	 students	 had	 recovered	 from	 their	 mild	 depression ,	 while	 only
about	 a	 quarter	 of	 equally	 depressed	 students	 who	 w ere	 not	 in	 the
program	 had	 begun	 to	 pull	 out	 of	 their	 depression.	 A 	 year	 later	 a
quarter	of	those	in	the	comparison	group	had	gone	on 	to	fall	into	a
major	 depression,	 as	 opposed	 to	 only	 14	 percent	 of	 s tudents	 in	 the
depression-prevention	 program.	 Though	 they	 lasted	 ju st	 eight
sessions,	 the	 classes	 seemed	 to	 have	 cut	 the	 risk	 of 	 depression	 in
half. 36
Similarly	promising	findings	came	from	a	special	once-a -week	class
given	to	ten-	to	thirteen-year-old	youngsters	at	od ds	with	their	parents
and	 showing	 some	 signs	 of	 depression.	 In	 after-schoo l	 sessions	 they
learned	 some	 basic	 emotional	 skills,	 including	 handli ng
disagreements,	 thinking	 before	 acting,	 and,	 perhaps	 most	 important,
challenging	 the	 pessimistic	 beliefs	 associated	 with	 depression—for
example,	 resolving	 to	 study	 harder	 after	 doing	 poorl y	 on	 an	 exam
instead	of	thinking,	“I’m	just	not	smart	enough.”
======================================== [Página 271] ========================================

“What	 a	 child	 learns	 in	 these	 classes	 is	 that	 moods	 like	 anxiety,
sadness,	and	anger	don’t	just	descend	on	you	withou t	your	having	any
control	over	them,	but	that	you	can	change	the	way	y ou	feel	by	what
you	 think,”	 points	 out	 psychologist	 Martin	 Seligman, 	 one	 of	 the
developers	 of	 the	 twelve-week	 program.	 Because	 dispu ting	 the
depressing	 thoughts	 vanquishes	 the	 gathering	 mood	 of 	 gloom,
Seligman	added,	“it’s	an	instant	reinforcer	that	becomes	a	hab it.”
Again	 the	 special	 sessions	 lowered	 depression	 rates 	 by	 one	 half—
and	did	so	as	long	as	two	years	later.	A	year	after 	the	classes	ended,
just	 8	 percent	 of	 those	 who	 participated	 scored	 at	 a	 moderate-to-
severe	level	on	a	test	of	depression,	versus	29	per cent	of	children	in	a
comparison	group.	And	after	two	years,	about	20	perc ent	of	those	in
the	 course	 were	 showing	 some	 signs	 of	 at	 least	 mild	 d epression,
compared	to	44	percent	of	those	in	the	comparison	group.
Learning	these	emotional	skills	at	the	cusp	of	adole scence	may	be
especially	helpful,	Seligman	observes,	“These	kids	s eem	to	be	better	at
handling	the	routine	teenage	agonies	of	rejection.	 They	seem	to	have
learned	 this	 at	 a	 crucial	 window	 for	 risk	 of	 depres sion,	 just	 as	 they
enter	the	teen	years.	And	the	lesson	seems	to	persis t	and	grow	a	bit
stronger	over	the	course	of	the	years	after	they	le arn	it,	suggesting	the
kids	are	actually	using	it	in	their	day-to-day	lives.”
Other	experts	on	childhood	depression	applaud	the	n ew	programs.
“If	 you	 want	 to	 make	 a	 real	 difference	 for	 psychiatr ic	 illness	 like
depression,	you	have	to	do	something	before	the	kids 	get	sick	in	the
first	place,”	Kovacs	commented.	“The	real	solution	is 	a	psychological
inoculation.”
EATING	DISORDERS
During	 my	 days	 as	 a	 graduate	 student	 in	 clinical	 psy chology	 in	 the
late	 1960s,	 I	 knew	 two	 women	 who	 suffered	 from	 eatin g	 disorders,
though	I	realized	this	only	after	many	years	had	pas sed.	One	was	a
brilliant	 graduate	 student	 in	 mathematics	 at	 Harvard,	 a	 friend	 from
my	 undergraduate	 days;	 the	 other	 was	 on	 the	 staff	 at 	 M.I.T.	 The
mathematician,	though	skeletally	thin,	simply	could	no t	bring	herself
to	eat;	food,	she	said,	repulsed	her.	The	librarian 	had	an	ample	figure
and	 was	 given	 to	 bingeing	 on	 ice	 cream,	 Sara	 Lee	 car rot	 cake,	 and
other	desserts;	then—as	she	once	confided	with	some	e mbarrassment
—she	would	secretly	go	off	to	the	bathroom	and	make	he rself	vomit.
======================================== [Página 272] ========================================

Today	the	mathematician	would	be	diagnosed	with	anore xia	nervosa,
the	librarian	with	bulimia.
In	 those	 years	 there	 were	 no	 such	 labels.	 Clinician s	 were	 just
beginning	 to	 comment	 on	 the	 problem;	 Hilda	 Bruch,	 the	 p ioneer	 in
this	 movement,	 published	 her	 seminal	 article	 on	 eating 	 disorders	 in
1969. 37	 Bruch,	 puzzled	 by	 women	 who	 were	 starving	 themselves 	 to
death,	 proposed	 that	 one	 of	 the	 several	 underlying	 causes	 lay	 in	 an
inability	to	label	and	respond	appropriately	to	bod ily	urges—notably,
of	course,	hunger.	Since	then	the	clinical	literatu re	on	eating	disorders
has	 mushroomed,	 with	 a	 multitude	 of	 hypotheses	 about	 t he	 causes,
ranging	 from	 ever-younger	 girls	 feeling	 compelled	 to	 compete	 with
unattainably	 high	 standards	 of	 female	 beauty,	 to	 int rusive	 mothers
who	enmesh	their	daughters	in	a	controlling	web	of	guilt	and	bl ame.
Most	 of	 these	 hypotheses	 suffered	 from	 one	 great	 dra wback:	 they
were	extrapolations	from	observations	made	during	the rapy.	Far	more
desirable,	 from	 a	 scientific	 viewpoint,	 are	 studies	 of	 large	 groups	 of
people	 over	 a	 period	 of	 several	 years,	 to	 see	 who	 a mong	 them
eventually	comes	down	with	the	problem.	That	kind	of	 study	allows	a
clean	 comparison	 that	 can	 tell,	 for	 example,	 if	 havin g	 controlling
parents	 predisposes	 a	 girl	 to	 eating	 disorders.	 Bey ond	 that,	 it	 can
identify	 the	 cluster	 of	 conditions	 that	 leads	 to	 th e	 problem,	 and
distinguish	them	from	conditions	that	might	seem	to	be	 a	cause,	but
which	actually	are	found	as	often	in	people	without 	the	problem	as	in
those	who	come	for	treatment.
When	just	such	a	study	was	done	with	more	than	nine	 hundred	girls
in	the	seventh	through	tenth	grades,	emotional	defic its—particularly	a
failure	 to	 tell	 distressing	 feelings	 from	 one	 anothe r	 and	 to	 control
them—were	 found	 to	 be	 key	 among	 the	 factors	 leading	 to 	 eating
disorders. 38	 Even	 by	 tenth	 grade,	 there	 were	 sixty-one	 girls	 in 	 this
affluent,	suburban	Minneapolis	high	school	who	alre ady	had	serious
symptoms	of	anorexia	or	bulimia.	The	greater	the	probl em,	the	more
the	girls	reacted	to	setbacks,	difficulties,	and	min or	annoyances	with
intense	negative	feelings	that	they	could	not	sooth e,	and	the	less	their
awareness	 of	 what,	 exactly,	 they	 were	 feeling.	 When 	 these	 two
emotional	tendencies	were	coupled	with	being	highly	 dissatisfied	with
their	 body,	 then	 the	 outcome	 was	 anorexia	 or	 bulimia. 	 Overly
controlling	 parents	 were	 found	 not	 to	 play	 a	 prime	 r ole	 in	 causing
eating	 disorders.	 (As	 Bruch	 herself	 had	 warned,	 the ories	 based	 on
hindsight	were	unlikely	to	be	accurate;	for	example,	parents 	can	easily
become	 intensely	 controlling	 in	response 	 to	 their	 daughter’s	 eating
======================================== [Página 273] ========================================

disorder,	out	of	desperation	to	help	her.)	Also	jud ged	irrelevant	were
such	popular	explanations	as	fear	of	sexuality,	ear ly	onset	of	puberty,
and	low	self-esteem.
Instead,	the	causal	chain	this	prospective	study	re vealed	began	with
the	effects	on	young	girls	of	growing	up	in	a	societ y	preoccupied	with
unnatural	 thinness	 as	 a	 sign	 of	 female	 beauty.	 Well	 in	 advance	 of
adolescence,	girls	are	already	self-conscious	about 	their	weight.	One
six-year-old,	for	example,	broke	into	tears	when	her 	mother	asked	her
to	go	for	a	swim,	saying	she’d	look	fat	in	a	swimsuit .	In	fact,	says	her
pediatrician,	 who	 tells	 the	 story,	 her	 weight	 was	 n ormal	 for	 her
height. 39	In	one	study	of	271	young	teenagers,	half	the	girl s	thought
they	were	too	fat,	even	though	the	vast	majority	of	 them	were	normal
in	weight.	But	the	Minneapolis	study	showed	that	an 	obsession	with
being	overweight	is	not	in	and	of	itself	sufficient 	to	explain	why	some
girls	go	on	to	develop	eating	disorders.
Some	obese	people	are	unable	to	tell	the	difference	 between	being
scared,	angry,	and	hungry,	and	so	lump	all	those	fee lings	together	as
signifying	 hunger,	 which	 leads	 them	 to	 overeat	 whene ver	 they	 feel
upset. 40	 Something	 similar	 seems	 to	 be	 happening	 in	 these	 girl s.
Gloria	 Leon,	 the	 University	 of	 Minnesota	 psychologi st	 who	 did	 the
study	 of	 young	 girls	 and	 eating	 disorders,	 observed 	 that	 these	 girls
“have	poor	awareness	of	their	feelings	and	body	sig nals;	that	was	the
strongest	single	predictor	that	they	would	go	on	to 	develop	an	eating
disorder	within	the	next	two	years.	Most	children	l earn	to	distinguish
among	 their	 sensations,	 to	 tell	 if	 they’re	 feeling	 b ored,	 angry,
depressed,	 or	 hungry—it’s	 a	 basic	 part	 of	 emotional	 l earning.	 But
these	 girls	 have	 trouble	 distinguishing	 among	 their	 most	 basic
feelings.	They	may	have	a	problem	with	their	boyfrien d,	and	not	be
sure	 whether	 they’re	 angry,	 or	 anxious,	 or	 depresse d—they	 just
experience	a	diffuse	emotional	storm	that	they	do	not 	know	how	to
deal	 with	 effectively.	 Instead	 they	 learn	 to	 make	 th emselves	 feel
better	 by	 eating;	 that	 can	 become	 a	 strongly	 entrenc hed	 emotional
habit.”
But	 when	 this	 habit	 for	 soothing	 themselves	 interact s	 with	 the
pressures	girls	feel	to	stay	thin,	the	way	is	paved 	for	eating	disorders
to	develop.	“At	first	she	might	start	with	binge	eat ing,”	Leon	observes.
“But	 to	 stay	 thin	 she	 may	 turn	 to	 vomiting	 or	 laxativ es,	 or	 intense
physical	 exertion	 to	 undo	 the	 weight	 gain	 from	 overe ating.	 Another
avenue	this	struggle	to	handle	emotional	confusion	c an	take	is	for	the
girl	not	to	eat	at	all—it	can	be	a	way	to	feel	you	h ave	at	least	some
======================================== [Página 274] ========================================

control	over	these	overwhelming	feelings.”
The	 combination	 of	 poor	 inner	 awareness	 and	 weak	 soc ial	 skills
means	 that	 these	 girls,	 when	 upset	 by	 friends	 or	 par ents,	 fail	 to	 act
effectively	 to	 soothe	 either	 the	 relationship	 or	 th eir	 own	 distress.
Instead	their	upset	triggers	the	eating	disorder,	w hether	it	be	that	of
bulimia	or	anorexia,	or	simply	binge	eating.	Effectiv e	treatments	for
such	girls,	Leon	believes,	need	to	include	some	remed ial	instruction	in
the	emotional	skills	they	lack.	“Clinicians	find,”	s he	told	me,	“that	if
you	 address	 the	 deficits	 therapy	 works	 better.	 Thes e	 girls	 need	 to
learn	to	identify	their	feelings	and	learn	ways	to	 soothe	themselves	or
handle	their	relationships	better,	without	turning	 to	their	maladaptive
eating	habits	to	do	the	job.”
ONLY	THE	LONELY:	DROPOUTS
It’s	a	grade-school	drama:	Ben,	a	fourth	grader	with 	few	friends,	has
just	heard	from	his	one	buddy,	Jason,	that	they	aren ’t	going	to	play
together	 this	 lunch	 period—Jason	 wants	 to	 play	 with	 another	 boy,
Chad,	instead.	Ben,	crushed,	hangs	his	head	and	cri es.	After	his	sobs
subside,	Ben	goes	over	to	the	lunch	table	where	Jas on	and	Chad	are
eating.
“I	hate	your	guts!”	Ben	yells	at	Jason.
“Why?”	Jason	asks.
“Because	 you	 lied,”	 Ben	 says,	 his	 tone	 accusatory.	 “You	 said	 this
whole	week	that	you	were	gonna	play	with	me	and	you	lied.”
Ben	 then	 stalks	 off	 to	 his	 empty	 table,	 crying	 quiet ly.	 Jason	 and
Chad	go	over	to	him	and	try	to	talk	to	him,	but	Ben	p uts	his	fingers	in
his	ears,	determinedly	ignoring	them,	and	runs	out	of 	the	lunchroom
to	 hide	 behind	 the	 school	 Dumpster.	 A	 group	 of	 girls 	 who	 have
witnessed	 the	 exchange	 try	 to	 play	 a	 peacemaker	 role ,	 finding	 Ben
and	 telling	 him	 that	 Jason	 is	 willing	 to	 play	 with	 h im	 too.	 But	 Ben
will	have	none	of	it,	and	tells	them	to	leave	him	alo ne.	He	nurses	his
wounds,	sulking	and	sobbing,	defiantly	alone. 41
A	 poignant	 moment,	 to	 be	 sure;	 the	 feeling	 of	 being	 r ejected	 and
friendless	 is	 one	 most	 everyone	 goes	 through	 at	 some	 point	 in
childhood	 or	 adolescence.	 But	 what	 is	 most	 telling	 a bout	 Ben’s
reaction	 is	 his	 failure	 to	 respond	 to	 Jason’s	 effor ts	 to	 repair	 their
friendship,	a	stance	that	extends	his	plight	when	i t	might	have	ended.
Such	 an	 inability	 to	 seize	 key	 cues	 is	 typical	 of	 c hildren	 who	 are
======================================== [Página 275] ========================================

unpopular;	as	we	saw	in	 Chapter	8 ,	socially	rejected	children	typically
are	poor	at	reading	emotional	and	social	signals;	ev en	when	they	do
read	such	signals,	they	may	have	limited	repertoires	for	respo nse.
Dropping	 out	 of	 school	 is	 a	 particular	 risk	 for	 chi ldren	 who	 are
social	rejects.	The	dropout	rate	for	children	who	a re	rejected	by	their
peers	is	between	two	and	eight	times	greater	than	fo r	children	who
have	friends.	One	study	found,	for	example,	that	abo ut	25	percent	of
children	who	were	unpopular	in	elementary	school	had 	dropped	out
before	 completing	 high	 school,	 compared	 to	 a	 general	 rate	 of	 8
percent. 42	Small	wonder:	imagine	spending	thirty	hours	a	week	i n	a
place	where	no	one	likes	you.
Two	kinds	of	emotional	proclivities	lead	children	to	end	up	as 	social
outcasts.	 As	 we	 have	 seen,	 one	 is	 the	 propensity	 to 	 angry	 outbursts
and	to	perceive	hostility	even	where	none	is	intend ed.	The	second	is
being	 timid,	 anxious,	 and	 socially	 shy.	 But	 over	 and 	 above	 these
temperamental	 factors,	 it	 is	 children	 who	 are	 “off”—wh ose
awkwardness	 repeatedly	 makes	 people	 uncomfortable—who	 tend	 to
be	shunted	aside.
One	 way	 these	 children	 are	 “off”	 is	 in	 the	 emotional 	 signals	 they
send.	When	grade	schoolers	with	few	friends	were	as ked	to	match	an
emotion	such	as	disgust	or	anger	with	faces	that	dis played	a	range	of
emotions,	 they	 made	 far	 more	 mismatches	 than	 did	 childre n	 who
were	popular.	When	kindergarteners	were	asked	to	ex plain	ways	they
might	make	friends	with	someone	or	keep	from	having	a	f ight,	it	was
the	 unpopular	 children—the	 ones	 others	 shied	 away	 fr om	 playing
with—who	 came	 up	 with	 self-defeating	 answers	 (“Punch	 him”	 for
what	to	do	when	both	children	wanted	the	same	toy,	f or	example),	or
vague	 appeals	 for	 help	 from	 a	 grown-up.	 And	 when	 tee nagers	 were
asked	 to	 role-play	 being	 sad,	 angry,	 or	 mischievous, 	 the	 more
unpopular	among	them	gave	the	least	convincing	perfor mances.	It	is
perhaps	 no	 surprise	 that	 such	 children	 come	 to	 feel	 that	 they	 are
helpless	to	do	any	better	at	making	friends;	their	s ocial	incompetence
becomes	a	self-fulfilling	prophecy.	Instead	of	learn ing	new	approaches
to	making	friends,	they	simply	keep	doing	the	same	thi ngs	that	have
not	 worked	 for	 them	 in	 the	 past,	 or	 come	 up	 with	 even 	 more	 inept
responses. 43
In	the	lottery	of	liking,	these	children	fall	short 	on	key	emotional
criteria:	they	are	not	seen	as	fun	to	be	with,	and	 they	don’t	know	how
to	make	another	child	feel	good.	Observations	of	unp opular	children
at	play	show,	for	example,	that	they	are	much	more	lik ely	than	others
======================================== [Página 276] ========================================

to	cheat,	sulk,	quit	when	losing,	or	show	off	and	b rag	about	winning.
Of	 course,	 most	 children	 want	 to	 win	 at	 a	 game—but	 win 	 or	 lose,
most	children	are	able	to	contain	their	emotional	rea ction	so	that	it
does	not	undermine	the	relationship	with	the	friend	 they	play	games
with.
While	 children	 who	 are	 socially	 tone-deaf—who	 contin ually	 have
trouble	 reading	 and	 responding	 to	 emotions—end	 up	 as	 social
isolates,	this	does	not	apply,	of	course,	to	childr en	who	go	through	a
temporary	period	of	feeling	left	out.	But	for	those	 who	are	continually
excluded	 and	 rejected,	 their	 painful	 outcast	 status 	 clings	 to	 them	 as
they	 continue	 their	 school	 years.	 The	 consequences	 of	 ending	 up	 at
the	social	margins	are	potentially	great	as	a	child	 continues	on	into
adulthood.	For	one,	it	is	in	the	cauldron	of	close	 friendships	and	the
tumult	of	play	that	children	refine	the	social	and	e motional	skills	that
they	 will	 bring	 to	 relationships	 later	 in	 life.	 Chi ldren	 who	 are
excluded	from	this	realm	of	learning	are,	inevitably,	disadva ntaged.
Understandably,	 those	 who	 are	 rejected	 report	 great 	 anxiety	 and
many	 worries,	 as	 well	 as	 being	 depressed	 and	 lonely. 	 In	 fact,	 how
popular	 a	 child	 was	 in	 third	 grade	 has	 been	 shown	 t o	 be	 a	 better
predictor	 of	 mental-health	 problems	 at	 age	 eighteen	 t han	 anything
else—teachers’	and	nurses’	ratings,	school	performanc e	and	IQ,	even
scores	on	psychological	tests. 44	And,	as	we	have	seen,	in	later	stages
of	life	people	who	have	few	friends	and	are	chronic ally	lonely	are	at
greater	risk	for	medical	diseases	and	an	early	death.
As	psychoanalyst	Harry	Stack	Sullivan	pointed	out,	w e	learn	how	to
negotiate	 intimate	 relations—to	 work	 out	 differences	 and	 share	 our
deepest	feelings—in	our	first	close	friendships	with 	same-sex	chums.
But	children	who	are	socially	rejected	are	only	hal f	as	likely	as	their
peers	 to	 have	 a	 best	 friend	 during	 the	 crucial	 year s	 of	 elementary
school,	and	so	miss	out	on	one	of	the	essential	chan ces	for	emotional
growth. 45	One	friend	can	make	the	difference—even	when	all	oth ers
turn	their	backs	(and	even	when	that	friendship	is	not	all	tha t	solid).
COACHING	FOR	FRIENDSHIP
There	 is	 hope	 for	 rejected	 children,	 despite	 their	 ineptness.	 Steven
Asher,	 a	 University	 of	 Illinois	 psychologist,	 has	 d esigned	 a	 series	 of
“friendship	coaching”	sessions	for	unpopular	childr en	that	has	shown
some	 success. 46	 Identifying	 third	 and	 fourth	 graders	 who	 were	 the
======================================== [Página 277] ========================================

least	 liked	 in	 their	 classes,	 Asher	 gave	 them	 six	 se ssions	 in	 how	 to
“make	 playing	 games	 more	 fun”	 through	 being	 “friendly, 	 fun,	 and
nice.”	To	avoid	stigma,	the	children	were	told	that	 they	were	acting	as
“consultants”	 to	 the	 coach,	 who	 was	 trying	 to	 learn 	 what	 kinds	 of
things	make	it	more	enjoyable	to	play	games.
The	children	were	coached	to	act	in	ways	Asher	had	 found	typical
of	more	popular	children.	For	example,	they	were	enco uraged	to	think
of	 alternative	 suggestions	 and	 compromises	 (rather	 th an	 fighting)	 if
they	 disagree	 about	 the	 rules;	 to	 remember	 to	 talk	 wi th	 and	 ask
questions	about	the	other	child	while	they	play;	to 	listen	and	look	at
the	other	child	to	see	how	he’s	doing;	to	say	someth ing	nice	when	the
other	 person	 does	 well;	 to	 smile	 and	 offer	 help	 or	 s uggestions	 and
encouragement.	 The	 children	 also	 tried	 out	 these	 bas ic	 social
amenities	 while	 playing	 games	 such	 as	 Pick-up	 Sticks	 w ith	 a
classmate,	 and	 were	 coached	 afterward	 on	 how	 well	 th ey	 did.	 This
minicourse	in	getting	along	had	a	remarkable	effect:	 a	year	later	the
children	who	were	coached—all	of	whom	were	selected	b ecause	they
were	the	least-liked	in	their	class—were	now	solidly 	in	the	middle	of
classroom	popularity.	None	were	social	stars,	but	none	were	r ejects.
Similar	 results	 have	 been	 found	 by	 Stephen	 Nowicki,	 an	 Emory
University	psychologist. 47	His	program	trains	social	outcasts	to	hone
their	 ability	 to	 read	 and	 respond	 appropriately	 to	 other	 children’s
feelings.	 The	 children,	 for	 example,	 are	 videotaped	 while	 practicing
expression	of	feelings	such	as	happiness	and	sadnes s,	and	are	coached
to	 improve	 their	 emotional	 expressiveness.	 They	 then	 try	 out	 their
newly	honed	skills	with	a	child	they	want	to	make	friends	with.
Such	 programs	 have	 reported	 a	 50	 to	 60	 percent	 succe ss	 rate	 in
raising	the	popularity	of	rejected	children.	These	 programs	(at	least	as
presently	 designed)	 seem	 to	 work	 best	 for	 third	 and	 fourth	 graders
rather	 than	 children	 in	 higher	 grades,	 and	 to	 be	 mor e	 helpful	 for
socially	inept	children	than	for	highly	aggressive	 ones.	But	that	is	all	a
matter	for	fine-tuning;	the	hopeful	sign	is	that	many 	or	most	rejected
children	can	be	brought	into	the	circle	of	friendsh ip	with	some	basic
emotional	coaching.
DRINKING	AND	DRUGS:	ADDICTION	AS	SELF-MEDICATION
Students	at	the	local	campus	call	it	 drinking	to	black —bingeing	on	beer
to	the	point	of	passing	out.	One	of	the	techniques: 	attach	a	funnel	to	a
======================================== [Página 278] ========================================

garden	 hose,	 so	 that	 a	 can	 of	 beer	 can	 be	 downed	 in 	 about	 ten
seconds.	The	method	is	not	an	isolated	oddity.	One	s urvey	found	that
two	 fifths	 of	 male	 college	 students	 down	 seven	 or	 mor e	 drinks	 at	 a
time,	 while	 11	 percent	 call	 themselves	 “heavy	 drinker s.”	 Another
term,	 of	 course,	 might	 be	 “alcoholics.” 48	 About	 half	 of	 college	 men
and	 almost	 40	 percent	 of	 women	 have	 at	 least	 two	 bing e-drinking
episodes	in	a	month. 49
While	in	the	United	States	use	of	most	drugs	among	yo ung	people
generally	 tapered	 off	 in	 the	 1980s,	 there	 is	 a	 stea dy	 trend	 toward
more	alcohol	use	at	ever-younger	ages.	A	1993	survey 	found	that	35
percent	of	college	women	said	they	drank	to	get	drun k,	while	just	10
percent	 did	 so	 in	 1977;	 overall,	 one	 in	 three	 stude nts	 drinks	 to	 get
drunk.	 That	 poses	 other	 risks:	 90	 percent	 of	 all	 ra pes	 reported	 on
college	campuses	happened	when	either	the	assailant	 or	the	victim—
or	 both—had	 been	 drinking. 50	 Alcohol-related	 accidents	 are	 the
leading	 cause	 of	 death	 among	 young	 people	 between	 fi fteen	 and
twenty-four. 51
Experimentation	 with	 drugs	 and	 alcohol	 might	 seem	 a	 ri te	 of
passage	 for	 adolescents,	 but	 this	 first	 taste	 can	 h ave	 long-lasting
results	for	some.	For	most	alcoholics	and	drug	abuser s,	the	beginnings
of	 addiction	 can	 be	 traced	 to	 their	 teen	 years,	 tho ugh	 few	 of	 those
who	so	experiment	end	up	as	alcoholics	or	drug	abuse rs.	By	the	time
students	 leave	 high	 school,	 over	 90	 percent	 have	 tr ied	 alcohol,	 yet
only	about	14	percent	eventually	become	alcoholics;	 of	the	millions	of
Americans	 who	 experimented	 with	 cocaine,	 fewer	 than	 5 	 percent
became	addicted. 52	What	makes	the	difference?
To	be	sure,	those	living	in	high-crime	neighborhoods ,	where	crack
is	sold	on	the	corner	and	the	drug	dealer	is	the	mos t	prominent	local
model	of	economic	success,	are	most	at	risk	for	substa nce	abuse.	Some
may	 end	 up	 addicted	 through	 becoming	 small-time	 dealers
themselves,	others	simply	because	of	the	easy	access	 or	a	peer	culture
that	glamorizes	drugs—a	factor	that	heightens	the	ris k	of	drug	use	in
any	 neighborhood,	 even	 (and	 perhaps	 especially)	 the 	 most	 well-off.
But	still	the	question	remains,	of	the	pool	of	those 	exposed	to	these
lures	 and	 pressures,	 and	 who	 go	 on	 to	 experiment,	 wh ich	 ones	 are
most	likely	to	end	up	with	a	lasting	habit?
One	current	scientific	theory	is	that	those	who	sta y	with	the	habit,
becoming	increasingly	dependent	on	alcohol	or	drugs, 	are	using	these
substances	 as	 a	 medication	 of	 sorts,	 a	 way	 to	 soothe 	 feelings	 of
anxiety,	 anger,	 or	 depression.	 Through	 their	 early	 experimentation
======================================== [Página 279] ========================================

they	hit	upon	a	chemical	fix,	a	way	to	calm	the	feeli ngs	of	anxiety	or
melancholy	 that	 have	 tormented	 them.	 Thus	 of	 several	 h undred
seventh-	and	eighth-grade	students	tracked	for	two	 years,	it	was	those
who	 reported	 higher	 levels	 of	 emotional	 distress	 who 	 subsequently
went	 on	 to	 have	 the	 highest	 rates	 of	 substance	 abus e.53	 This	 may
explain	why	so	many	young	people	are	able	to	experime nt	with	drugs
and	 drinking	 without	 becoming	 addicted,	 while	 others 	 become
dependent	almost	from	the	start:	those	most	vulnerable 	to	addiction
seem	to	find	in	the	drug	or	alcohol	an	instant	way	t o	soothe	emotions
that	have	distressed	them	for	years.
As	Ralph	Tarter,	a	psychologist	at	the	Western	Psyc hiatric	Institute
and	 Clinic	 in	 Pittsburgh,	 put	 it,	 “For	 people	 who	 a re	 biologically
predisposed,	the	first	drink	or	dose	of	a	drug	is	imme nsely	reinforcing,
in	a	way	others	just	don’t	experience.	Many	recover ing	drug	abusers
tell	me,	‘The	moment	I	took	my	first	drug,	I	felt	normal 	for	the	first
time.’	It	stabilizes	them	physiologically,	at	least	i n	the	short	term.” 54
That,	of	course,	is	the	devil’s	bargain	of	addictio n:	a	short-term	good
feeling	in	exchange	for	the	steady	meltdown	of	one’s	life.
Certain	emotional	patterns	seem	to	make	people	more	lik ely	to	find
emotional	 relief	 in	 one	 substance	 rather	 than	 anothe r.	 For	 example,
there	 are	 two	 emotional	 pathways	 to	 alcoholism.	 One	 s tarts	 with
someone	 who	 was	 high-strung	 and	 anxious	 in	 childhood ,	 who
typically	 discovers	 as	 a	 teenager	 that	 alcohol	 will 	 calm	 the	 anxiety.
Very	 often	 they	 are	 children—usually	 sons—of	 alcoholi cs	 who
themselves	 have	 turned	 to	 alcohol	 to	 soothe	 their	 ne rves.	 One
biological	 marker	 for	 this	 pattern	 is	 undersecretion 	 of	 GABA,	 a
neurotransmitter	 that	 regulates	 anxiety—too	 little	 GA BA	 is
experienced	as	a	high	level	of	tension.	One	study	f ound	that	sons	of
alcoholic	fathers	had	low	levels	of	GABA	and	were	h ighly	anxious,	but
when	 they	 drank	 alcohol,	 their	 GABA	 levels	 rose	 as	 their	 anxiety
fell. 55	These	sons	of	alcoholics	drink	to	ease	their	tensi on,	finding	in
alcohol	a	relaxation	that	they	could	not	seem	to	get 	otherwise.	Such
people	may	be	vulnerable	to	abusing	sedatives	as	wel l	as	alcohol	for
the	same	anxiety-reduction	effect.
A	neuropsychological	study	of	sons	of	alcoholics	wh o	at	age	twelve
showed	signs	of	anxiety	such	as	a	heightened	heart	 rate	in	response	to
stress,	 as	 well	 as	 impulsivity,	 found	 the	 boys	 also	 had	 poor	 frontal
lobe	functioning. 56	Thus	the	brain	areas	that	might	have	helped	ease
their	 anxiety	 or	 control	 their	 impulsiveness	 brought 	 them	 less	 help
than	 in	 other	 boys.	 And	 since	 the	 pre-frontal	 lobes 	 also	 handle
======================================== [Página 280] ========================================

working	memory—which	holds	in	mind	the	consequences	of	 various
routes	of	action	while	making	a	decision—their	deficit	could	s upport	a
slide	into	alcoholism	by	helping	them	ignore	the	long -term	drawbacks
of	drinking,	even	as	they	found	an	immediate	sedation 	from	anxiety
through	alcohol.
This	craving	for	calm	seems	to	be	an	emotional	marker	o f	a	genetic
susceptibility	to	alcoholism.	A	study	of	thirteen	hu ndred	relatives	of
alcoholics	found	that	the	children	of	alcoholics	wh o	were	most	at	risk
for	becoming	alcoholics	themselves	were	those	who	rep orted	having
chronically	high	levels	of	anxiety.	Indeed,	the	res earchers	concluded
that	alcoholism	develops	in	such	people	as	“self-medi cation	of	anxiety
symptoms.” 57
A	second	emotional	pathway	to	alcoholism	comes	from	a	h igh	level
of	 agitation,	 impulsivity,	 and	 boredom.	 This	 pattern	 shows	 up	 in
infancy	as	being	restless,	cranky,	and	hard	to	hand le,	in	grade	school
as	 having	 the	 “fidgets,”	 hyperactivity,	 and	 getting 	 into	 trouble,	 a
propensity	that,	as	we	have	seen,	can	push	such	chi ldren	to	seek	out
friends	on	the	fringe—sometimes	leading	to	a	criminal	c areer	or	the
diagnosis	of	“antisocial	personality	disorder.”	Suc h	people	(and	they
are	 mainly	 men)	 have	 as	 their	 main	 emotional	 complaint	 a gitation;
their	main	weakness	is	unrestrained	impulsivity;	thei r	usual	reaction
to	 boredom—which	 they	 often	 feel—is	 an	 impulsive	 search 	 for	 risk
and	 excitement.	 As	 adults,	 people	 with	 this	 pattern	 (which	 may	 be
tied	 to	 deficiencies	 in	 two	 other	 neurotransmitters, 	 serotonin	 and
MAO)	find	that	alcohol	can	soothe	their	agitation.	 And	the	fact	that
they	can’t	stand	monotony	makes	them	ready	to	try	anyt hing;	coupled
with	 their	 general	 impulsivity,	 it	 makes	 them	 prone	 to 	 abusing	 an
almost	random	list	of	drugs	besides	alcohol. 58
While	depression	can	drive	some	to	drink,	the	metabol ic	effects	of
alcohol	often	simply	worsen	the	depression	after	a	s hort	lift.	People
who	turn	to	alcohol	as	an	emotional	palliative	do	s o	much	more	often
to	 calm	 anxiety	 than	 for	 depression;	 an	 entirely	 dif ferent	 class	 of
drugs	 soothes	 the	 feelings	 of	 people	 who	 are	 depres sed—at	 least
temporarily.	Feeling	chronically	unhappy	puts	people 	at	greater	risk
for	 addiction	 to	 stimulants	 such	 as	 cocaine,	 which	 p rovide	 a	 direct
antidote	to	feeling	depressed.	One	study	found	that 	more	than	half	the
patients	 being	 treated	 at	 a	 clinic	 for	 cocaine	 addi ction	 would	 have
been	diagnosed	with	severe	depression	before	they	s tarted	their	habit,
and	the	deeper	the	preceding	depression,	the	stronger	the	ha bit.59
Chronic	anger	may	lead	to	still	another	kind	of	susc eptibility.	In	a
======================================== [Página 281] ========================================

study	of	four	hundred	patients	being	treated	for	ad diction	to	heroin
and	other	opioids,	the	most	striking	emotional	patter n	was	a	lifelong
difficulty	handling	anger	and	a	quickness	to	rage.	Some	of	the 	patients
themselves	 said	 that	 with	 opiates	 they	 finally	 felt	 normal	 and
relaxed. 60
Though	the	predisposition	to	substance	abuse	may,	in 	many	cases,
be	 brain-based,	 the	 feelings	 that	 drive	 people	 to	 “ self-medicate”
themselves	through	drink	or	drugs	can	be	handled	wit hout	recourse	to
medication,	 as	 Alcoholics	 Anonymous	 and	 other	 recover y	 programs
have	demonstrated	for	decades.	Acquiring	the	ability 	to	handle	those
feelings—soothing	anxiety,	lifting	depression,	calmin g	rage—removes
the	 impetus	 to	 use	 drugs	 or	 alcohol	 in	 the	 first	 pla ce.	 These	 basic
emotional	skills	are	taught	remedially	in	treatment	pr ograms	for	drug
and	 alcohol	 abuse.	 It	 would	 be	 far	 better,	 of	 cours e,	 if	 they	 were
learned	early	in	life,	well	before	the	habit	became	establish ed.
NO	MORE	WARS:	A	FINAL	COMMON	PREVENTIVE	PATHWAY
Over	the	last	decade	or	so	“wars”	have	been	proclai med,	in	turn,	on
teen	pregnancy,	dropping	out,	drugs,	and	most	recent ly	violence.	The
trouble	with	such	campaigns,	though,	is	that	they	co me	too	late,	after
the	 targeted	 problem	 has	 reached	 epidemic	 proportions 	 and	 taken
firm	root	in	the	lives	of	the	young.	They	are	crisis 	intervention,	the
equivalent	 of	 solving	 a	 problem	 by	 sending	 an	 ambulan ce	 to	 the
rescue	 rather	 than	 giving	 an	 inoculation	 that	 would 	 ward	 off	 the
disease	in	the	first	place.	Instead	of	more	such	“wa rs,”	what	we	need
is	to	follow	the	logic	of	prevention,	offering	our	 children	the	skills	for
facing	life	that	will	increase	their	chances	of	avo iding	any	and	all	of
these	fates. 61
My	focus	on	the	place	of	emotional	and	social	defici ts	is	not	to	deny
the	 role	 of	 other	 risk	 factors,	 such	 as	 growing	 up	 in	 a	 fragmented,
abusive,	 or	 chaotic	 family,	 or	 in	 an	 impoverished,	 cr ime-	 and	 drug-
ridden	 neighborhood.	 Poverty	 itself	 delivers	 emotion al	 blows	 to
children:	poorer	children	at	age	five	are	already	mo re	fearful,	anxious,
and	sad	than	their	better-off	peers,	and	have	more	b ehavior	problems
such	 as	 frequent	 tantrums	 and	 destroying	 things,	 a	 t rend	 that
continues	through	the	teen	years.	The	press	of	poverty	corro des	family
life	too:	there	tend	to	be	fewer	expressions	of	par ental	warmth,	more
depression	 in	 mothers	 (who	 are	 often	 single	 and	 jobl ess),	 and	 a
======================================== [Página 282] ========================================

greater	 reliance	 on	 harsh	 punishments	 such	 as	 yellin g,	 hitting,	 and
physical	threats. 62
But	there	is	a	role	that	emotional	competence	plays	o ver	and	above
family	 and	 economic	 forces—it	 may	 be	 decisive	 in	 determi ning	 the
extent	 to	 which	 any	 given	 child	 or	 teenager	 is	 undo ne	 by	 these
hardships	 or	 finds	 a	 core	 of	 resilience	 to	 survive	 them.	 Long-term
studies	 of	 hundreds	 of	 children	 brought	 up	 in	 pover ty,	 in	 abusive
families,	 or	 by	 a	 parent	 with	 severe	 mental	 illness	 s how	 that	 those
who	are	resilient	even	in	the	face	of	the	most	grind ing	hardships	tend
to	 share	 key	 emotional	 skills. 63	 These	 include	 a	 winning	 sociability
that	draws	people	to	them,	self-confidence,	an	optimi stic	persistence
in	 the	 face	 of	 failure	 and	 frustration,	 the	 ability 	 to	 recover	 quickly
from	upsets,	and	an	easygoing	nature.
But	the	vast	majority	of	children	face	such	difficul ties	without	these
advantages.	 Of	 course,	 many	 of	 these	 skills	 are	 inna te,	 the	 luck	 of
genes—but	even	qualities	of	temperament	can	change	for 	the	better,
as	 we	 saw	 in	 Chapter	 14 .	 One	 line	 of	 intervention,	 of	 course,	 is
political	 and	 economic,	 alleviating	 the	 poverty	 and	 other	 social
conditions	 that	 breed	 these	 problems.	 But	 apart	 from	 these	 tactics
(which	seem	to	move	ever	lower	on	the	social	agenda)	 there	is	much
that	can	be	offered	to	children	to	help	them	grapple 	better	with	such
debilitating	hardships.
Take	the	case	of	emotional	disorders,	afflictions	th at	about	one	in
two	 Americans	 experiences	 over	 the	 course	 of	 life.	 A 	 study	 of	 a
representative	 sample	 of	 8,098	 Americans	 found	 that	 4 8	 percent
suffered	from	at	least	one	psychiatric	problem	during 	their	lifetime. 64
Most	severely	affected	were	the	14	percent	of	peopl e	who	developed
three	or	more	psychiatric	problems	at	once.	This	grou p	was	the	most
troubled,	 accounting	 for	 60	 percent	 of	 all	 psychiat ric	 disorders
occurring	 at	 any	 one	 time,	 and	 90	 percent	 of	 the	 most 	 severe	 and
disabling	 ones.	 While	 they	 need	 intensive	 care	 now, 	 the	 optimal
approach	would	be,	wherever	possible,	to	prevent	th ese	problems	in
the	first	place.	To	be	sure,	not	every	mental	disord er	can	be	prevented
—but	there	are	some,	and	perhaps	many,	that	can.	Ronal d	Kessler,	the
University	 of	 Michigan	 sociologist	 who	 did	 the	 stud y,	 told	 me,	 “We
need	 to	 intervene	 early	 in	 life.	 Take	 a	 young	 girl	 who	 has	 a	 social
phobia	in	the	sixth	grade,	and	starts	drinking	in	j unior	high	school	to
handle	her	social	anxieties.	By	her	late	twenties,	 when	she	shows	up
in	our	study,	she’s	still	fearful,	has	become	both	a n	alcohol	and	drug
abuser,	 and	 is	 depressed	 because	 her	 life	 is	 so	 mess ed	 up.	 The	 big
======================================== [Página 283] ========================================

question	is,	what	could	we	have	done	early	in	her	l ife	to	have	headed
off	the	whole	downward	spiral?”
The	same	holds,	of	course,	for	dropping	out	or	viole nce,	or	most	of
the	 litany	 of	 perils	 faced	 by	 young	 people	 today.	 E ducational
programs	to	prevent	one	or	another	specific	problem	s uch	as	drug	use
and	violence	have	proliferated	wildly	in	the	last	d ecade	or	so,	creating
a	mini-industry	within	the	education	marketplace.	But 	many	of	them
—including	many	of	the	most	slickly	marketed	and	most	wi dely	used
—have	proven	to	be	ineffective.	A	few,	to	the	chagri n	of	educators,
even	 seemed	 to	 increase	 the	 likelihood	 of	 the	 proble ms	 they	 were
meant	to	head	off,	particularly	drug	abuse	and	teen	sex.
Information	Is	Not	Enough
An	instructive	case	in	point	is	sexual	abuse	of	chi ldren.	As	of	1993,
about	 two	 hundred	 thousand	 substantiated	 cases	 were 	 reported
annually	in	the	United	States,	with	that	number	grow ing	by	about	10
percent	per	year.	And	while	estimates	vary	widely,	mo st	experts	agree
that	between	20	and	30	percent	of	girls	and	about	h alf	that	number	of
boys	are	victims	of	some	form	of	sexual	abuse	by	age	s eventeen	(the
figures	rise	or	fall	depending	on	how	sexual	abuse	 is	defined,	among
other	 factors). 65	 There	 is	 no	 single	 profile	 of	 a	 child	 who	 is
particularly	 vulnerable	 to	 sexual	 abuse,	 but	 most	 fe el	 unprotected,
unable	to	resist	on	their	own,	and	isolated	by	what 	has	happened	to
them.
With	 these	 risks	 in	 mind,	 many	 schools	 have	 begun	 to	 offer
programs	 to	 prevent	 sexual	 abuse.	 Most	 such	 programs	 are	 tightly
focused	 on	 basic	 information	 about	 sexual	 abuse,	 tea ching	 kids,	 for
example,	to	know	the	difference	between	“good”	and	“ bad”	touching,
alerting	them	to	the	dangers,	and	encouraging	them	to 	tell	an	adult	if
anything	 untoward	 happens	 to	 them.	 But	 a	 national	 su rvey	 of	 two
thousand	children	found	that	this	basic	training	wa s	little	better	than
nothing—or	 actually	 worse	 than	 nothing—in	 helping	 chi ldren	 do
something	to	prevent	being	victimized,	whether	by	a	s chool	bully	or	a
potential	 child	 molester. 66	 Worse,	 the	 children	 who	 had	 only	 such
basic	programs	and	who	had	subsequently	become	victims 	of	sexual
assault	 were	 actually	 half	 as	 likely	 to	 report	 it	 afterward	 than	 were
children	who	had	had	no	programs	at	all.
By	 contrast,	 children	 given	 more	 comprehensive	 traini ng—
including	related	emotional	and	social	competences—wer e	better	able
======================================== [Página 284] ========================================

to	protect	themselves	against	the	threat	of	being	vi ctimized:	they	were
far	 more	 likely	 to	 demand	 to	 be	 left	 alone,	 to	 yell	 o r	 fight	 back,	 to
threaten	to	tell,	and	to	actually	tell	if	something	 bad	did	happen	to
them.	This	last	benefit—reporting	the	abuse—is	prevent ive	in	a	telling
sense:	many	child	molesters	victimize	hundreds	of	children.	A	s tudy	of
child	molesters	in	their	forties	found	that,	on	aver age,	they	had	one
victim	a	month	since	their	teenage	years.	A	report	on 	a	bus	driver	and
a	 high-school	 computer	 teacher	 reveals	 they	 molested	 about	 three
hundred	 children	 each	 year	 between	 them—yet	 not	 one	 o f	 the
children	reported	the	sexual	abuse;	the	abuse	came	t o	light	only	after
one	 of	 the	 boys	 who	 had	 been	 abused	 by	 the	 teacher	 started	 to
sexually	abuse	his	sister. 67
Those	 children	 who	 got	 the	 more	 comprehensive	 programs 	 were
three	 times	 more	 likely	 than	 those	 in	 minimal	 programs	 t o	 report
abuse.	 What	 worked	 so	 well?	 These	 programs	 were	 not	 one-shot
topics,	but	were	given	at	different	levels	several	 times	over	the	course
of	 a	 child’s	 school	 career,	 as	 part	 of	 health	 or	 se x	 education.	 They
enlisted	parents	to	deliver	the	message	to	the	child 	along	with	what
was	taught	in	school	(children	whose	parents	did	th is	were	the	very
best	at	resisting	threats	of	sexual	abuse).
Beyond	 that,	 social	 and	 emotional	 competences	 made	 the
difference.	It	is	not	enough	for	a	child	simply	to	k now	about	“good”
and	“bad”	touching;	children	need	the	self-awarenes s	to	know	when	a
situation	feels	 wrong	 or	 distressing	 long	 before	 the	 touching	 begi ns.
This	 entails	 not	 just	 self-awareness,	 but	 also	 enou gh	 self-confidence
and	assertiveness	to	trust	and	act	on	those	feeling s	of	distress,	even	in
the	face	of	an	adult	who	may	be	trying	to	reassure	her	that	“it’ s	okay.”
And	then	a	child	needs	a	repertoire	of	ways	to	disr upt	what	is	about
to	happen—everything	from	running	away	to	threatening 	to	tell.	For
these	reasons,	the	better	programs	teach	children	to 	stand	up	for	what
they	want,	to	assert	their	rights	rather	than	be	pa ssive,	to	know	what
their	boundaries	are	and	defend	them.
The	most	effective	programs,	then,	supplemented	the	ba sic	sexual-
abuse	 information	 with	 essential	 emotional	 and	 social 	 skills.	 These
programs	taught	children	to	find	ways	to	solve	inter personal	conflicts
more	 positively,	 to	 have	 more	 self-confidence,	 not	 to 	 blame
themselves	if	something	happened,	and	to	feel	they	ha d	a	network	of
support	 in	 teachers	 and	 parents	 whom	 they	 could	 turn 	 to.	 And	 if
something	bad	did	happen	to	them,	they	were	far	more	likely	to	tel l.
======================================== [Página 285] ========================================

The	Active	Ingredients
Such	findings	have	led	to	a	reenvisioning	of	what	t he	ingredients	of
an	 optimal	 prevention	 program	 should	 be,	 based	 on	 tho se	 that
impartial	 evaluations	 showed	 to	 be	 truly	 effective.	 In	 a	 five-year
project	 sponsored	 by	 the	 W.	 T.	 Grant	 Foundation,	 a	 consortium	 of
researchers	studied	this	landscape	and	distilled	th e	active	ingredients
that	seemed	crucial	to	the	success	of	those	programs	 that	worked. 68
The	list	of	key	skills	the	consortium	concluded	shou ld	be	covered,	no
matter	what	specific	problem	it	is	designed	to	preven t,	reads	like	the
ingredients	 of	 emotional	 intelligence	 (see	 Appendix	 D 	 for	 the	 full
list). 69
The	emotional	skills	include	self-awareness;	identif ying,	expressing,
and	 managing	 feelings;	 impulse	 control	 and	 delaying	 g ratification;
and	 handling	 stress	 and	 anxiety.	 A	 key	 ability	 in	 i mpulse	 control	 is
knowing	the	difference	between	feelings	and	actions ,	and	learning	to
make	 better	 emotional	 decisions	 by	 first	 controlling	 the	 impulse	 to
act,	then	identifying	alternative	actions	and	their 	consequences	before
acting.	 Many	 competences	 are	 interpersonal:	 reading	 social	 and
emotional	 cues,	 listening,	 being	 able	 to	 resist	 nega tive	 influences,
taking	 others’	 perspectives,	 and	 understanding	 what 	 behavior	 is
acceptable	in	a	situation.
These	are	among	the	core	emotional	and	social	skills	 for	life,	and
include	at	least	partial	remedies	for	most,	if	not	al l,	of	the	difficulties	I
have	discussed	in	this	chapter.	The	choice	of	speci fic	problems	these
skills	might	inoculate	against	is	nearly	arbitrary—si milar	cases	for	the
role	of	emotional	and	social	competences	could	have	b een	made	for,
say,	unwanted	teen	pregnancy	or	teen	suicide.
To	 be	 sure,	 the	 causes	 of	 all	 such	 problems	 are	 compl ex,
interweaving	 differing	 ratios	 of	 biological	 destiny ,	 family	 dynamics,
the	politics	of	poverty,	and	the	culture	of	the	str eets.	No	single	kind	of
intervention,	 including	 one	 targeting	 emotions,	 can	 claim	 to	 do	 the
whole	job.	But	to	the	degree	emotional	deficits	add	 to	a	child’s	risk—
and	we	have	seen	that	they	add	a	great	deal—attentio n	must	be	paid
to	 emotional	 remedies,	 not	 to	 the	 exclusion	 of	 other	 answers,	 but
along	with	them.	 The	next	question	 is,	what	would	 an 	education	in
the	emotions	look	like?

Schooling	the	Emotions
The	main	hope	of	a	nation	lies	in	the	proper	educatio n	of	its	youth .
—ERASMUS
It’s	a	strange	roll	call,	going	around	the	circle	o f	fifteen	fifth	graders
sitting	 Indian-style	 on	 the	 floor.	 As	 a	 teacher	 cal ls	 their	 names	 the
students	respond	not	with	the	vacant	“Here”	standard 	in	schools,	but
instead	call	out	a	number	that	indicates	how	they	fe el;	one	means	low
spirits,	ten	high	energy.
Today	spirits	are	high:
“Jessica.”
“Ten:	I’m	jazzed,	it’s	Friday.”
“Patrick.”
“Nine:	excited,	a	little	nervous.”
“Nicole.”
“Ten:	peaceful,	happy	…”
It’s	a	class	in	Self	Science	at	the	Nueva	School,	a 	school	retrofitted
into	 what	 used	 to	 be	 the	 grand	 manse	 of	 the	 Crocker	 f amily,	 the
dynasty	that	founded	one	of	San	Francisco’s	biggest 	banks.	Now	the
building,	 which	 resembles	 a	 miniature	 version	 of	 the	 San	 Francisco
Opera	House,	houses	a	private	school	that	offers	wh at	may	be	a	model
course	in	emotional	intelligence.
The	 subject	 in	 Self	 Science	 is	 feelings—your	 own	 and 	 those	 that
erupt	 in	 relationships.	 The	 topic,	 by	 its	 very	 natu re,	 demands	 that
teachers	and	students	focus	on	the	emotional	fabric	 of	a	child’s	life—a
focus	that	is	determinedly	ignored	in	almost	every	ot her	classroom	in
America.	The	strategy	here	includes	using	the	tensio ns	and	traumas	of
children’s	lives	as	the	topic	of	the	day.	Teachers	 speak	to	real	issues—
hurt	over	being	left	out,	envy,	disagreements	that	could	esca late	into	a
schoolyard	 battle.	 As	 Karen	 Stone	 McCown,	 developer 	 of	 the	 Self
Science	 Curriculum	 and	 founder	 of	 Nueva,	 put	 it,	 “Le arning	 doesn’t
take	place	in	isolation	from	kids’	feelings.	Being	e motionally	literate	is
as	important	for	learning	as	instruction	in	math	and	reading.” 1
======================================== [Página 288] ========================================

Self	 Science	 is	 a	 pioneer,	 an	 early	 harbinger	 of	 an 	 idea	 that	 is
spreading	 to	 schools	 coast	 to	 coast. *	 Names	 for	 these	 classes	 range
from	 “social	 development”	 to	 “life	 skills”	 to	 “social 	 and	 emotional
learning.”	 Some,	 referring	 to	 Howard	 Gardner’s	 idea	 o f	 multiple
intelligences,	 use	 the	 term	 “personal	 intelligences. ”	 The	 common
thread	 is	 the	 goal	 of	 raising	 the	 level	 of	 social	 a nd	 emotional
competence	in	children	as	a	part	of	their	regular	ed ucation—not	just
something	 taught	 remedially	 to	 children	 who	 are	 falte ring	 and
identified	 as	 “troubled,”	 but	 a	 set	 of	 skills	 and	 u nderstandings
essential	for	every	child.
The	 emotional-literacy	 courses	 have	 some	 remote	 roots	 in	 the
affective-education	 movement	 of	 the	 1960s.	 The	 thinki ng	 then	 was
that	psychological	and	motivational	lessons	were	more 	deeply	learned
if	 they	 involved	 an	 immediate	 experience	 of	 what	 was	 being	 taught
conceptually.	 The	 emotional-literacy	 movement,	 though, 	 turns	 the
term	affective	education 	inside	out—instead	of	using	affect	to	educate,
it	educates	affect	itself.
More	 immediately,	 many	 of	 these	 courses	 and	 the	 momentum	 for
their	spread	come	from	an	ongoing	series	of	school-ba sed	prevention
programs,	 each	 targeting	 a	 specific	 problem:	 teen	 smok ing,	 drug
abuse,	 pregnancy,	 dropping	 out,	 and	 most	 recently	 vi olence.	 As	 we
saw	 in	 the	 last	 chapter,	 the	 W.	 T.	 Grant	 Consortium’ s	 study	 of
prevention	 programs	 found	 they	 are	 far	 more	 effective 	 when	 they
teach	 a	 core	 of	 emotional	 and	 social	 competences,	 suc h	 as	 impulse
control,	 managing	 anger,	 and	 finding	 creative	 soluti ons	 to	 social
predicaments.	 From	 this	 principle	 a	 new	 generation	 of 	 interventions
has	emerged.
As	 we	 saw	 in	 Chapter	 15 ,	 interventions	 designed	 to	 target	 the
specific	deficits	in	emotional	and	social	skills	tha t	undergird	problems
such	as	aggression	or	depression	can	be	highly	effe ctive	as	buffers	for
children.	 But	 those	 well-designed	 interventions,	 in 	 the	 main,	 have
been	run	by	research	psychologists	as	experiments.	T he	next	step	is	to
take	 the	 lessons	 learned	 from	 such	 highly	 focused	 pr ograms	 and
generalize	 them	 as	 a	 preventive	 measure	 for	 the	 entir e	 school
population,	taught	by	ordinary	teachers.
This	more	sophisticated	and	more	effective	approach	t o	prevention
includes	 information	 about	 problems	 such	 as	 AIDS,	 dru gs,	 and	 the
like,	at	the	points	in	youngsters’	lives	when	they	 are	beginning	to	face
them.	 But	 its	 main,	 ongoing	 subject	 is	 the	 core	 compet ence	 that	 is
brought	 to	 bear	 on	 any	 of	 these	 specific	 dilemmas:	 emo tional
======================================== [Página 289] ========================================

intelligence.
This	 new	 departure	 in	 bringing	 emotional	 literacy	 in to	 schools
makes	emotions	and	social	life	themselves	topics,	rath er	than	treating
these	most	compelling	facets	of	a	child’s	day	as	irre levant	intrusions
or,	 when	 they	 lead	 to	 eruptions,	 relegating	 them	 to	 occasional
disciplinary	trips	to	the	guidance	counselor	or	the	princip al’s	office.
The	classes	themselves	may	at	first	glance	seem	uneven tful,	much
less	 a	 solution	 to	 the	 dramatic	 problems	 they	 address .	 But	 that	 is
largely	because,	like	good	childrearing	at	home,	the 	lessons	imparted
are	small	but	telling,	delivered	regularly	and	over	 a	sustained	period
of	 years.	 That	 is	 how	 emotional	 learning	 becomes	 ingr ained;	 as
experiences	 are	 repeated	 over	 and	 over,	 the	 brain	 r eflects	 them	 as
strengthened	 pathways,	 neural	 habits	 to	 apply	 in	 ti mes	 of	 duress,
frustration,	 hurt.	 And	 while	 the	 everyday	 substance 	 of	 emotional
literacy	 classes	 may	 look	 mundane,	 the	 outcome—decent	 h uman
beings—is	more	critical	to	our	future	than	ever.
A	LESSON	IN	COOPERATION
Compare	 a	 moment	 from	 a	 class	 in	 Self	 Science	 with	 the	 classroom
experiences	you	can	recall.
A	fifth-grade	group	is	about	to	play	the	Cooperatio n	Squares	game,
in	 which	 the	 students	 team	 up	 to	 put	 together	 a	 seri es	 of	 square-
shaped	 jigsaw	 puzzles.	 The	 catch:	 their	 teamwork	 is	 all	 in	 silence,
with	no	gesturing	allowed.
The	teacher,	Jo-An	Vargo,	divides	the	class	into	th ree	groups,	each
assigned	to	a	different	table.	Three	observers,	eac h	familiar	with	the
game,	get	an	evaluation	sheet	to	assess,	for	example, 	who	in	the	group
takes	the	lead	in	organizing,	who	is	a	clown,	who	disrupts.
The	students	dump	the	pieces	of	the	puzzles	on	the	t able	and	go	to
work.	Within	a	minute	or	so	it’s	clear	that	one	grou p	is	surprisingly
efficient	as	a	team;	they	finish	in	just	a	few	minute s.	A	second	group
of	four	is	engaged	in	solitary,	parallel	efforts,	e ach	working	separately
on	their	own	puzzle,	but	getting	nowhere.	Then	they 	slowly	start	to
work	collectively	to	assemble	their	first	square,	an d	continue	to	work
as	a	unit	until	all	the	puzzles	are	solved.
But	 the	 third	 group	 still	 struggles,	 with	 only	 one	 puzzle	 nearing
completion,	 and	 even	 that	 looking	 more	 like	 a	 trapezo id	 than	 a
square.	 Sean,	 Fairlie,	 and	 Rahman	 have	 yet	 to	 find	 t he	 smooth
======================================== [Página 290] ========================================

coordination	 that	 the	 other	 two	 groups	 fell	 into.	 T hey	 are	 clearly
frustrated,	 frantically	 scanning	 the	 pieces	 on	 the	 table,	 seizing	 on
likely	possibilities	and	putting	them	near	the	partl y	finished	squares,
only	to	be	disappointed	by	the	lack	of	fit.
The	tension	breaks	a	bit	when	Rahman	takes	two	of	th e	pieces	and
puts	 them	 in	 front	 of	 his	 eyes	 like	 a	 mask;	 his	 partn ers	 giggle.	 This
will	prove	to	be	a	pivotal	moment	in	the	day’s	lesson.
Jo-An	 Vargo,	 the	 teacher,	 offers	 some	 encouragement:	 “Those	 of
you	who	have	finished	can	give	one	specific	hint	to 	those	who	are	still
working.”
Dagan	 moseys	 over	 to	 the	 still-struggling	 group,	 poi nts	 to	 two
pieces	that	jut	out	from	the	square,	and	suggests,	“ You’ve	got	to	move
those	two	pieces	around.”	Suddenly	Rahman,	his	wide	 face	furrowed
in	 concentration,	 grasps	 the	 new	 gestalt,	 and	 the	 p ieces	 quickly	 fall
into	 place	 on	 the	 first	 puzzle,	 then	 the	 others.	 Th ere’s	 spontaneous
applause	 as	 the	 last	 piece	 falls	 into	 place	 on	 the	 third	 group’s	 final
puzzle.
A	POINT	OF	CONTENTION
But	as	the	class	goes	on	to	mull	over	the	object	les sons	in	teamwork
they’ve	received,	there	is	another,	more	intense	int erchange.	Rahman,
tall	and	with	a	shock	of	bushy	black	hair	cut	into	 a	longish	crew	cut,
and	Tucker,	the	group’s	observer,	are	locked	in	con tentious	discussion
over	 the	 rule	 that	 you	 can’t	 gesture.	 Tucker,	 his	 b lond	 hair	 neatly
combed	except	for	a	cowlick,	wears	a	baggy	blue	T-sh irt	emblazoned
with	 the	 motto	 “Be	 Responsible,”	 which	 somehow	 unders cores	 his
official	role.
“You	 can	too	 offer	 a	 piece—that’s	 not	 gesturing,”	 Tucker	 says	 to
Rahman	in	an	emphatic,	argumentative	tone.
“But	that	is	gesturing,”	Rahman	insists,	vehement.
Vargo	 notices	 the	 heightened	 volume	 and	 increasingly 	 aggressive
staccato	of	the	exchange,	and	gravitates	to	their	table.	Thi s	is	a	critical
incident,	a	spontaneous	exchange	of	heated	feeling; 	it	is	in	moments
such	 as	 this	 that	 the	 lessons	 already	 learned	 will	 pay	 off,	 and	 new
ones	 can	 be	 taught	 most	 profitably.	 And,	 as	 every	 go od	 teacher
knows,	 the	 lessons	 applied	 in	 such	 electric	 moments	 w ill	 last	 in
students’	memories.
“This	isn’t	a	criticism—you	cooperated	very	well—but	T ucker,	try
======================================== [Página 291] ========================================

to	 say	 what	 you	 mean	 in	 a	 tone	 of	 voice	 that	 doesn’t 	 sound	 so
critical,”	Vargo	coaches.
Tucker,	his	voice	calmer	now,	says	to	Rahman,	“You	ca n	just	put	a
piece	 where	 you	 think	 it	 goes,	 give	 someone	 what	 you 	 think	 they
need,	without	gesturing.	Just	offering.”
Rahman	responds	in	an	angry	tone,	“You	could	have	ju st	gone	like
this”—he	 scratches	 his	 head	 to	 illustrate	 an	 innocen t	 movement
—“and	he’d	say	‘No	gesturing!’	”
There	is	clearly	more	to	Rahman’s	ire	than	this	dispu te	about	what
does	 or	 does	 not	 constitute	 a	 gesture.	 His	 eyes	 cons tantly	 go	 to	 the
evaluation	sheet	Tucker	has	filled	out,	which—though 	it	has	not	yet
been	mentioned—has	actually	provoked	the	tension	betw een	Tucker
and	 Rahman.	 On	 the	 evaluation	 sheet	 Tucker	 has	 liste d	 Rahman’s
name	in	the	blank	for	“Who	is	disruptive?”
Vargo,	 noticing	 Rahman	 looking	 at	 the	 offending	 form, 	 hazards	 a
guess,	saying	to	Tucker,	“He’s	feeling	that	you	used 	a	negative	word
—disruptive —about	him.	What	did	you	mean?”
“I	didn’t	mean	it	was	a	 bad	kind	of	disruption,”	says	Tucker,	now
conciliatory.
Rahman	isn’t	buying	it,	but	his	voice	is	calmer,	too: 	“That’s	a	little
farfetched,	if	you	ask	me.”
Vargo	emphasizes	a	positive	way	of	seeing	it.	“Tucke r	is	trying	to
say	 that	 what	 could	 be	 considered	 disruptive	 could	 also	 be	 part	 of
lightening	things	up	during	a	frustrating	time.”
“But,”	Rahman	protests,	now	more	matter-of-fact,	 “disruptive	is 	like
when	 we’re	 all	 concentrating	 hard	 on	 something	 and	 i f	 I	 went	 like
this”—he	makes	a	ridiculous,	clowning	expression,	his 	eyes	bulging,
cheeks	puffed	out—“that	would	be	disruptive.”
Vargo	tries	more	emotional	coaching,	telling	Tucker,	 “In	trying	to
help,	you	didn’t	mean	he	was	disruptive	in	a	bad	way .	But	you	send	a
different	message	in	how	you’re	talking	about	it.	Ra hman	is	needing
you	to	hear	and	accept	his	feelings.	Rahman	was	sayi ng	that	having
negative	words	like	 disruptive	feels 	unfair.	He	doesn’t	like	being	called
that.”
Then,	 to	 Rahman,	 she	 adds,	 “I	 appreciate	 the	 way	 you ’re	 being
assertive	 in	 talking	 with	 Tucker.	 You’re	 not	 attack ing.	 But	 it’s	 not
pleasant	to	have	a	label	like	 disruptive 	put	on	you.	When	you	put	those
pieces	up	to	your	eyes	it	seems	like	you	were	feelin g	frustrated	and
wanted	to	lighten	things	up.	But	Tucker	called	it	d isruptive	because
he	didn’t	understand	your	intent.	Is	that	right?”
======================================== [Página 292] ========================================

Both	boys	nod	assent	as	the	other	students	finish	c learing	away	the
puzzles.	 This	 small	 classroom	 melodrama	 is	 reaching	 its 	 finale.	 “Do
you	feel	better?”	Vargo	asks.	“Or	is	this	still	distressing? ”
“Yeah,	I	feel	okay,”	says	Rahman,	his	voice	softer	n ow	that	he	feels
heard	and	understood.	Tucker	nods,	too,	smiling.	The 	boys,	noticing
that	everyone	else	has	already	left	for	the	next	cl ass,	turn	in	unison
and	dash	out	together.
POSTMORTEM:	A	FIGHT	THAT	DID	NOT	BREAK	OUT
As	a	new	group	starts	to	find	their	chairs,	Vargo	d issects	what	has	just
transpired.	The	heated	exchange	and	its	cooling-dow n	draw	on	what
the	boys	have	been	learning	about	conflict	resoluti on.	What	typically
escalates	 to	 conflict	 begins,	 as	 Vargo	 puts	 it,	 wit h	 “not
communicating,	 making	 assumptions,	 and	 jumping	 to	 conclu sions,
sending	 a	 ‘hard’	 message	 in	 ways	 that	 make	 it	 tough	 f or	 people	 to
hear	what	you’re	saying.”
Students	in	Self	Science	learn	that	the	point	is	no t	to	avoid	conflict
completely,	 but	 to	 resolve	 disagreement	 and	 resentment 	 before	 it
spirals	 into	 an	 out-and-out	 fight.	 There	 are	 signs	 of	 these	 earlier
lessons	 in	 how	 Tucker	 and	 Rahman	 handled	 the	 dispute .	 Both,	 for
example,	 made	 some	 effort	 to	 express	 their	 point	 of	 vi ew	 in	 a	 way
that	would	not	accelerate	the	conflict.	This	assert iveness	(as	distinct
from	aggression	or	passivity)	is	taught	at	Nueva	fro m	third	grade	on.
It	emphasizes	expressing	feelings	forthrightly,	but	 in	a	way	that	will
not	 spiral	 into	 aggression.	 While	 at	 the	 beginning	 of	 their	 dispute
neither	 boy	 was	 looking	 at	 the	 other,	 as	 it	 went	 on 	 they	 began	 to
show	 signs	 of	 “active	 listening,”	 facing	 each	 other ,	 making	 eye
contact,	and	sending	the	silent	cues	that	let	a	spe aker	know	that	he	is
being	heard.
By	putting	these	tools	into	action,	helped	along	by 	some	coaching,
“assertiveness”	 and	 “active	 listening”	 for	 these	 bo ys	 become	 more
than	just	empty	phrases	on	a	quiz—they	become	ways	of	 reacting	the
boys	 can	 draw	 on	 at	 those	 moments	 when	 they	 need	 them	 most
urgently.
Mastery	 in	 the	 emotional	 domain	 is	 especially	 difficu lt	 because
skills	need	to	be	acquired	when	people	are	usually	least	able 	to	take	in
new	 information	 and	 learn	 new	 habits	 of	 response—when 	 they	 are
upset.	 Coaching	 in	 these	 moments	 helps.	 “Anyone,	 adul t	 or	 fifth
======================================== [Página 293] ========================================

grader,	needs	some	help	being	a	self-observer	when	t hey’re	so	upset,”
Vargo	 points	 out.	 “Your	 heart	 is	 pounding,	 your	 han ds	 are	 sweaty,
you’re	jittery,	and	you’re	trying	to	listen	clearly 	while	keeping	your
own	 self-control	 to	 get	 through	 it	 without	 screaming ,	 blaming,	 or
clamming	up	in	defensiveness.”
For	anyone	familiar	with	the	rough-and-tumble	of	fift h-grade	boys,
what	may	be	most	remarkable	is	that	both	Tucker	and	Ra hman	tried
to	 assert	 their	 views	 without	 resorting	 to	 blaming,	 name-calling,	 or
yelling.	 Neither	 let	 their	 feelings	 escalate	 to	 a	 c ontemptuous	 “f——
you!”	or	a	fistfight,	nor	cut	off	the	other	by	stal king	out	of	the	room.
What	 could	 have	 been	 the	 seed	 of	 a	 full-fledged	 bat tle	 instead
heightened	 the	 boys’	 mastery	 of	 the	 nuances	 of	 confl ict	 resolution.
How	 differently	 it	 all	 could	 have	 gone	 in	 other	 circ umstances.
Youngsters	daily	come	to	blows—and	even	worse—over	less.
CONCERNS	OF	THE	DAY
At	 the	 traditional	 circle	 that	 opens	 each	 class	 in	 Self	 Science,	 the
numbers	are	not	always	so	high	as	they	were	today.	W hen	they	are
low—the	ones,	twos,	or	threes	that	indicate	feeling	 terrible—it	opens
the	way	for	someone	to	ask,	“Do	you	want	to	talk	abo ut	why	you	feel
that	 way?”	 And,	 if	 the	 student	 wants	 (no	 one	 is	 pre ssured	 to	 talk
about	things	they	don’t	want	to),	it	allows	the	air ing	of	whatever	is	so
troubling—and	the	chance	to	consider	creative	options	for	ha ndling	it.
The	 troubles	 that	 emerge	 vary	 with	 the	 grade	 level.	 In	 the	 lower
grades	 typical	 ones	 are	 teasing,	 feeling	 left	 out,	 fears.	 Around	 sixth
grade	a	new	set	of	concerns	emerges—hurt	feelings	abo ut	not	being
asked	 on	 a	 date,	 or	 being	 left	 out;	 friends	 who	 are 	 immature;	 the
painful	predicaments	of	the	young	(“Big	kids	are	pic king	on	me”;	“My
friends	are	smoking,	and	they’re	always	trying	to	get	me	to	try, 	too”).
These	are	the	topics	of	gripping	import	in	a	child’s 	life,	which	are
aired	on	the	periphery	of	school—at	lunch,	on	the	bu s	to	school,	at	a
friend’s	house—if	at	all.	More	often	than	not,	these 	are	the	troubles
that	children	keep	to	themselves,	obsessing	about	th em	alone	at	night,
having	 no	 one	 to	 mull	 them	 over	 with.	 In	 Self	 Science 	 they	 can
become	topics	of	the	day.
Each	 of	 these	 discussions	 is	 potential	 grist	 for	 th e	 explicit	 goal	 of
Self	 Science,	 which	 is	 illuminating	 the	 child’s	 sens e	 of	 self	 and
relationships	 with	 others.	 While	 the	 course	 has	 a	 l esson	 plan,	 it	 is
======================================== [Página 294] ========================================

flexible	so	that	when	moments	such	as	the	conflict	be tween	Rahman
and	Tucker	occur	they	can	be	capitalized	on.	The	is sues	that	students
bring	up	provide	the	living	examples	to	which	studen ts	and	teachers
alike	 can	 apply	 the	 skills	 they	 are	 learning,	 such	 as	 the	 conflict-
resolution	methods	that	cooled	down	the	heat	between	the	two	b oys.
THE	ABC’S	OF	EMOTIONAL	INTELLIGENCE
In	use	for	close	to	twenty	years,	the	Self	Science	 curriculum	stands	as
a	 model	 for	 the	 teaching	 of	 emotional	 intelligence.	 T he	 lessons
sometimes	 are	 surprisingly	 sophisticated;	 as	 Nueva’s	 director,	 Karen
Stone	McCown,	told	me,	“When	we	teach	about	anger,	w e	help	kids
understand	that	it	is	almost	always	a	secondary	reac tion	and	to	look
for	what’s	underneath—are	you	hurt?	jealous?	Our	kid s	learn	that	you
always	have	choices	about	how	you	respond	to	emotion ,	and	the	more
ways	you	know	to	respond	to	an	emotion,	the	richer	your	life	can 	be.”
A	 list	 of	 the	 contents	 of	 Self	 Science	 is	 an	 almost	 point-for-point
match	 with	 the	 ingredients	 of	 emotional	 intelligence—a nd	 with	 the
core	 skills	 recommended	 as	 primary	 prevention	 for	 the	 range	 of
pitfalls	 threatening	 children	 (see	 Appendix	 E 	 for	 the	 full	 list). 2	 The
topics	 taught	 include	 self-awareness,	 in	 the	 sense	 of	 recognizing
feelings	 and	 building	 a	 vocabulary	 for	 them,	 and	 see ing	 the	 links
between	 thoughts,	 feelings,	 and	 reactions;	 knowing	 if	 thoughts	 or
feelings	are	ruling	a	decision;	seeing	the	conseque nces	of	alternative
choices;	and	applying	these	insights	to	decisions	a bout	such	issues	as
drugs,	 smoking,	 and	 sex.	 Self-awareness	 also	 takes	 t he	 form	 of
recognizing	your	strengths	and	weaknesses,	and	seei ng	yourself	in	a
positive	 but	 realistic	 light	 (and	 so	 avoiding	 a	 commo n	 pitfall	 of	 the
self-esteem	movement).
Another	emphasis	is	managing	emotions:	realizing	what	 is	behind	a
feeling	(for	example,	the	hurt	that	triggers	anger), 	and	learning	ways
to	handle	anxieties,	anger,	and	sadness.	Still	anot her	emphasis	is	on
taking	responsibility	for	decisions	and	actions,	an d	following	through
on	commitments.
A	key	social	ability	is	empathy,	understanding	other s’	feelings	and
taking	their	perspective,	and	respecting	difference s	in	how	people	feel

assertive	 rather	 than	 angry	 or	 passive;	 and	 learnin g	 the	 arts	 of

There	 are	 no	 grades	 given	 in	 Self	 Science;	 life	 its elf	 is	 the	 final
exam.	 But	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 eighth	 grade,	 as	 student s	 are	 about	 to
leave	Nueva	for	high	school,	each	is	given	a	Socrat ic	examination,	an
oral	test	in	Self	Science.	One	question	from	a	recen t	final:	“Describe
an	appropriate	response	to	help	a	friend	solve	a	co nflict	over	someone
pressuring	them	to	try	drugs,	or	over	a	friend	who	l ikes	to	tease.”	Or,
“What	are	some	healthy	ways	to	deal	with	stress,	anger,	and	fea r?”

EMOTIONAL	LITERACY	IN	THE	INNER	CITY
Skeptics	 understandably	 will	 ask	 if	 a	 course	 like	 S elf	 Science	 could
work	 in	 a	 less	 privileged	 setting,	 or	 if	 it	 is	 only 	 possible	 in	 a	 small
private	 school	 like	 Nueva,	 where	 every	 child	 is,	 in 	 some	 respect,
gifted.	In	short,	can	emotional	competence	be	taught	 where	it	may	be
most	 urgently	 needed,	 in	 the	 gritty	 chaos	 of	 an	 inne r-city	 public
school?	One	answer	is	to	visit	the	Augusta	Lewis	Tr oup	Middle	School
in	 New	 Haven,	 which	 is	 as	 far	 from	 the	 Nueva	 School	 s ocially	 and
economically	as	it	is	geographically.
To	 be	 sure,	 the	 atmosphere	 at	 Troup	 has	 much	 of	 the	 s ame
excitement	 about	 learning—the	 school	 is	 also	 known	 as 	 the	 Troup
Magnet	 Academy	 of	 Science	 and	 is	 one	 of	 two	 such	 sch ools	 in	 the
district	that	are	designed	to	draw	fifth-	to	eighth -grade	students	from
all	over	New	Haven	to	an	enriched	science	curriculum. 	Students	there
can	ask	questions	about	the	physics	of	outer	space	 through	a	satellite-
dish	hookup	to	astronauts	in	Houston	or	program	their 	computers	to
play	music.	But	despite	these	academic	amenities,	as	i n	many	cities,
white	flight	to	the	New	Haven	suburbs	and	to	private 	schools	has	left
Troup’s	enrollment	about	95	percent	black	and	Hispanic.
Just	a	few	short	blocks	from	the	Yale	campus—and	again 	a	distant
universe—Troup	is	in	a	decaying	working-class	neighb orhood	that,	in
the	1950s,	had	twenty	thousand	people	employed	in	ne arby	factories,
from	 Olin	 Brass	 Mills	 to	 Winchester	 Arms.	 Today	 that	 job	 base	 has
shrunk	 to	 under	 three	 thousand,	 shrinking	 with	 it	 t he	 economic
horizons	 of	 the	 families	 who	 live	 there.	 New	 Haven,	 l ike	 so	 many
other	 New	 England	 manufacturing	 cities,	 has	 sunk	 int o	 a	 pit	 of
======================================== [Página 296] ========================================

poverty,	drugs,	and	violence.
It	was	in	response	to	the	urgencies	of	this	urban	n ightmare	that	in
the	1980s	a	group	of	Yale	psychologists	and	educato rs	designed	the
Social	Competence	Program,	a	set	of	courses	that	cove rs	virtually	the
same	 terrain	 as	 the	 Nueva	 School’s	 Self	 Science	 curr iculum.	 But	 at
Troup	the	connection	to	the	topics	is	often	more	dir ect	and	raw.	It	is
no	 mere	 academic	 exercise	 when,	 in	 the	 eighth-grade	 s ex	 education
class,	 students	 learn	 how	 personal	 decision-making	 c an	 help	 them
avoid	diseases	such	as	AIDS.	New	Haven	has	the	highe st	proportion	of
women	with	AIDS	in	the	United	States;	a	number	of	the 	mothers	who
send	their	children	to	Troup	have	the	disease—and	so 	do	some	of	the
students	 there.	 Despite	 the	 enriched	 curriculum,	 stu dents	 at	 Troup
struggle	with	all	the	problems	of	the	inner	city;	man y	children	have
home	situations	so	chaotic,	if	not	horrific,	they	ju st	cannot	manage	to
get	to	school	some	days.
As	in	all	New	Haven	schools,	the	most	prominent	sign	t hat	greets	a
visitor	is	in	the	familiar	form	of	a	yellow	diamond-sh aped	traffic	sign,
but	 reads	 “Drug-Free	 Zone.”	 At	 the	 door	 is	 Mary	 Elle n	 Collins,	 the
school’s	 facilitator—an	 all-purpose	 ombudsman	 who	 sees 	 to	 special
problems	 as	 they	 surface,	 and	 whose	 role	 includes	 he lping	 teachers
with	the	demands	of	the	social	competence	curriculum.	 If	a	teacher	is
unsure	of	how	to	teach	a	lesson,	Collins	will	come	t o	the	class	to	show
how.
“I	taught	in	this	school	for	twenty	years,”	Collins 	says,	greeting	me.
“Look	at	this	neighborhood—I	can’t	see	only	teaching 	academic	skills
anymore,	 with	 the	 problems	 these	 kids	 face	 just	 in	 li ving.	 Take	 the
kids	here	who	are	struggling	because	they	have	AIDS 	themselves	or
it’s	in	their	homes—I’m	not	sure	they’d	say	it	during	 the	discussion	on
AIDS,	 but	 once	 a	 kid	 knows	 a	 teacher	 will	 listen	 to 	 an	 emotional
problem,	 not	 just	 academic	 ones,	 the	 avenue	 is	 open	 t o	 have	 that
conversation.”
On	the	third	floor	of	the	old	brick	school	Joyce	An drews	is	leading
her	 fifth	 graders	 through	 the	 social	 competence	 clas s	 they	 get	 three
times	a	week.	Andrews,	like	all	the	other	fifth-grad e	teachers,	went	to
a	 special	 summer	 course	 in	 how	 to	 teach	 it,	 but	 her	 e xuberance
suggests	the	topics	in	social	competence	come	naturally	to	her .
Today’s	 lesson	 is	 on	 identifying	 feelings;	 being	 ab le	 to	 name
feelings,	and	so	better	distinguish	between	them,	is 	a	key	emotional
skill.	 Last	 night’s	 assignment	 was	 to	 bring	 in	 pictu res	 of	 a	 person’s
face	 from	 a	 magazine,	 name	 which	 emotion	 the	 face	 displ ays,	 and
======================================== [Página 297] ========================================

explain	how	to	tell	the	person	has	those	feelings.	 After	collecting	the
assignment,	Andrews	lists	the	feelings	on	the	board—s adness,	worry,
excitement,	 happiness,	 and	 so	 on—and	 launches	 into	 a	 fast-paced
repartee	with	the	eighteen	students	who	managed	to	get	to	scho ol	that
day.	 Sitting	 in	 four-desk	 clusters,	 the	 students	 ex citedly	 raise	 their
hands	high,	straining	to	catch	her	eye	so	they	can	give	their	a nswer.
As	she	adds	frustrated 	to	the	list	on	the	board,	Andrews	asks,	“How
many	people	ever	felt	frustrated?”	Every	hand	goes	up.
“How	do	you	feel	when	you’re	frustrated?”
The	 answers	 come	 in	 a	 cascade:	 “Tired.”	 “Confused.”	 “You	 can’t
think	right.”	“Anxious.”
As	aggravated 	 is	 added	 to	 the	 list,	 Joyce	 says,	 “I	 know	 that	 one —
when	does	a	teacher	feel	aggravated?”
“When	everyone	is	talking,”	a	girl	offers,	smiling.
Without	 missing	 a	 beat,	 Andrews	 passes	 out	 a	 mimeograp hed
worksheet.	In	one	column	are	faces	of	boys	and	girls ,	each	displaying
one	 of	 the	 six	 basic	 emotions—happy,	 sad,	 angry,	 surp rised,	 afraid,
disgusted—and	a	description	of	the	facial	muscle	acti vity	underlying
each,	for	example:
AFRAID:
•	The	mouth	is	open	and	drawn	back.
•	The	eyes	are	open	and	the	inner	corners	go	up.
•	The	eyebrows	are	raised	and	drawn	together.
•	There	are	wrinkles	in	the	middle	of	the	forehead. 3
While	 they	 read	 through	 the	 sheet,	 expressions	 of	 f ear,	 anger,
surprise,	or	disgust	float	over	the	faces	of	the	ki ds	in	Andrews’s	class
as	 they	 imitate	 the	 pictures	 and	 follow	 the	 facial-mu scle	 recipes	 for
each	emotion.	This	lesson	comes	straight	from	Paul	Ekma n’s	research
on	 facial	 expression;	 as	 such,	 it	 is	 taught	 in	 most	 every	 college
introductory	psychology	course—and	rarely,	if	ever,	 in	grade	school.
This	elementary	lesson	in	connecting	a	name	with	a	fe eling,	and	the
feeling	 with	 the	 facial	 expression	 that	 matches	 it,	 might	 seem	 so
obvious	 that	 it	 need	 not	 be	 taught	 at	 all.	 Yet	 it	 ma y	 serve	 as	 an
antidote	 to	 surprisingly	 common	 lapses	 in	 emotional	 li teracy.
Schoolyard	bullies,	remember,	often	strike	out	in	ang er	because	they

who	 develop	 eating	 disorders	 fail	 to	 distinguish	 an ger	 from	 anxiety
from	hunger.
EMOTIONAL	LITERACY	IN	DISGUISE
With	the	curriculum	already	besieged	by	a	proliferat ion	of	new	topics
and	 agendas,	 some	 teachers	 who	 understandably	 feel	 o verburdened
resist	taking	extra	time	from	the	basics	for	yet	anot her	course.	So	an
emerging	strategy	in	emotional	education	is	not	to	cr eate	a	new	class,
but	 to	 blend	 lessons	 on	 feelings	 and	 relationships	 with	 other	 topics
already	 taught.	 Emotional	 lessons	 can	 merge	 naturally 	 into	 reading
and	writing,	health,	science,	social	studies,	and	o ther	standard	courses
as	well.	While	in	the	New	Haven	schools	Life	Skills	 is	a	separate	topic
in	 some	 grades,	 in	 other	 years	 the	 social	 development 	 curriculum
blends	into	courses	such	as	reading	or	health.	Some	 of	the	lessons	are
even	taught	as	part	of	math	class—notably	basic	study 	skills	such	as
how	to	put	aside	distractions,	motivate	yourself	to	 study,	and	manage
your	impulses	so	you	can	attend	to	learning.
Some	programs	in	emotional	and	social	skills	take	no	c urriculum	or
class	 time	 as	 a	 separate	 subject	 at	 all,	 but	 instead 	 infiltrate	 their
lessons	into	the	very	fabric	of	school	life.	One	mod el	for	this	approach
—essentially,	an	invisible	emotional	and	social	compet ence	course—is
the	 Child	 Development	 Project,	 created	 by	 a	 team	 dire cted	 by
psychologist	Eric	Schaps.	The	project,	based	in	Oak land,	California,	is
currently	being	tried	in	a	handful	of	schools	acros s	the	nation,	most	in
neighborhoods	 that	 share	 many	 of	 the	 troubles	 of	 New 	 Haven’s
decaying	core. 4
The	 project	 offers	 a	 prepackaged	 set	 of	 materials	 th at	 fit	 into
existing	courses.	Thus	first	graders	in	their	readi ng	class	get	a	story,
“Frog	and	Toad	Are	Friends,”	in	which	Frog,	eager	t o	play	with	his
hibernating	friend	Toad,	plays	a	trick	on	him	to	get 	him	up	early.	The
story	is	used	as	a	platform	for	a	class	discussion	a bout	friendship,	and
issues	such	as	how	people	feel	when	someone	plays	a	 trick	on	them.	A
succession	of	adventures	brings	up	topics	such	as	s elf-consciousness,
being	 aware	 of	 a	 friend’s	 needs,	 what	 it	 feels	 like 	 to	 be	 teased,	 and
sharing	feelings	with	friends.	A	set	curriculum	plan 	offers	increasingly
sophisticated	 stories	 as	 children	 go	 through	 the	 el ementary	 and
middle-school	 grades,	 giving	 teachers	 entry	 points	 t o	 discuss	 topics
such	as	empathy,	perspective-taking,	and	caring.
======================================== [Página 299] ========================================

Another	way	emotional	lessons	are	woven	into	the	fab ric	of	existing
school	 life	 is	 through	 helping	 teachers	 rethink	 how 	 to	 discipline
students	 who	 misbehave.	 The	 assumption	 in	 the	 Child	 D evelopment
program	is	that	such	moments	are	ripe	opportunities	to 	teach	children
skills	 that	 are	 lacking—impulse	 control,	 explaining	 t heir	 feelings,
resolving	conflicts—and	that	there	are	better	ways	t o	discipline	than
coercion.	A	teacher	seeing	three	first	graders	push ing	to	be	the	first	in
the	lunchroom	line	might	suggest	that	they	each	guess 	a	number,	and
let	 the	 winner	 go	 first.	 The	 immediate	 lesson	 is	 that 	 there	 are
impartial,	fair	ways	to	settle	such	pint-size	disput es,	while	the	deeper
teaching	 is	 that	 disputes	 can	 be	 negotiated.	 And	 si nce	 that	 is	 an
approach	 those	 children	 can	 take	 with	 them	 to	 settle 	 other	 similar
disputes	 (“Me	 first!”	 is,	 after	 all,	 epidemic	 in	 low er	 grades—if	 not
through	much	of	life,	in	one	form	or	another)	it	has	 a	more	positive
message	than	the	ubiquitous,	authoritarian	“Stop	that!”
THE	EMOTIONAL	TIMETABLE
“My	friends	Alice	and	Lynn	won’t	play	with	me.”
That	 poignant	 grievance	 is	 from	 a	 third-grade	 girl	 a t	 John	 Muir
Elementary	 School	 in	 Seattle.	 The	 anonymous	 sender	 pu t	 it	 in	 the
“mailbox”	 in	 her	 classroom—actually	 a	 specially	 painte d	 cardboard
box—where	she	and	her	classmates	are	encouraged	to	wr ite	in	their
complaints	and	problems	so	the	whole	class	can	talk	a bout	them	and
try	 to	 think	 of	 ways	 to	 deal	 with	 them.	 The	 discussi on	 will	 not
mention	the	names	of	those	involved;	instead	the	teac her	points	out
that	all	children	share	such	problems	from	time	to	time ,	and	they	all
need	to	learn	how	to	handle	them.	As	they	talk	about 	how	it	feels	to
be	 left	 out,	 or	 what	 they	 might	 do	 to	 be	 included,	 t hey	 have	 the
chance	to	try	out	new	solutions	to	these	quandaries —a	corrective	for
the	one-track	thinking	that	sees	conflict	as	the	on ly	route	to	solving
disagreements.
The	mailbox	allows	flexibility	as	to	exactly	which	c rises	and	issues
will	become	the	subject	of	the	class,	for	a	too-rigi d	agenda	can	be	out
of	step	with	the	fluid	realities	of	childhood.	As	c hildren	change	and
grow	the	preoccupation	of	the	hour	changes	accordin gly.	To	be	most
effective,	emotional	lessons	must	be	pegged	to	the	de velopment	of	the
child,	and	repeated	at	different	ages	in	ways	that	 fit	a	child’s	changing
understanding	and	challenges.
======================================== [Página 300] ========================================

One	question	is	how	early	to	begin.	Some	say	the	fir st	few	years	of
life	 are	 none	 too	 soon.	 The	 Harvard	 pediatrician	 T.	 Berry	 Brazelton
proposes	 that	 many	 parents	 can	 benefit	 from	 being	 coa ched	 as
emotional	 mentors	 to	 their	 infants	 and	 toddlers,	 as	 s ome	 home-visit
programs	do.	A	strong	argument	can	be	made	for	emphasiz ing	social
and	emotional	skills	more	systematically	in	preschool	 programs	such
as	Head	Start;	as	we	saw	in	 Chapter	12 ,	children’s	readiness	to	learn
depends	to	a	large	extent	on	acquiring	some	of	these 	basic	emotional
skills.	 The	 preschool	 years	 are	 crucial	 ones	 for	 la ying	 foundation
skills,	and	there	is	some	evidence	that	Head	Start,	w hen	run	well	(an
important	caveat),	can	have	beneficial	long-term	emoti onal	and	social
effects	on	the	lives	of	its	graduates	even	into	the ir	early	adult	years—
fewer	 drug	 problems	 and	 arrests,	 better	 marriages,	 gr eater	 earning
power. 5
Such	 interventions	 work	 best	 when	 they	 track	 the	 emo tional
timetable	of	development. 6	 As	 the	 wail	 of	 newborns	 testifies,	 babies
have	 intense	 feelings	 from	 the	 moment	 they	 are	 born.	 B ut	 the
newborn’s	 brain	 is	 far	 from	 fully	 mature;	 as	 we	 saw	 i n	Chapter	 15 ,
only	as	its	nervous	system	reaches	final	development—a 	process	that
unfolds	according	to	an	innate	biological	clock	ove r	the	entire	course
of	 childhood	 and	 into	 early	 adolescence—will	 the	 chi ld’s	 emotions
ripen	 completely.	 The	 newborn’s	 repertoire	 of	 feelin g	 is	 primitive
compared	to	the	emotional	range	of	a	five-year-old,	w hich,	in	turn,	is
lacking	when	measured	against	the	fullness	of	feelin gs	of	a	teenager.
Indeed,	adults	all	too	readily	fall	into	the	trap	o f	expecting	children	to
have	reached	a	maturity	far	beyond	their	years,	forg etting	that	each
emotion	 has	 its	 preprogrammed	 moment	 of	 appearance	 in	 a	 child’s
growth.	 A	 four-year-old’s	 braggadocio,	 for	 example,	 might	 bring	 a
parent’s	 reprimand—and	 yet	 the	 self-consciousness	 tha t	 can	 breed
humility	typically	does	not	emerge	until	age	five	or	so.
The	timetable	for	emotional	growth	is	intertwined	wit h	allied	lines
of	development,	particularly	for	cognition,	on	the	o ne	hand,	and	brain
and	biological	maturation,	on	the	other.	As	we	have	 seen,	emotional
capacities	such	as	empathy	and	emotional	self-regulation	sta rt	to	build
virtually	from	infancy.	The	kindergarten	year	marks	a 	peak	ripening
of	 the	 “social	 emotions”—feelings	 such	 as	 insecurity	 and	 humility,
jealousy	 and	 envy,	 pride	 and	 confidence—all	 of	 which 	 require	 the
capacity	 for	 comparing	 oneself	 with	 others.	 The	 five -year-old,	 on
entering	 the	 wider	 social	 world	 of	 school,	 enters	 t oo	 the	 world	 of
social	 comparison.	 It	 is	 not	 just	 the	 external	 shift 	 that	 elicits	 these
======================================== [Página 301] ========================================

comparisons,	but	also	the	emergence	of	a	cognitive	sk ill:	being	able	to
compare	oneself	to	others	on	particular	qualities,	w hether	popularity,
attractiveness,	 or	 skateboarding	 talents.	 This	 is	 t he	 age	 when,	 for
example,	 having	 an	 older	 sister	 who	 gets	 straight	 A’ s	 can	 make	 the
younger	sister	start	to	think	of	herself	as	“dumb”	by	compariso n.
Dr.	 David	 Hamburg,	 a	 psychiatrist	 and	 president	 of	 th e	 Carnegie
Corporation,	 which	 has	 evaluated	 some	 pioneering	 emot ional-
education	programs,	sees	the	years	of	transition	int o	grade	school	and
then	again	into	junior	high	or	middle	school	as	marki ng	two	crucial
points	 in	 a	 child’s	 adjustment. 7	 From	 ages	 six	 to	 eleven,	 says
Hamburg,	 “school	 is	 a	 crucible	 and	 a	 defining	 experie nce	 that	 will
heavily	influence	children’s	adolescence	and	beyond .	A	child’s	sense
of	self-worth	depends	substantially	on	his	or	her	a bility	to	achieve	in
school.	 A	 child	 who	 fails	 in	 school	 sets	 in	 motion	 t he	 self-defeating
attitudes	 that	 can	 dim	 prospects	 for	 an	 entire	 lifes pan.”	 Among	 the
essentials	for	profiting	from	school,	Hamburg	notes,	a re	an	ability	“to
postpone	gratification,	to	be	socially	responsible	 in	appropriate	ways,
to	 maintain	 control	 over	 their	 emotions,	 and	 to	 have	 an	 optimistic
outlook”—in	other	words,	emotional	intelligence. 8
Puberty—because	it	is	a	time	of	extraordinary	change	 in	the	child’s
biology,	thinking	capacities,	and	brain	functioning —is	also	a	crucial
time	for	emotional	and	social	lessons.	As	for	the	tee n	years,	Hamburg
observes	that	“most	adolescents	are	ten	to	fifteen	y ears	old	when	they
are	 exposed	 to	 sexuality,	 alcohol	 and	 drugs,	 smoking ,”	 and	 other
temptations. 9
The	 transition	 to	 middle	 school	 or	 junior	 high	 marks	 an	 end	 to
childhood,	 and	 is	 itself	 a	 formidable	 emotional	 chall enge.	 All	 other
problems	 aside,	 as	 they	 enter	 this	 new	 school	 arrang ement	 virtually
all	 students	 have	 a	 dip	 in	 self-confidence	 and	 a	 ju mp	 in	 self-
consciousness;	 their	 very	 notions	 of	 themselves	 are	 rocky	 and	 in
tumult.	One	of	the	greatest	specific	blows	is	in	“so cial	self-esteem”—
students’	confidence	that	they	can	make	and	keep	fri ends.	It	is	at	this
juncture,	 Hamburg	 points	 out,	 that	 it	 helps	 immensely	 t o	 buttress
boys’	 and	 girls’	 abilities	 to	 build	 close	 relations hips	 and	 navigate
crises	in	friendships,	and	to	nurture	their	self-confidenc e.
Hamburg	notes	that	as	students	are	entering	middle	sch ool,	just	on
the	cusp	of	adolescence,	there	is	something	differen t	about	those	who
have	 had	 emotional	 literacy	 classes:	 they	 find	 the	 n ew	 pressures	 of
peer	politics,	the	upping	of	academic	demands,	and	th e	temptations	to
smoke	 and	 use	 drugs	 less	 troubling	 than	 do	 their	 pee rs.	 They	 have
======================================== [Página 302] ========================================

mastered	emotional	abilities	that,	at	least	for	the	s hort	term,	inoculate
them	against	the	turmoil	and	pressures	they	are	about	to	face.
TIMING	IS	ALL
As	 developmental	 psychologists	 and	 others	 map	 the	 gro wth	 of
emotions,	 they	 are	 able	 to	 be	 more	 specific	 about	 jus t	 what	 lessons
children	 should	 be	 learning	 at	 each	 point	 in	 the	 un folding	 of
emotional	 intelligence,	 what	 the	 lasting	 deficits	 ar e	 likely	 to	 be	 for
those	who	fail	to	master	the	right	competences	at	the 	appointed	time,
and	what	remedial	experiences	might	make	up	for	what	was	missed.
In	the	New	Haven	program,	for	example,	children	in	the 	youngest
grades	get	basic	lessons	in	self-awareness,	relatio nships,	and	decision-
making.	 In	 first	 grade	 students	 sit	 in	 a	 circle	 and	 roll	 the	 “feelings
cube,”	which	has	words	such	as	 sad	or	excited 	on	each	side.	At	their
turn,	they	describe	a	time	they	had	that	feeling,	an 	exercise	that	gives
them	 more	 certainty	 in	 tying	 feelings	 to	 words	 and	 he lps	 with
empathy	as	they	hear	others	having	the	same	feelings	as	themselv es.
By	fourth	and	fifth	grade,	as	peer	relationships	ta ke	on	an	immense
importance	in	their	lives,	they	get	lessons	that	hel p	their	friendships
work	better:	empathy,	impulse	control,	and	anger	manag ement.	The
Life	Skills	class	on	reading	emotions	from	facial	exp ressions	that	the
Troup	 school	 fifth	 graders	 were	 trying,	 for	 example, 	 is	 essentially
about	empathizing.	For	impulse	control,	there	is	a	“s toplight”	poster
displayed	prominently,	with	six	steps:
Red	light 1.	Stop,	calm	down,	and	think	before	you	act.
Yellow	light						 2.	Say	the	problem	and	how	you	feel.
	 3.	Set	a	positive	goal.
	 4.	Think	of	lots	of	solutions.
	 5.	Think	ahead	to	the	consequences.
Green	Light6.	Go	ahead	and	try	the	best	plan.
The	stoplight	notion	is	regularly	invoked	when	a	ch ild,	for	example,
is	about	to	strike	out	in	anger,	or	withdraw	into	a 	huff	at	some	slight,
or	burst	into	tears	at	being	teased,	and	offers	a	c oncrete	set	of	steps
======================================== [Página 303] ========================================

for	 dealing	 with	 these	 loaded	 moments	 in	 a	 more	 measure d	 way.
Beyond	the	management	of	feelings,	it	points	a	way	to 	more	effective
action.	 And,	 as	 a	 habitual	 way	 of	 handling	 the	 unru ly	 emotional
impulse—to	 think	 before	 acting	 from	 feelings—it	 can	 evo lve	 into	 a
basic	strategy	for	dealing	with	the	risks	of	adolescence	and 	beyond.
In	 sixth	 grade	 the	 lessons	 relate	 more	 directly	 to	 t he	 temptations
and	pressures	for	sex,	drugs,	or	drinking	that	begi n	to	enter	children’s
lives.	 By	 ninth	 grade,	 as	 teenagers	 are	 confronted	 with	 more
ambiguous	social	realities,	the	ability	to	take	multi ple	perspectives—
your	own	as	well	as	those	of	others	involved—is	empha sized.	“If	a	kid
is	mad	because	he	saw	his	girlfriend	talking	with	an other	guy,”	says
one	of	the	New	Haven	teachers,	“he’d	be	encouraged	t o	consider	what
might	 be	 going	 on	 from	 their	 point	 of	 view,	 too,	 rath er	 than	 just
plunge	into	a	confrontation.”
EMOTIONAL	LITERACY	AS	PREVENTION
Some	 of	 the	 most	 effective	 programs	 in	 emotional	 litera cy	 were
developed	as	a	response	to	a	specific	problem,	notab ly	violence.	One
of	the	fastest-growing	of	these	prevention-inspired 	emotional	literacy
courses	 is	 the	 Resolving	 Conflict	 Creatively	 Progra m,	 in	 several
hundred	New	York	City	public	schools	and	schools	ac ross	the	country.
The	 conflict-resolution	 course	 focuses	 on	 how	 to	 se ttle	 schoolyard
arguments	that	can	escalate	into	incidents	like	the	hallway	s hooting	of
Ian	 Moore	 and	 Tyrone	 Sinkler	 by	 their	 classmate	 at	 J efferson	 High
School.
Linda	 Lantieri,	 the	 founder	 of	 the	 Resolving	 Confli ct	 Creatively
Program	and	director	of	the	Manhattan-based	national 	center	for	the
approach,	 sees	 it	 as	 having	 a	 mission	 far	 beyond	 jus t	 preventing
fights.	 She	 says,	 “The	 program	 shows	 students	 that	 t hey	 have	 many
choices	 for	 dealing	 with	 conflict	 besides	 passivity 	 or	 aggression.	 We
show	 them	 the	 futility	 of	 violence	 while	 replacing	 i t	 with	 concrete
skills.	 Kids	 learn	 to	 stand	 up	 for	 their	 rights	 wit hout	 resorting	 to
violence.	 These	 are	 lifelong	 skills,	 not	 just	 for	 t hose	 most	 prone	 to
violence.” 10
In	one	exercise,	students	think	of	a	single	realist ic	step,	no	matter
how	small,	that	might	have	helped	settle	some	conflict 	they	have	had.
In	another	students	enact	a	scene	in	which	a	big	si ster	trying	to	do	her
homework	 gets	 fed	 up	 with	 her	 younger	 sister’s	 loud	 rap	 tape.	 In
======================================== [Página 304] ========================================

frustration	the	older	sister	turns	off	the	tape	des pite	the	younger	one’s
protests.	The	class	brainstorms	ways	they	might	work	 out	the	problem
that	would	satisfy	both	sisters.
One	 key	 to	 the	 success	 of	 the	 conflict-resolution	 p rogram	 is
extending	 it	 beyond	 the	 classroom	 to	 the	 playground	 and	 cafeteria,
where	tempers	are	more	likely	to	explode.	To	that	end ,	some	students
are	trained	as	mediators,	a	role	that	can	begin	in	t he	latter	years	of
elementary	 school.	 When	 tension	 erupts,	 students	 can 	 seek	 out	 a
mediator	 to	 help	 them	 settle	 it.	 The	 schoolyard	 mediat ors	 learn	 to
handle	fights,	taunts	and	threats,	interracial	inci dents,	and	the	other
potentially	incendiary	incidents	of	school	life.
The	mediators	learn	to	phrase	their	statements	in	way s	that	make
both	parties	feel	the	mediator	is	impartial.	Their	ta ctics	include	sitting
down	 with	 those	 involved	 and	 getting	 them	 to	 listen	 to	 the	 other
person	 without	 interruptions	 or	 insults.	 They	 have	 each	 party	 calm
down	and	state	their	position,	then	have	each	parap hrase	what’s	been
said	 so	 it’s	 clear	 they’ve	 really	 heard.	 Then	 they	 all	 try	 to	 think	 of
solutions	that	both	sides	can	live	with;	the	settle ments	are	often	in	the
form	of	a	signed	agreement.
Beyond	 the	 mediation	 of	 a	 given	 dispute,	 the	 program	 teaches
students	to	think	differently	about	disagreements	in 	the	first	place.	As
Angel	Perez,	trained	as	a	mediator	while	in	grade	sc hool,	put	it,	the
program	 “changed	 my	 way	 of	 thinking.	 I	 used	 to	 think, 	 hey,	 if
somebody	picks	on	me,	if	somebody	does	something	to	me,	 the	only
thing	was	to	fight,	do	something	to	get	back	at	them. 	Since	I	had	this
program,	 I’ve	 had	 a	 more	 positive	 way	 of	 thinking.	 If 	 something’s
done	negative	to	me,	I	don’t	try	to	do	the	negative	 thing	back—I	try
to	 solve	 the	 problem.”	 And	 he	 has	 found	 himself	 sprea ding	 the
approach	in	his	community.
While	 the	 focus	 of	 Resolving	 Conflict	 Creatively	 is 	 on	 preventing
violence,	Lantieri	sees	it	as	having	a	wider	mission .	Her	view	is	that
the	skills	needed	to	head	 off	 violence	 cannot	 be	 se parated	 from	 the
full	 spectrum	 of	 emotional	 competence—that,	 for	 example, 	 knowing
what	you	are	feeling	or	how	to	handle	impulse	or	gri ef	is	as	important
for	 violence	 prevention	 as	 is	 managing	 anger.	 Much	 o f	 the	 training
has	 to	 do	 with	 emotional	 basics	 such	 as	 recognizing	 an	 expanded
range	 of	 feelings	 and	 being	 able	 to	 put	 names	 to	 the m,	 and
empathizing.	 When	 she	 describes	 the	 evaluation	 resul ts	 of	 her
program’s	effects,	Lantieri	points	with	as	much	pride	to	the	in crease	in
“caring	 among	 the	 kids”	 as	 to	 the	 drops	 in	 fights,	 p ut-downs,	 and
======================================== [Página 305] ========================================

name-calling.
A	 similar	 convergence	 on	 emotional	 literacy	 occurred	 with	 a
consortium	of	psychologists	trying	to	find	ways	to	h elp	youngsters	on
a	 trajectory	 toward	 a	 life	 marked	 by	 crime	 and	 violen ce.	 Dozens	 of
studies	of	such	boys—as	we	saw	in	 Chapter	15 —yielded	a	clear	sense
of	the	path	most	take,	starting	from	impulsiveness	and 	a	quickness	to
anger	in	their	earliest	school	years,	through	becomi ng	social	rejects	by
the	 end	 of	 grade	 school,	 to	 bonding	 with	 a	 circle	 o f	 others	 like
themselves	and	beginning	crime	sprees	in	the	middle-sc hool	years.	By
early	 adulthood,	 a	 large	 portion	 of	 these	 boys	 have 	 acquired	 police
records	and	a	readiness	for	violence.
When	it	came	to	designing	interventions	that	might	he lp	such	boys
get	off	this	road	to	violence	and	crime,	the	result	 was,	once	again,	an
emotional-literacy	 program. 11	 One	 of	 these,	 developed	 by	 Carol
Kusche	along	with	Mark	Greenberg	at	the	University	of	Washin gton,	is
the	 PATHS	 curriculum	 (PATHS	 is	 the	 acronym	 for	 Promoting
Alternative	 Thinking	 Strategies).	 While	 those	 at	 ri sk	 for	 a	 trajectory
toward	 crime	 and	 violence	 are	 most	 in	 need	 of	 these	 l essons,	 the
course	is	given	to	all	those	in	a	class,	avoiding	a ny	stigmatizing	of	a
more	troubled	subgroup.
Still,	 the	 lessons	 are	 useful	 for	 all	 children.	 The se	 include,	 for
example,	 learning	 in	 the	 earliest	 school	 years	 to	 co ntrol	 their
impulses;	 lacking	 this	 ability,	 children	 have	 specia l	 trouble	 paying
attention	to	what	is	being	taught	and	so	fall	behin d	in	their	learning
and	 grades.	 Another	 is	 recognizing	 their	 feelings;	 the	 PATHS
curriculum	has	fifty	lessons	on	different	emotions,	t eaching	the	most
basic,	such	as	happiness	and	anger,	to	the	youngest 	children,	and	later
touching	 on	 more	 complicated	 feelings	 such	 as	 jealous y,	 pride,	 and
guilt.	The	emotional-awareness	lessons	include	how	t o	monitor	what
they	 and	 those	 around	 them	 are	 feeling,	 and—most	 import ant	 for
those	 prone	 to	 aggression—how	 to	 recognize	 when	 someo ne	 is
actually	hostile,	as	opposed	to	when	the	attributio n	of	hostility	comes
from	oneself.
One	of	the	most	important	lessons,	of	course,	is	ange r	management.
The	basic	premise	children	learn	about	anger	(and	al l	other	emotions
as	well)	is	that	“all	feelings	are	okay	to	have,”	b ut	some	reactions	are
okay	and	others	not.	Here	one	of	the	tools	for	teach ing	self-control	is
the	 same	 “stoplight”	 exercise	 used	 in	 the	 New	 Haven	 c ourse.	 Other
units	 help	 children	 with	 their	 friendships,	 a	 count er	 to	 the	 social
rejections	that	can	help	propel	a	child	toward	delinquency.

RETHINKING	SCHOOLS:	TEACHING	BY	BEING,	COMMUNITIES
THAT	CARE
As	 family	 life	 no	 longer	 offers	 growing	 numbers	 of	 ch ildren	 a	 sure
footing	in	life,	schools	are	left	as	the	one	place	 communities	can	turn
to	 for	 correctives	 to	 children’s	 deficiencies	 in	 emo tional	 and	 social
competence.	That	is	not	to	say	that	schools	alone	ca n	stand	in	for	all
the	 social	 institutions	 that	 too	 often	 are	 in	 or	 ne aring	 collapse.	 But
since	 virtually	 every	 child	 goes	 to	 school	 (at	 leas t	 at	 the	 outset),	 it
offers	a	place	to	reach	children	with	basic	lessons 	for	living	that	they
may	 never	 get	 otherwise.	 Emotional	 literacy	 implies	 an 	 expanded
mandate	 for	 schools,	 taking	 up	 the	 slack	 for	 failing 	 families	 in
socializing	 children.	 This	 daunting	 task	 requires	 t wo	 major	 changes:
that	teachers	go	beyond	their	traditional	mission	an d	that	people	in
the	community	become	more	involved	with	schools.
Whether	 or	 not	 there	 is	 a	 class	 explicitly	 devoted	 to	 emotional
literacy	may	matter	far	less	than	 how	these	lessons	are	taught.	There	is
perhaps	no	subject	where	the	quality	of	the	teacher 	matters	so	much,
since	how	a	teacher	handles	her	class	is	in	itself	 a	model,	a	de	facto
lesson	 in	 emotional	 competence—or	 the	 lack	 thereof.	 Wh enever	 a
teacher	responds	to	one	student,	twenty	or	thirty	others	lea rn	a	lesson.
There	 is	 a	 self-selection	 in	 the	 kind	 of	 teacher	 wh o	 gravitates	 to
courses	such	as	these,	because	not	everyone	is	suit ed	by	temperament.
To	begin	with,	teachers	need	to	be	comfortable	talki ng	about	feelings;
not	every	teacher	is	at	ease	doing	so	or	wants	to	b e.	There	is	little	or
nothing	in	the	standard	education	of	teachers	that	 prepares	them	for
this	kind	of	teaching.	For	these	reasons,	emotional	 literacy	programs
typically	give	prospective	teachers	several	weeks	o f	special	training	in
the	approach.
While	many	teachers	may	be	reluctant	at	the	outset	to 	tackle	a	topic
that	seems	so	foreign	to	their	training	and	routines ,	there	is	evidence
that	once	they	are	willing	to	try	it,	most	will	be	p leased	rather	than
put	 off.	 In	 the	 New	 Haven	 schools,	 when	 teachers	 fir st	 learned	 that
they	would	be	trained	to	teach	the	new	emotional	lit eracy	courses,	31
percent	said	they	were	reluctant	to	do	so.	After	a	 year	of	teaching	the
courses,	more	than	90	percent	said	they	were	pleased 	by	them,	and
wanted	to	teach	them	again	the	following	year.
AN	EXPANDED	MISSION	FOR	SCHOOLS
======================================== [Página 307] ========================================

Beyond	teacher	training,	emotional	literacy	expands	 our	vision	of	the
task	 of	 schools	 themselves,	 making	 them	 more	 explicitly 	 society’s
agent	for	seeing	that	children	learn	these	essentia l	lessons	for	life—a
return	to	a	classic	role	for	education.	This	larger 	design	requires,	apart
from	 any	 specifics	 of	 curriculum,	 using	 opportunities 	 in	 and	 out	 of
class	to	help	students	turn	moments	of	personal	crisi s	into	lessons	in
emotional	competence.	It	also	works	best	when	the	les sons	at	school
are	 coordinated	 with	 what	 goes	 on	 in	 children’s	 home s.	 Many
emotional	 literacy	 programs	 include	 special	 classes	 f or	 parents	 to
teach	 them	 about	 what	 their	 children	 are	 learning,	 n ot	 just	 to
complement	what	is	imparted	at	school,	but	to	help	par ents	who	feel
the	need	to	deal	more	effectively	with	their	children’s	emotio nal	life.
That	 way,	 children	 get	 consistent	 messages	 about	 emot ional
competence	in	all	parts	of	their	lives.	In	the	New	Ha ven	schools,	says
Tim	Shriver,	director	of	the	Social	Competence	Progra m,	“if	kids	get
into	a	beef	in	the	cafeteria,	they’ll	be	sent	to	a	 peer	mediator,	who	sits
down	 with	 them	 and	 works	 through	 their	 conflict	 with 	 the	 same
perspective-taking	 technique	 they	 learned	 in	 class. 	 Coaches	 will	 use
the	technique	to	handle	conflicts	on	the	playing	fi eld.	We	hold	classes
for	parents	in	using	these	methods	with	kids	at	home.”
Such	parallel	lines	of	reinforcement	of	these	emotion al	lessons—not
just	 in	 the	 classroom,	 but	 also	 on	 the	 playground;	 n ot	 just	 in	 the
school,	 but	 also	 in	 the	 home—is	 optimal.	 That	 means	 wea ving	 the
school,	 the	 parents,	 and	 the	 community	 together	 more	 t ightly.	 It
increases	 the	 likelihood	 that	 what	 children	 learned 	 in	 emotional
literacy	 classes	 will	 not	 stay	 behind	 at	 school,	 bu t	 will	 be	 tested,
practiced,	and	sharpened	in	the	actual	challenges	of	life.
Another	way	in	which	this	focus	reshapes	schools	is 	in	building	a
campus	 culture	 that	 makes	 it	 a	 “caring	 community,”	 a	 pl ace	 where
students	 feel	 respected,	 cared	 about,	 and	 bonded	 to 	 classmates,
teachers,	and	the	school	itself. 12	For	example,	schools	in	areas	such	as
New	Haven,	where	families	are	disintegrating	at	a	hig h	rate,	offer	a
range	of	programs	that	recruit	caring	people	in	the	 community	to	get
engaged	with	students	whose	home	life	is	shaky	at	be st.	In	the	New
Haven	 schools,	 responsible	 adults	 volunteer	 as	 mentor s,	 regular
companions	 for	 students	 who	 are	 foundering	 and	 who	 h ave	 few,	 if
any,	stable	and	nurturing	adults	in	their	home	life.
In	 short,	 the	 optimal	 design	 of	 emotional	 literacy	 pr ograms	 is	 to
begin	early,	be	age-appropriate,	run	throughout	the 	school	years,	and
intertwine	efforts	at	school,	at	home,	and	in	the	community.
======================================== [Página 308] ========================================

Even	though	much	of	this	fits	neatly	into	existing	parts	of	the 	school
day,	these	programs	are	a	major	change	in	any	curricu lum.	It	would
be	 naive	 not	 to	 anticipate	 hurdles	 in	 getting	 such	 programs	 into
schools.	Many	parents	may	feel	that	the	topic	itself 	is	too	personal	a
domain	for	the	schools,	that	such	things	are	best	le ft	to	parents	(an
argument	that	gains	credibility	to	the	extent	that	p arents	actually	do
address	 these	 topics—and	 is	 less	 convincing	 when	 the y	 fail	 to).
Teachers	may	be	reluctant	to	yield	yet	another	part	 of	the	school	day
to	topics	that	seem	so	unrelated	to	the	academic	basi cs;	some	teachers
may	be	too	uncomfortable	with	the	topics	to	teach	the m,	and	all	will
need	 special	 training	 to	 do	 so.	 Some	 children,	 too,	 will	 resist,
especially	to	the	extent	that	these	classes	are	out 	of	synch	with	their
actual	 concerns,	 or	 feel	 like	 intrusive	 impositions	 on	 their	 privacy.
And	 then	 there	 is	 the	 dilemma	 of	 maintaining	 high	 qual ity,	 and
ensuring	 that	 slick	 education	 marketers	 do	 not	 peddl e	 ineptly
designed	emotional-competence	programs	that	repeat	the 	disasters	of,
say,	ill-conceived	courses	on	drugs	or	teen	pregnancy.
Given	all	this,	why	should	we	bother	to	try?
DOES	EMOTIONAL	LITERACY	MAKE	A	DIFFERENCE?
It’s	every	teacher’s	nightmare:	one	day	Tim	Shriver	o pened	the	local
paper	 to	 read	 that	 Lamont,	 one	 of	 his	 favorite	 former 	 students,	 had
been	 shot	 nine	 times	 on	 a	 New	 Haven	 street,	 and	 was	 i n	 critical
condition.	“Lamont	had	been	one	of	the	school	leader s,	a	huge—six
foot	 two—and	 hugely	 popular	 linebacker,	 always	 smilin g,”	 recalls
Shriver.	“Back	then	Lamont	had	enjoyed	coming	to	a	le adership	club	I
led,	 where	 we	 would	 toss	 around	 ideas	 in	 a	 problem-s olving	 model
known	as	SOCS.”
The	 acronym	 is	 for	 Situation,	 Options,	 Consequence,	 Solutions—a
four-step	method:	say	what	the	situation	is	and	how	 it	makes	you	feel;
think	 about	 your	 options	 for	 solving	 the	 problem	 and 	 what	 their
consequences	 might	 be;	 pick	 a	 solution	 and	 execute	 i t—a	 grown-up
version	 of	 the	 stoplight	 method.	 Lamont,	 Shriver	 adde d,	 loved
brainstorming	imaginative	but	potentially	effective	ways	to 	handle	the
pressing	 dilemmas	 of	 high-school	 life,	 such	 as	 proble ms	 with
girlfriends	and	how	to	avoid	fights.
But	those	few	lessons	seemed	to	have	failed	him	after 	high	school.
Drifting	on	the	streets	in	a	sea	of	poverty,	drugs, 	and	guns,	Lamont	at
======================================== [Página 309] ========================================

twenty-six	 lay	 in	 a	 hospital	 bed,	 shrouded	 in	 banda ges,	 his	 body
riddled	 with	 bullet	 holes.	 Rushing	 to	 the	 hospital, 	 Shriver	 found
Lamont	 barely	 able	 to	 talk,	 his	 mother	 and	 girlfriend 	 huddled	 over
him.	Seeing	his	former	teacher,	Lamont	motioned	him	to	t he	bedside,
and	as	Shriver	leaned	over	to	hear,	whispered,	“Shr ive,	when	I	get	out
of	here,	I’m	gonna	use	the	SOCS	method.”
Lamont	went	through	Hillhouse	High	in	the	years	before 	the	social-
development	course	was	given	there.	Would	his	life	h ave	turned	out
differently	 had	 he	 benefited	 from	 such	 an	 education	 throughout	 his
school	years,	as	children	in	New	Haven	public	school s	do	now?	The
signs	point	to	a	possible	yes,	though	no	one	can	ever	say	for	su re.
As	Tim	Shriver	put	it,	“One	thing	is	clear:	the	prov ing	ground	for
social	problem-solving	is	not	just	the	classroom,	but 	the	cafeteria,	the
streets,	home.”	Consider	testimony	from	teachers	in	th e	New	Haven
program.	One	recounts	how	a	former	student,	still	sin gle,	visited	and
said	that	she	almost	certainly	would	have	been	an	un wed	mother	by
now	“if	she	hadn’t	learned	to	stand	up	for	her	righ ts	during	our	Social
Development	 classes.” 13	 Another	 teacher	 recalls	 how	 a	 student’s
relationship	with	her	mother	was	so	poor	that	their	 talks	continually
ended	up	as	screaming	matches;	after	the	girl	learned 	about	calming
down	and	thinking	before	reacting,	the	mother	told	h er	teacher	that
they	could	now	talk	without	going	“off	the	deep	end .”	At	the	Troup
school,	 a	 sixth	 grader	 passed	 a	 note	 to	 the	 teacher 	 of	 her	 Social
Development	class;	her	best	friend,	the	note	said,	w as	pregnant,	had
no	one	to	talk	to	about	what	to	do,	and	was	plannin g	suicide—but	she
knew	the	teacher	would	care.
A	 revealing	 moment	 came	 when	 I	 was	 observing	 a	 seventh -grade
class	 in	 social	 development	 in	 the	 New	 Haven	 Schools ,	 and	 the
teacher	asked	for	“someone	to	tell	me	about	a	disagre ement	they’ve
had	recently	that	ended	in	a	good	way.”
A	 plumpish	 twelve-year-old	 girl	 shot	 up	 her	 hand:	 “T his	 girl	 was
supposed	to	be	my	friend	and	someone	said	she	wanted	 to	fight	me.
They	told	me	she	was	going	to	get	me	in	a	corner	after	school.”
But	 instead	 of	 confronting	 the	 other	 girl	 in	 anger, 	 she	 applied	 an
approach	 encouraged	 in	 the	 class—finding	 out	 what	 is 	 going	 on
before	jumping	to	conclusions:	“So	I	went	to	the	gir l	and	I	asked	why
she	 said	 that	 stuff.	 And	 she	 said	 she	 never	 did.	 So 	 we	 never	 had	 a
fight.”
The	 story	 seems	 innocuous	 enough.	 Except	 that	 the	 gi rl	 who	 tells
the	tale	had	already	been	expelled	from	another	scho ol	for	fighting.	In
======================================== [Página 310] ========================================

the	past	she	attacked	first,	asked	questions	later—or	 not	at	all.	For	her
to	 engage	 a	 seeming	 adversary	 in	 a	 constructive	 way	 rather	 than
immediately	 wading	 into	 an	 angry	 confrontal	 is	 a	 small 	 but	 real
victory.
Perhaps	 the	 most	 telling	 sign	 of	 the	 impact	 of	 such	 e motional
literacy	classes	are	the	data	shared	with	me	by	the	 principal	of	this
twelve-year-old’s	 school.	 An	 unbendable	 rule	 there	 is	 that	 children
caught	 fighting	 are	 suspended.	 But	 as	 the	 emotional	 literacy	 classes
have	been	phased	in	over	the	years	there	has	been	a 	steady	drop	in
the	number	of	suspensions.	“Last	year,”	says	the	principal,	“ there	were
106	suspensions.	So	far	this	year—we’re	up	to	March–t here	have	been
only	26.”
These	are	concrete	benefits.	But	apart	from	such	ane cdotes	of	lives
bettered	 or	 saved,	 there	 is	 the	 empirical	 question	 o f	 how	 much
emotional	literacy	classes	really	matter	to	those	who	go	throu gh	them.
The	 data	 suggest	 that	 although	 such	 courses	 do	 not	 change	 anyone
overnight,	as	children	advance	through	the	curricul um	from	grade	to
grade,	there	are	discernible	improvements	in	the	tone 	of	a	school	and
the	 outlook—and	 level	 of	 emotional	 competence—of	 the	 gi rls	 and
boys	who	take	them.
There	 have	 been	 a	 handful	 of	 objective	 evaluations, 	 the	 best	 of
which	compare	students	in	these	courses	with	equival ent	students	not
taking	 them,	 with	 independent	 observers	 rating	 the	 c hildren’s
behavior.	 Another	 method	 is	 to	 track	 changes	 in	 the	 same	 students
before	 and	 after	 the	 courses	 based	 on	 objective	 meas ures	 of	 their
behavior,	 such	 as	 the	 number	 of	 schoolyard	 fights	 or 	 suspensions.
Pooling	such	assessments	reveals	a	widespread	benefi t	for	children’s
emotional	and	social	competence,	for	their	behavior	i n	and	out	of	the
classroom,	and	for	their	ability	to	learn	(see	 Appendix	F 	for	details):

performance.	This	is	not	an	isolated	finding;	it	rec urs	again	and	again
in	such	studies.	In	a	time	when	too	many	children	lac k	the	capacity	to
handle	 their	 upsets,	 to	 listen	 or	 focus,	 to	 rein	 in 	 impulse,	 to	 feel
responsible	for	their	work	or	care	about	learning,	 anything	that	will
buttress	 these	 skills	 will	 help	 in	 their	 education. 	 In	 this	 sense,
emotional	literacy	enhances	schools’	ability	to	teac h.	Even	in	a	time	of
back-to-basics	and	budget	cuts,	there	is	an	argument 	to	be	made	that
these	 programs	 help	 reverse	 a	 tide	 of	 educational	 de cline	 and
strengthen	 schools	 in	 accomplishing	 their	 main	 mission ,	 and	 so	 are
well	worth	the	investment.
Beyond	 these	 educational	 advantages,	 the	 courses	 se em	 to	 help
children	 better	 fulfill	 their	 roles	 in	 life,	 becomin g	 better	 friends,
students,	sons	and	daughters—and	in	the	future	are	mo re	likely	to	be
better	husbands	and	wives,	workers	and	bosses,	pare nts,	and	citizens.
While	 not	 every	 boy	 and	 girl	 will	 acquire	 these	 ski lls	 with	 equal
sureness,	to	the	degree	they	do	we	are	all	the	bett er	for	it.	“A	rising
tide	lifts	all	boats,”	as	Tim	Shriver	put	it.	“It’s	 not	just	the	kids	with
problems,	but	all	kids	who	can	benefit	from	these	ski lls;	these	are	an
inoculation	for	life.”
CHARACTER,	MORALITY,	AMD	THE	ARTS	Of	DEMOCRACY
There	is	an	old-fashioned	word	for	the	body	of	skil ls	that	emotional
intelligence	represents:	 character .	Character,	writes	Amitai	Etzioni,	the
George	 Washington	 University	 social	 theorist,	 is	 “t he	 psychological
muscle	that	moral	conduct	requires.” 14	And	philosopher	John	Dewey
saw	that	a	moral	education	is	most	potent	when	lesson s	are	taught	to
children	in	the	course	of	real	events,	not	just	as	 abstract	lessons—the
mode	of	emotional	literacy. 15
If	 character	 development	 is	 a	 foundation	 of	 democrati c	 societies,
consider	 some	 of	 the	 ways	 emotional	 intelligence	 butt resses	 this
foundation.	 The	 bedrock	 of	 character	 is	 self-discip line;	 the	 virtuous
life,	 as	 philosophers	 since	 Aristotle	 have	 observed ,	 is	 based	 on	 self-
control.	A	related	keystone	of	character	is	being	a ble	to	motivate	and
guide	oneself,	whether	in	doing	homework,	finishing	 a	job,	or	getting
up	 in	 the	 morning.	 And,	 as	 we	 have	 seen,	 the	 ability 	 to	 defer
gratification	and	to	control	and	channel	one’s	urge s	to	act	is	a	basic
emotional	skill,	one	that	in	a	former	day	was	called	 will.	“We	need	to
be	in	control	of	ourselves—our	appetites,	our	passio ns—to	do	right	by
======================================== [Página 313] ========================================

others,”	notes	Thomas	Lickona,	writing	about	charact er	education. 16
“It	takes	will	to	keep	emotion	under	the	control	of	reason.”
Being	able	to	put	aside	one’s	self-centered	focus	a nd	impulses	has
social	 benefits:	 it	 opens	 the	 way	 to	 empathy,	 to	 rea l	 listening,	 to
taking	another	person’s	perspective.	Empathy,	as	we	 have	seen,	leads
to	 caring,	 altruism,	 and	 compassion.	 Seeing	 things	 fr om	 another’s
perspective	breaks	down	biased	stereotypes,	and	so	 breeds	tolerance
and	acceptance	of	differences.	These	capacities	are 	ever	more	called
on	 in	 our	 increasingly	 pluralistic	 society,	 allowin g	 people	 to	 live
together	in	mutual	respect	and	creating	the	possibil ity	of	productive
public	discourse.	These	are	basic	arts	of	democracy. 17
Schools,	notes	Etzioni,	have	a	central	role	in	cult ivating	character
by	inculcating	self-discipline	and	empathy,	which	in 	turn	enable	true
commitment	to	civic	and	moral	values. 18	In	doing	so,	it	is	not	enough
to	 lecture	 children	 about	 values:	 they	 need	 to	 prac tice	 them,	 which
happens	as	children	build	the	essential	emotional	an d	social	skills.	In
this	 sense,	 emotional	 literacy	 goes	 hand	 in	 hand	 wit h	 education	 for
character,	for	moral	development,	and	for	citizenship.
A	LAST	WORD
As	 I	 complete	 this	 book	 some	 troubling	 newspaper	 ite ms	 catch	 my
eye.	One	announces	that	guns	have	become	the	number-o ne	cause	of
death	in	America,	edging	out	auto	accidents.	The	sec ond	says	that	last
year	 murder	 rates	 rose	 by	 3	 percent. 19	Particularly	disturbing	is	the
prediction	in	that	second	article,	by	a	criminologis t,	that	we	are	in	a
lull	before	a	“crime	storm”	to	come	in	the	next	decade .	The	reason	he
gives	is	that	murders	by	teenagers	as	young	as	fourt een	and	fifteen	are
on	 the	 rise,	 and	 that	 age	 group	 represents	 the	 cres t	 of	 a	 mini	 baby
boom.	In	the	next	decade	this	group	will	become	eight een-	to	twenty-
four-year-olds,	the	age	at	which	violent	crimes	peak 	in	the	course	of	a
criminal	career.	The	harbingers	are	on	the	horizon:	A	third	ar ticle	says
that	 in	 the	 four	 years	 between	 1988	 and	 1992	 Justic e	 Department
figures	 show	 a	 68	 percent	 jump	 in	 the	 number	 of	 juven iles	 charged
with	 murder,	 aggravated	 assault,	 robbery,	 and	 forcib le	 rape,	 with
aggravated	assault	alone	up	80	percent. 20
These	teenagers	are	 the	first	generation	 to	have	no t	 just	guns	but
automatic	 weaponry	 easily	 available	 to	 them,	 just	 as	 their	 parents’
generation	was	the	first	to	have	wide	access	to	dru gs.	The	toting	of
======================================== [Página 314] ========================================

guns	 by	 teenagers	 means	 that	 disagreements	 that	 in	 a	 former	 day
would	have	led	to	fistfights	can	readily	lead	to	sh ootings	instead.	And,
as	another	expert	points	out,	these	teenagers	“just 	aren’t	very	good	at
avoiding	disputes.”
One	reason	they	are	so	poor	at	this	basic	life	skil l,	of	course,	is	that
as	a	society	we	have	not	bothered	to	make	sure	every 	child	is	taught
the	essentials	of	handling	anger	or	resolving	confl icts	positively—nor
have	 we	 bothered	 to	 teach	 empathy,	 impulse	 control,	 o r	 any	 of	 the
other	 fundamentals	 of	 emotional	 competence.	 By	 leaving 	 the
emotional	 lessons	 children	 learn	 to	 chance,	 we	 risk	 largely	 wasting
the	window	of	opportunity	presented	by	the	slow	matu ration	of	the
brain	to	help	children	cultivate	a	healthy	emotional	reperto ire.
Despite	high	interest	in	emotional	literacy	among	some 	educators,
these	 courses	 are	 as	 yet	 rare;	 most	 teachers,	 princi pals,	 and	 parents
simply	do	not	know	they	exist.	The	best	models	are	largely	outsi de	the
education	 mainstream,	 in	 a	 handful	 of	 private	 schools 	 and	 a	 few
hundred	public	schools.	Of	course	no	program,	includ ing	this	one,	is
an	 answer	 to	 every	 problem.	 But	 given	 the	 crises	 we	 find	 ourselves
and	our	children	facing,	and	given	the	quantum	of	ho pe	held	out	by
courses	in	emotional	literacy,	we	must	ask	ourselves: 	Shouldn’t	we	be
teaching	these	most	essential	skills	for	life	to	eve ry	child—now	more
than	ever?
And	if	not	now,	when?

APPENDIX	A
What	Is	Emotion?
A	word	about	what	I	refer	to	under	the	rubric	 emotion ,	a	term	whose
precise	 meaning	 psychologists	 and	 philosophers	 have	 quibbled	 over
for	more	than	a	century.	In	its	most	literal	sense,	t he	Oxford	English
Dictionary 	 defines	emotion 	 as	 “any	 agitation	 or	 disturbance	 of	 mind,
feeling,	passion;	any	vehement	or	excited	mental	stat e.”	I	take	emotion
to	 refer	 to	 a	 feeling	 and	 its	 distinctive	 thoughts, 	 psychological	 and
biological	states,	and	range	of	propensities	to	act .	There	are	hundreds
of	 emotions,	 along	 with	 their	 blends,	 variations,	 mut ations,	 and
nuances.	Indeed,	there	are	many	more	subtleties	of	emo tion	than	we
have	words	for.
Researchers	continue	to	argue	over	precisely	which	 emotions	can	be
considered	primary—the	blue,	red,	and	yellow	of	feeli ng	from	which
all	 blends	 come—or	 even	 if	 there	 are	 such	 primary	 emoti ons	 at	 all.
Some	theorists	propose	basic	families,	though	not	all 	agree	on	them.
The	main	candidates	and	some	of	the	members	of	their	families:
•	Anger: 	fury,	outrage,	resentment,	wrath,	exasperation,	ind ignation,
vexation,	acrimony,	animosity,	annoyance,	irritabilit y,	hostility,	and,
perhaps	at	the	extreme,	pathological	hatred	and	violence
•	Sadness: 	grief,	sorrow,	cheerlessness,	gloom,	melancholy,	sel f-pity,
loneliness,	 dejection,	 despair,	 and,	 when	 pathologi cal,	 severe
depression
•	Fear: 	anxiety,	apprehension,	nervousness,	concern,	const ernation,
misgiving,	 wariness,	 qualm,	 edginess,	 dread,	 fright,	 terror;	 as	 a
psychopathology,	phobia	and	panic
•	Enjoyment: 	 happiness,	 joy,	 relief,	 contentment,	 bliss,	 delight ,
amusement,	 pride,	 sensual	 pleasure,	 thrill,	 rapture,	 gratification,
satisfaction,	euphoria,	whimsy,	ecstasy,	and	at	the	far	edge ,	mania
•	Love: 	 acceptance,	 friendliness,	 trust,	 kindness,	 affinit y,	 devotion,
adoration,	infatuation,	 agape
•	Surprise: 	shock,	astonishment,	amazement,	wonder
•	Disgust: 	 contempt,	 disdain,	 scorn,	 abhorrence,	 aversion,	 dis taste,
======================================== [Página 316] ========================================

revulsion
•	Shame: 	guilt,	embarrassment,	chagrin,	remorse,	humiliation,
regret,	mortification,	and	contrition
To	be	sure,	this	list	does	not	resolve	every	questi on	about	how	to
categorize	emotion.	For	example,	what	about	blends	su ch	as	jealousy,
a	variant	of	anger	that	also	melds	sadness	and	fear? 	And	what	of	the
virtues,	such	as	hope	and	faith,	courage	and	forgiv eness,	certainty	and
equanimity?	 Or	 some	 of	 the	 classic	 vices,	 feelings	 su ch	 as	 doubt,
complacency,	 sloth,	 and	 torpor—or	 boredom?	 There	 are	 n o	 clear
answers;	the	scientific	debate	on	how	to	classify	emotions	co ntinues.
The	argument	for	there	being	a	handful	of	core	emotio ns	hinges	to
some	 extent	 on	 the	 discovery	 by	 Paul	 Ekman,	 at	 the	 Un iversity	 of
California	at	San	Francisco,	that	specific	facial	e xpressions	for	four	of
them	 (fear,	 anger,	 sadness,	 enjoyment)	 are	 recognized 	 by	 people	 in
cultures	 around	 the	 world,	 including	 preliterate	 pe oples	 presumably
untainted	 by	 exposure	 to	 cinema	 or	 television—suggest ing	 their
universality.	Ekman	showed	facial	photos	portraying	 expressions	with
technical	precision	to	people	in	cultures	as	remote	 as	the	Fore	of	New
Guinea,	 an	 isolated	 Stone	 Age	 tribe	 in	 the	 remote	 hi ghlands,	 and
found	 people	 everywhere	 recognized	 the	 same	 basic	 emo tions.	 This
universality	of	facial	expressions	for	emotion	was	p robably	first	noted
by	 Darwin,	 who	 saw	 it	 as	 evidence	 the	 forces	 of	 evo lution	 had
stamped	these	signals	in	our	central	nervous	system.
In	seeking	basic	principles,	I	follow	Ekman	and	othe rs	in	thinking	of
emotions	in	terms	of	families	or	dimensions,	taking	the 	main	families
—anger,	sadness,	fear,	enjoyment,	love,	shame,	and	so	 on—as	cases	in
point	 for	 the	 endless	 nuances	 of	 our	 emotional	 life. 	 Each	 of	 these
families	 has	 a	 basic	 emotional	 nucleus	 at	 its	 core,	 w ith	 its	 relatives
rippling	out	from	there	in	countless	mutations.	In	th e	outer	ripples	are
moods ,	 which,	 technically	 speaking,	 are	 more	 muted	 and	 las t	 far
longer	than	an	emotion	(while	it’s	relatively	rare	t o	be	in	the	full	heat
of	anger	all	day,	for	example,	it	is	not	that	rare	t o	be	in	a	grumpy,
irritable	mood,	in	which	shorter	bouts	of	anger	are	 easily	triggered).
Beyond	 moods	 are	 temperaments ,	 the	 readiness	 to	 evoke	 a	 given
emotion	 or	 mood	 that	 makes	 people	 melancholy,	 timid,	 or	 cheery.
And	still	beyond	such	emotional	dispositions	are	the 	outright	disorders
of	 emotion	 such	 as	 clinical	 depression	 or	 unremitting	 a nxiety,	 in
which	someone	feels	perpetually	trapped	in	a	toxic	state.

APPENDIX	B
Hallmarks	of	the	Emotional	Mind
Only	 in	 recent	 years	 has	 there	 emerged	 a	 scientific	 model	 of	 the
emotional	 mind	 that	 explains	 how	 so	 much	 of	 what	 we	 do 	 can	 be
emotionally	driven—how	we	can	be	so	reasonable	at	one 	moment	and
so	 irrational	 the	 next—and	 the	 sense	 in	 which	 emotion s	 have	 their
own	reasons	and	their	own	logic.	Perhaps	the	two	be st	assessments	of
the	emotional	mind	are	offered	independently	by	Paul	 Ekman,	head	of
the	Human	Interaction	Laboratory	at	the	University	of 	California,	San
Francisco,	 and	 by	 Seymour	 Epstein,	 a	 clinical	 psycho logist	 at	 the
University	 of	 Massachusetts. 1	 While	 Ekman	 and	 Epstein	 have	 each
weighed	different	scientific	evidence,	together	the y	offer	a	basic	list	of
the	qualities	that	distinguish	emotions	from	the	rest	of	mental 	life. 2
A	Quick	but	Sloppy	Response
The	emotional	mind	is	far	quicker	than	the	rational	mi nd,	springing
into	 action	 without	 pausing	 even	 a	 moment	 to	 consider 	 what	 it	 is
doing.	Its	quickness	precludes	the	deliberate,	anal ytic	reflection	that	is
the	hallmark	of	the	thinking	mind.	In	evolution	this	 quickness	most
likely	revolved	around	that	most	basic	decision,	wha t	to	pay	attention
to,	and,	once	vigilant	while,	say,	confronting	anot her	animal,	making
split-second	 decisions	 like,	 Do	 I	 eat	 this,	 or	 does 	 it	 eat	 me?	 Those
organisms	that	had	to	pause	too	long	to	reflect	on	t hese	answers	were
unlikely	to	have	many	progeny	to	pass	on	their	slower-acting	g enes.
Actions	 that	 spring	 from	 the	 emotional	 mind	 carry	 a	 pa rticularly
strong	 sense	 of	 certainty,	 a	 by-product	 of	 a	 streaml ined,	 simplified
way	 of	 looking	 at	 things	 that	 can	 be	 absolutely	 bew ildering	 to	 the
rational	mind.	When	the	dust	settles,	or	even	in	mid- response,	we	find
ourselves	thinking,	“What	did	I	do	that	for?”—a	sign 	that	the	rational
mind	 is	 awakening	 to	 the	 moment,	 but	 not	 with	 the	 rapi dity	 of	 the
emotional	mind.
Since	 the	 interval	 between	 what	 triggers	 an	 emotion	 and	 its
eruption	can	be	virtually	instantaneous,	the	mechani sm	that	appraises
======================================== [Página 318] ========================================

perception	must	be	capable	of	great	speed,	even	in	b rain	time,	which
is	reckoned	in	thousandths	of	a	second.	This	apprai sal	of	the	need	to
act	 needs	 to	 be	 automatic,	 so	 rapid	 that	 it	 never	 en ters	 conscious
awareness. 3	This	quick-and-dirty	variety	of	emotional	response	sweeps
over	us	virtually	before	we	quite	know	what	is	happening.
This	rapid	mode	of	perception	sacrifices	accuracy	fo r	speed,	relying
on	 first	 impressions,	 reacting	 to	 the	 overall	 pictur e	 or	 the	 most
striking	 aspects.	 It	 takes	 things	 in	 at	 once,	 as	 a	 whole,	 reacting
without	 taking	 the	 time	 for	 thoughtful	 analysis.	 Viv id	 elements	 can
determine	 that	 impression,	 outweighing	 a	 careful	 eval uation	 of	 the
details.	The	great	advantage	is	that	the	emotional	mi nd	can	read	an
emotional	reality	(he’s	angry	with	me;	she’s	lying;	t his	is	making	him
sad)	 in	 an	 instant,	 making	 the	 intuitive	 snap	 judgmen ts	 that	 tell	 us
who	 to	 be	 wary	 of,	 who	 to	 trust,	 who’s	 in	 distress. 	 The	 emotional
mind	 is	 our	 radar	 for	 danger;	 if	 we	 (or	 our	 forebear s	 in	 evolution)
waited	 for	 the	 rational	 mind	 to	 make	 some	 of	 these	 jud gments,	 we
might	not	only	 be	wrong—we	might	 be	dead.	The	 drawback 	is	that
these	impressions	and	intuitive	judgments,	because	th ey	are	made	in
the	snap	of	a	finger,	may	be	mistaken	or	misguided.
Paul	 Ekman	 proposes	 that	 this	 quickness,	 in	 which	 emo tions	 can
overtake	us	before	we	are	quite	aware	they	have	sta rted,	is	essential
to	 their	 being	 so	 highly	 adaptive:	 they	 mobilize	 us	 to	 respond	 to
urgent	 events	 without	 wasting	 time	 pondering	 whether 	 to	 react	 or
how	 to	 respond.	 Using	 the	 system	 he	 developed	 for	 de tecting
emotions	 from	 subtle	 changes	 in	 facial	 expression,	 Ek man	 can	 track
microemotions	 that	 flit	 across	 the	 face	 in	 less	 than	 a	 half	 second.
Ekman	 and	 his	 collaborators	 have	 discovered	 that	 emot ional
expressions	begin	to	show	up	in	changes	in	facial	mu sculature	within
a	 few	 thousandths	 of	 a	 second	 after	 the	 event	 that	 triggers	 the
reaction,	 and	 that	 the	 physiological	 changes	 typica l	 of	 a	 given
emotion—like	 shunting	 blood	 flow	 and	 increasing	 heart 	 rate—also
take	only	fractions	of	a	second	to	begin.	This	swif tness	is	particularly
true	of	intense	emotion,	like	fear	of	a	sudden	threat.
Ekman	argues	that,	technically	speaking,	the	full	he at	of	emotion	is
very	 brief,	 lasting	 just	 seconds	 rather	 than	 minutes ,	 hours,	 or	 days.
His	 reasoning	 is	 that	 it	 would	 be	 maladaptive	 for	 an	 emotion	 to
capture	 the	 brain	 and	 body	 for	 a	 long	 time	 regardles s	 of	 changing
circumstance.	 If	 the	 emotions	 caused	 by	 a	 single	 even t	 invariably
continued	to	dominate	us	after	it	had	passed,	and	re gardless	of	what
else	was	happening	around	us,	then	our	feelings	wou ld	be	poor	guides
======================================== [Página 319] ========================================

to	action.	For	emotions	to	last	longer	the	trigger	mu st	be	sustained,	in
effect	 continually	 evoking	 the	 emotion,	 as	 when	 the	 loss	 of	 a	 loved
one	keeps	us	mourning.	When	feelings	persist	for	hou rs,	it	is	usually
as	moods,	a	muted	form.	Moods	set	an	affective	tone,	b ut	they	are	not
such	strong	shapers	of	how	we	perceive	and	act	as	i s	the	high	heat	of
full	emotion.
First	Feelings,	Second	Thoughts
Because	 it	 takes	 the	 rational	 mind	 a	 moment	 or	 two	 lon ger	 to
register	 and	 respond	 than	 it	 does	 the	 emotional	 mind, 	 the	 “first
impulse”	in	an	emotional	situation	is	the	heart’s,	no t	the	head’s.	There
is	 also	 a	 second	 kind	 of	 emotional	 reaction,	 slower	 than	 the	 quick-
response,	 which	 simmers	 and	 brews	 first	 in	 our	 though ts	 before	 it
leads	to	feeling.	This	second	pathway	to	triggering 	emotions	is	more
deliberate,	and	we	are	typically	quite	aware	of	the 	thoughts	that	lead
to	 it.	 In	 this	 kind	 of	 emotional	 reaction	 there	 is	 a 	 more	 extended
appraisal;	our	thoughts—cognition—play	the	key	role	i n	determining
what	emotions	will	be	roused.	Once	we	make	an	apprais al—“that	taxi
driver	is	cheating	me”	or	“this	baby	is	adorable,”	a 	fitting	emotional
response	 follows.	 In	 this	 slower	 sequence,	 more	 full y	 articulated
thought	 precedes	 feeling.	 More	 complicated	 emotions,	 like
embarrassment	or	apprehension	over	an	upcoming	exam,	fo llow	this
slower	route,	taking	seconds	or	minutes	to	unfold—the se	are	emotions
that	follow	from	thoughts.
By	contrast,	in	the	fast-response	sequence	feeling	 seems	to	precede
or	 be	 simultaneous	 with	 thought.	 This	 rapid-fire	 emot ional	 reaction
takes	over	in	situations	that	have	the	urgency	of	p rimal	survival.	This
is	the	power	of	such	rapid	decisions:	they	mobilize	 us	in	an	instant	to
rise	 to	 an	 emergency.	 Our	 most	 intense	 feelings	 are	 i nvoluntary
reactions;	 we	 cannot	 decide	 when	 they	 will	 erupt.	 “ Love,”	 wrote
Stendhal,	 “is	 like	 a	 fever	 that	 comes	 and	 goes	 indep endently	 of	 the
will.”	Not	just	love,	but	our	angers	and	fears,	as	 well,	sweep	over	us,
seeming	to	happen	tous	rather	than	being	our	choice. 	For	that	reason
they	can	offer	an	alibi:	“It	is	the	fact	that	 we	cannot	choose	the	emotions
which	we	have ,”	notes	Ekman,	that	allows	people	to	explain	away	t heir
actions	by	saying	they	were	in	the	grip	of	emotion. 4
Just	 as	 there	 are	 quick	 and	 slow	 paths	 to	 emotion—one 	 through
immediate	perception	and	the	other	through	reflective 	thought—there
are	 also	 emotions	 which	 come	 bidden.	 One	 example	 is	 in tentionally
======================================== [Página 320] ========================================

manipulated	 feeling,	 the	 actors’	 stock-in-trade,	 lik e	 the	 tears	 that
come	when	sad	memories	are	intentionally	milked	for	the ir	effect.	But
actors	are	simply	more	skilled	than	the	rest	of	us	at	the	intenti onal	use
of	 the	 second	 pathway	 to	 emotion,	 feeling	 via	 thinki ng.	 While	 we
cannot	easily	change	what	specific	emotions	a	certai n	kind	of	thought
will	trigger,	we	very	often	can,	and	do,	choose	wha t	to	think	about.
Just	 as	 a	 sexual	 fantasy	 can	 lead	 to	 sexual	 feeling s,	 so	 can	 happy
memories	cheer	us	up,	or	melancholy	thoughts	make	us	reflective.
But	 the	 rational	 mind	 usually	 does	 not	 decide	 what	 e motions	 we
“should”	 have.	 Instead,	 our	 feelings	 typically	 come	 to	 us	 as	 a	 fait
accompli.	What	the	rational	mind	can	ordinarily	contr ol	is	the	course
of	those	reactions.	A	few	exceptions	aside,	we	do	n ot	decide	when 	to
be	mad,	sad,	and	so	on.
A	Symbolic,	Childlike	Reality
The	logic	of	the	emotional	mind	is	 associative; 	it	takes	elements	that
symbolize	a	reality,	or	trigger	a	memory	of	it,	to	be	 the	same	as	that
reality.	That	is	why	similes,	metaphors,	and	images	sp eak	directly	to
the	 emotional	 mind,	 as	 do	 the	 arts—novels,	 film,	 poetry ,	 song,
theater,	opera.	Great	spiritual	teachers,	like	Budd ha	and	Jesus,	have
touched	their	disciples’	hearts	by	speaking	in	the	language 	of	emotion,
teaching	in	parables,	fables,	and	stories.	Indeed,	 religious	symbol	and
ritual	makes	little	sense	from	the	rational	point	of	 view;	it	is	couched
in	the	vernacular	of	the	heart.
This	 logic	 of	 the	 heart—of	 the	 emotional	 mind—is	 well-d escribed
by	Freud	in	his	concept	of	“primary	process”	thought ;	it	is	the	logic	of
religion	 and	 poetry,	 psychosis	 and	 children,	 dream	 a nd	 myth	 (as
Joseph	Campbell	put	it,	“Dreams	are	private	myths;	myth s	are	shared
dreams”).	The	primary	process	is	the	key	that	unlocks 	the	meanings	of
works	 like	 James	 Joyce’s	 Ulysses: 	 In	 primary	 process	 thought,	 loose
associations	determine	the	flow	of	a	narrative;	one	 object	symbolizes
another;	 one	 feeling	 displaces	 another	 and	 stands	 f or	 it;	 wholes	 are
condensed	 into	 parts.	 There	 is	 no	 time,	 no	 laws	 of	 c ause-and-effect.
Indeed,	 there	 is	 no	 such	 thing	 as	 “No”	 in	 the	 primar y	 process;
anything	is	possible.	The	psychoanalytic	method	is	i n	part	the	art	of
deciphering	and	unraveling	these	substitutions	in	meaning.
If	 the	 emotional	 mind	 follows	 this	 logic	 and	 its	 rule s,	 with	 one
element	standing	for	another,	things	need	not	necess arily	be	defined
by	 their	 objective	 identity:	 what	 matters	 is	 how	 the y	 are	perceived;
======================================== [Página 321] ========================================

things	 are	 as	 they	 seem.	 What	 something	 reminds	 us	 of	 can	 be	 far
more	important	than	what	it	“is.”	Indeed,	in	emotional 	life,	identities
can	be	like	a	hologram	in	the	sense	that	a	single	pa rt	evokes	a	whole.
As	Seymour	Epstein	points	out,	while	the	rational	min d	makes	logical
connections	 between	 causes	 and	 effects,	 the	 emotiona l	 mind	 is
indiscriminate,	 connecting	 things	 that	 merely	 have	 si milar	 striking
features. 5
There	are	many	ways	in	which	the	emotional	mind	is	chi ldlike,	the
more	 so	 the	 stronger	 the	 emotion	 grows.	 One	 way	 is	 categorical
thinking,	where	everything	is	in	black	and	white,	w ith	no	shades	of
gray;	 someone	 who	 is	 mortified	 about	 a	 faux	 pas	 might	 have	 the
immediate	thought,	“I	 always 	say	the	wrong	thing.”	Another	sign	of
this	 childlike	 mode	 is	 personalized 	 thinking,	 with	 events	 perceived
with	 a	 bias	 centering	 on	 oneself,	 like	 the	 driver	 w ho,	 after	 an
accident,	explained	that	“the	telephone	pole	came	straight	a t	me.”
This	 childlike	 mode	 is	 self-confirming ,	 suppressing	 or	 ignoring
memories	 or	 facts	 that	 would	 undermine	 its	 beliefs	 and 	 seizing	 on
those	 that	 support	 it.	 The	 beliefs	 of	 the	 rational	 mind	 are	 tentative;
new	evidence	can	disconfirm	one	belief	and	replace	 it	with	a	new	one
—it	 reasons	 by	 objective	 evidence.	 The	 emotional	 mind, 	 however,
takes	its	beliefs	to	be	absolutely	true,	and	so	discounts	any 	evidence	to
the	contrary.	That	is	why	it	is	so	hard	to	reason	w ith	someone	who	is
emotionally	upset:	no	matter	the	soundness	of	your	ar gument	from	a
logical	point	of	view,	it	carries	no	weight	if	it	i s	out	of	keeping	with
the	emotional	conviction	of	the	moment.	Feelings	are	s elf-justifying,
with	a	set	of	perceptions	and	“proofs”	all	their	own.
The	Past	Imposed	on	the	Present
When	 some	 feature	 of	 an	 event	 seems	 similar	 to	 an	 emot ionally
charged	 memory	 from	 the	 past,	 the	 emotional	 mind	 respond s	 by
triggering	 the	 feelings	 that	 went	 with	 the	 remembered 	 event.	 The
emotional	mind	reacts	to	the	present	 as	though	it	were	the	past .6	 The
trouble	is	that,	especially	when	the	appraisal	is	f ast	and	automatic,	we
may	not	realize	that	what	was	once	the	case	is	no	lo nger	so.	Someone
who	has	learned,	through	painful	childhood	beatings ,	to	react	to	an
angry	scowl	with	intense	fear	and	loathing	will	hav e	that	reaction	to
some	degree	even	as	an	adult,	when	the	scowl	carries	no	such	thr eat.
If	 the	 feelings	 are	 strong,	 then	 the	 reaction	 that	 is	 triggered	 is
obvious.	 But	 if	 the	 feelings	 are	 vague	 or	 subtle,	 w e	 may	 not	 quite
======================================== [Página 322] ========================================

realize	the	emotional	reaction	we	are	having,	even	t hough	it	is	subtly
coloring	how	we	react	to	the	moment.	Thoughts	and	rea ctions	at	this
moment	 will	 take	 on	 the	 coloration	 of	 thoughts	 and	 re actions	 then,
even	 though	 it	 may	 seem	 that	 the	 reaction	 is	 due	 sole ly	 to	 the
circumstance	 of	 the	 moment.	 Our	 emotional	 mind	 will	 harn ess	 the
rational	 mind	 to	 its	 purposes,	 so	 we	 come	 up	 with	 exp lanations	 for
our	feelings	and	reactions—rationalizations—justifyin g	them	in	terms
of	 the	 present	 moment,	 without	 realizing	 the	 influenc e	 of	 the
emotional	 memory.	 In	 that	 sense,	 we	 can	 have	 no	 idea	 o f	 what	 is
actually	 going	 on,	 though	 we	 may	 have	 the	 conviction 	 of	 certainty
that	 we	 know	 exactly	 what	 is	 happening.	 At	 such	 momen ts	 the
emotional	mind	has	entrained	the	rational	mind,	puttin g	it	to	its	own
uses.
State-specific	Reality
The	working	of	the	emotional	mind	is	to	a	large	degree	 state-specific ,
dictated	by	the	particular	feeling	ascendant	at	a	g iven	moment.	How
we	 think	 and	 act	 when	 we	 are	 feeling	 romantic	 is	 ent irely	 different
from	how	we	behave	when	enraged	or	dejected;	in	the	 mechanics	of
emotion,	 each	 feeling	 has	 its	 own	 distinct	 repertoir e	 of	 thought,
reactions,	 even	 memories.	 These	 state-specific	 repert oires	 become
most	predominant	in	moments	of	intense	emotion.
One	sign	that	such	a	repertoire	is	active	is	select ive	memory.	Part	of
the	mind’s	response	to	an	emotional	situation	is	to	 reshuffle	memory
and	options	for	action	so	that	those	most	relevant	a re	at	the	top	of	the
hierarchy	 and	 so	 more	 readily	 enacted.	 And,	 as	 we	 ha ve	 seen,	 each
major	 emotion	 has	 its	 hallmark	 biological	 signature,	 a 	 pattern	 of
sweeping	 changes	 that	 entrain	 the	 body	 as	 that	 emoti on	 becomes
ascendant,	and	a	unique	set	of	cues	the	body	automat ically	sends	out
when	in	its	grip. 7

APPENDIX	C
The	Neural	Circuitry	of	Fear
The	amygdala	is	central	to	fear.	When	a	rare	brain	d isease	destroyed
the	 amygdala	 (but	 no	 other	 brain	 structures)	 in	 the	 patient
neurologists	call	“S.M.,”	fear	disappeared	from	her	 mental	repertoire.
She	became	unable	to	identify	looks	of	fear	on	other 	people’s	faces,
nor	to	make	such	an	expression	herself.	As	her	neuro logist	put	it,	“If
someone	put	a	gun	to	S.M.’s	head,	she	would	know	int ellectually	to	be
afraid	but	she	would	not	feel	afraid	as	you	or	I	would.”
Neuroscientists	have	mapped	the	circuitry	for	fear	i n	perhaps	finest
detail,	though	at	the	present	state	of	this	art	the 	full	circuitry	for	none
of	the	emotions	is	completely	surveyed.	Fear	is	an	apt	case	in	po int	for
understanding	the	neural	dynamics	of	emotion.	Fear,	i n	evolution,	has
a	 special	 prominence:	 perhaps	 more	 than	 any	 other	 emot ion	 it	 is
crucial	for	survival.	Of	course	in	modern	times	mispla ced	fears	are	the
bane	of	daily	life,	leaving	us	suffering	from	frets, 	angst,	and	garden
variety	 worries—or	 at	 pathological	 extreme,	 from	 panic 	 attacks,
phobias,	or	obsessive-compulsive	disorder.
Say	you’re	alone	one	night	at	home,	reading	a	book,	 when	suddenly
you	hear	a	crash	in	another	room.	What	happens	in	yo ur	brain	over
the	 next	 moments	 offers	 a	 window	 into	 the	 neural	 circ uitry	 of	 fear,
and	 the	 role	 of	 the	 amygdala	 as	 an	 alarm	 system.	 The	 f irst	 brain
circuit	involved	simply	takes	in	that	sound	as	raw	p hysical	waves	and
transforms	 them	 into	 the	 language	 of	 the	 brain	 to	 sta rtle	 you	 into
alertness.	This	circuit	goes	from	the	ear	to	the	bra instem	and	then	to
the	thalamus.	From	there	two	branches	separate:	a	smal ler	bundle	of
projections	 leads	 to	 the	 amygdala	 and	 the	 nearby	 hip pocampus;	 the
other,	 larger	 pathway	 leads	 to	 the	 auditory	 cortex	 in	 the	 temporal
lobe,	where	sounds	are	sorted	out	and	comprehended.
The	hippocampus,	a	key	storage	site	for	memory,	quickl y	sorts	that
“crash”	 against	 other	 similar	 sounds	 you’ve	 heard,	 t o	 see	 if	 it	 is
familiar—is	 this	 “crash”	 one	 that	 you	 immediately	 recog nize?
Meanwhile	the	auditory	cortex	is	doing	a	more	sophis ticated	analysis
of	the	sound	to	try	to	understand	its	source—is	it	t he	cat?	A	shutter
======================================== [Página 324] ========================================

banging	in	the	wind?	A	prowler?	The	auditory	cortex 	comes	up	with
its	hypothesis—it	might	be	the	cat	knocking	a	lamp	off 	the	table,	say,
but	 it	 might	 also	 be	 a	 prowler—and	 sends	 that	 message	 to	 the
amygdala	 and	 hippocampus,	 which	 quickly	 compare	 it	 to	 similar
memories.
If	 the	 conclusion	 is	 reassuring	 (it’s	 only	 the	 shut ter	 that	 bangs
whenever	it	gets	too	windy)	then	the	general	alert	 does	not	escalate	to
the	 next	 level.	 But	 if	 you	 are	 still	 unsure,	 anothe r	 coil	 of	 circuitry
reverberating	 between	 amygdala,	 hippocampus,	 and	 the	 prefrontal
cortex	further	heightens	your	uncertainty	and	fixat es	your	attention,
making	you	even	more	concerned	about	identifying	the	 source	of	the
sound.	If	no	satisfying	answer	comes	from	this	furthe r	keen	analysis,
the	 amygdala	 triggers	 an	 alarm,	 its	 central	 area	 acti vating	 the
hypothalamus,	the	brainstem,	and	the	autonomic	nervous	system.
The	superb	architecture	of	the	amygdala	as	a	central 	alarm	system
for	 the	 brain	 becomes	 evident	 in	 this	 moment	 of	 appreh ension	 and
subliminal	 anxiety.	 The	 several	 bundles	 of	 neurons	 i n	 the	 amygdala
each	 have	 a	 distinct	 set	 of	 projections	 with	 recept ors	 primed	 for
different	 neurotransmitters,	 something	 like	 those	 home 	 alarm
companies	where	operators	stand	at	the	ready	to	send 	out	calls	to	the
local	 fire	 department,	 police,	 and	 a	 neighbor	 whenev er	 a	 home
security	system	signals	trouble.
Different	parts	of	the	amygdala	receive	differing	informatio n.	To	the
amygdala’s	 lateral	 nucleus	 come	 projections	 from	 the	 t halamus	 and
auditory	and	visual	cortices.	Smells,	via	the	olfact ory	bulb,	come	to
the	corticomedial	area	of	the	amygdala,	and	tastes	an d	messages	from
the	viscera	go	 to	the	central	 area.	These	incoming	 s ignals	make	the
amygdala	a	continual	sentinel,	scrutinizing	every	sensory	e xperience.
From	 the	 amygdala	 projections	 extend	 out	 to	 every	 majo r	 part	 of
the	 brain.	 From	 the	 central	 and	 medial	 areas	 a	 branch 	 goes	 to	 the
areas	of	the	hypothalamus	that	secrete	the	body’s	eme rgency-response
substance,	 corticotropin-releasing	 hormone	 (CRH),	 whi ch	 mobilizes
the	 fight-or-flight	 reaction	 via	 a	 cascade	 of	 other 	 hormones.	 The
amygdala’s	 basal	 area	 sends	 out	 branches	 to	 the	 corp us	 striatum,
linking	 into	 the	 brain’s	 system	 for	 movement.	 And,	 via 	 the	 nearby
central	nucleus,	the	amygdala	sends	signals	to	the	a utonomic	nervous
system	via	the	medulla,	activating	a	wide	range	of	fa r-flung	responses
in	the	cardiovascular	system,	the	muscles,	and	the	gut.
From	 the	 amygdala’s	 basolateral	 area,	 arms	 go	 to	 the	 c ingulate
cortex	 and	 to	 the	 fibers	 known	 as	 the	 “central	 gray ,”	 cells	 that
======================================== [Página 325] ========================================

regulate	the	large	muscles	of	the	skeleton.	It	is	th ese	cells	that	make	a
dog	snarl	or	that	arch	the	back	of	a	cat	threatenin g	an	interloper	on
its	territory.	In	humans	these	same	circuits	tighten	 the	muscles	of	the
vocal	cords,	creating	the	high-pitched	voice	of	fright.
Still	another	pathway	from	the	amygdala	leads	to	the	 locus	ceruleus
in	 the	 brainstem,	 which	 in	 turn	 manufactures	 norepine phrine	 (also
called	“noradrenaline”)	and	disperses	it	throughout 	the	brain.	The	net
effect	 of	 norepinephrine	 is	 to	 heighten	 the	 overall 	 reactivity	 of	 the
brain	areas	that	receive	it,	making	the	sensory	cir cuits	more	sensitive.
Norepinephrine	 suffuses	 the	 cortex,	 the	 brainstem,	 a nd	 the	 limbic
system	 itself,	 in	 essence	 setting	 the	 brain	 on	 edge. 	 Now	 even	 the
ordinary	 creaking	 of	 the	 house	 can	 send	 a	 tremor	 of	 fear	 coursing
through	you.	Most	of	these	changes	go	on	outside	aw areness,	so	that
you	are	not	yet	aware	you	feel	fear.
But	as	you	begin	to	actually	feel	fear—that	is,	as	t he	anxiety	that
had	 been	 unconscious	 pierces	 awareness—the	 amygdala	 s eamlessly
commands	a	wide-ranging	response.	It	signals	cells	in	the	brai nstem	to
put	 a	 fearful	 expression	 on	 your	 face,	 make	 you	 edgy 	 and	 easily
startled,	 freeze	 unrelated	 movements	 your	 muscles	 had	 underway,
speed	 your	 heart	 rate	 and	 raise	 your	 blood	 pressure ,	 and	 slow	 your
breathing	 (you	 may	 notice	 yourself	 suddenly	 holding	 your	 breath
when	you	first	feel	fearful,	all	the	better	to	hear 	more	clearly	what	it
is	 you	 are	 fearful	 of).	 That	 is	 only	 one	 part	 of	 a	 wide,	 carefully
coordinated	 array	 of	 changes	 the	 amygdala	 and	 connec ted	 areas
orchestrate	as	they	commandeer	the	brain	in	a	crisis.
Meanwhile	 the	 amygdala,	 along	 with	 the	 interconnecte d
hippocampus,	 directs	 the	 cells	 that	 send	 key	 neurotr ansmitters,	 for
example,	to	trigger	releases	of	dopamine	that	lead	to 	the	riveting	of
attention	 on	 the	 source	 of	 your	 fear—the	 strange	 sou nds—and	 put
your	muscles	at	readiness	to	react	accordingly.	At	t he	same	time	the
amygdala	signals	sensory	areas	for	vision	and	attent ion,	making	sure
that	the	eyes	seek	out	whatever	is	most	relevant	to	 the	emergency	at
hand.	Simultaneously	cortical	memory	systems	are	reshuf fled	so	that
knowledge	 and	 memories	 most	 relevant	 to	 the	 particular 	 emotional
urgency	 will	 be	 most	 readily	 recalled,	 taking	 preced ence	 over	 other
less	relevant	strands	of	thought.
Once	these	signals	have	been	sent,	you	are	pitched	 into	full-fledged
fear:	 you	 become	 aware	 of	 the	 characteristic	 tightne ss	 in	 your	 gut,
your	speeding	heart,	the	tightening	of	the	muscles	a round	your	neck
and	 shoulders	 or	 the	 trembling	 of	 your	 limbs;	 your	 bo dy	 freezes	 in
======================================== [Página 326] ========================================

place	 as	 you	 strain	 your	 attention	 to	 hear	 any	 furt her	 sounds,	 and
your	mind	races	with	possible	lurking	dangers	and	wa ys	to	respond.
This	entire	sequence—from	surprise	to	uncertainty	to	 apprehension	to
fear—can	be	telescoped	within	a	second	or	so.	(For	mo re	information,

Acknowledgments
My	wife,	Tara	Bennett-Goleman,	a	psychotherapist,	wa s	a	full	creative
partner	 in	 the	 earliest	 stages	 of	 thinking	 that	 led 	 to	 this	 book.	 Her
attunement	to	the	emotional	currents	that	move	beneath 	the	surface
of	our	thoughts	and	interactions	opened	a	world	to	me.
I	first	heard	the	phrase	“emotional	literacy”	from	Ei leen	Rockefeller
Growald,	 then	 the	 founder	 and	 president	 of	 the	 Inst itute	 for	 the
Advancement	 of	 Health.	 It	 was	 this	 casual	 conversatio n	 that	 piqued
my	 interest	 and	 framed	 the	 investigations	 that	 finall y	 became	 this
book.
Support	from	the	Fetzer	Institute	has	allowed	me	the	 luxury	of	time
to	explore	more	fully	what	“emotional	literacy”	might	 mean,	and	I	am
grateful	for	the	crucial	early	encouragement	of	Rob	 Lehman,	president
of	 the	 Institute,	 and	 an	 ongoing	 collaboration	 with 	 David	 Sluyter,
program	 director	 there.	 It	 was	 Rob	 Lehman	 who,	 early	 on	 in	 my
explorations,	urged	me	to	write	a	book	about	emotional	literac y.
Among	my	most	profound	debts	is	to	the	hundreds	of	res earchers
who	 over	 the	 years	 have	 shared	 their	 findings	 with	 me,	 and	 whose
efforts	are	reviewed	and	synthesized	here.	To	Peter 	Salovey	at	Yale	I
owe	the	concept	of	“emotional	intelligence.”	I	have	 also	gained	much
from	 being	 privy	 to	 the	 ongoing	 work	 of	 many	 educator s	 and
practitioners	of	the	art	of	primary	prevention,	who	 are	at	the	forefront
of	the	nascent	movement	in	emotional	literacy.	Their	h ands-on	efforts
to	bring	heightened	social	and	emotional	skills	to	c hildren,	and	to	re-
create	 schools	 as	 more	 humane	 environments,	 have	 been	 inspiring.
Among	 them	 are	 Mark	 Greenberg	 and	 David	 Hawkins	 at	 the
University	 of	 Washington;	 Eric	 Schaps	 and	 Catherine 	 Lewis	 at	 the

PART	ONE:	THE	EMOTIONAL	BRAIN
Chapter	1.	What	Are	Emotions	For?
			1.	Associated	Press,	September	15,	1993.
			2.	The	timelessness	of	this	theme	of	selfless	love	is	suggeste d	by	how	pervasive	it	is	in	world
myth:	The	Jataka	tales,	told	throughout	much	of	Asia	for	mille nnia,	all	narrate	variations
on	such	parables	of	self-sacrifice.
	 	 	 3. 	 Altruistic	 love	 and	 human	 survival:	 The	 evolutionary	 t heories	 that	 posit	 the	 adaptive
advantages	of	altruism	are	well-summarized	in	Malcolm	Sl avin	and	Daniel	Kriegman,	 The
Adaptive	Design	of	the	Human	Psyche 	(New	York:	Guilford	Press,	1992).
			4. 	 Much	 of	 this	 discussion	 is	 based	 on	 Paul	 Ekman’s	 key	 e ssay,	 “An	 Argument	 for	 Basic
Emotions,”	Cognition	and	Emotion ,	6,	1992,	pp.	169–200.	This	point	is	from	P.	N.	Johnson-
Laird	and	K.	Oatley’s	essay	in	the	same	issue	of	the	j ournal.
			5.	The	shooting	of	Matilda	Crabtree:	 The	New	York	Times ,	Nov.	11,	1994.
			6.	Only	in	adults:	An	observation	by	Paul	Ekman,	Unive rsity	of	California	at	San	Francisco.
	 	 	 7. 	 Body	 changes	 in	 emotions	 and	 their	 evolutionary	 reaso ns:	 Some	 of	 the	 changes	 are
documented	 in	 Robert	 W.	 Levenson,	 Paul	 Ekman,	 and	 Wal lace	 V.	 Friesen,	 “Voluntary
Facial	 Action	 Generates	 Emotion-Specific	 Autonomous	 Ne rvous	 System	 Activity,”
Psychophysiology ,	27,	1990.	This	list	is	culled	from	there	and	other	sou rces.	At	this	point
such	 a	 list	 remains	 speculative	 to	 a	 degree;	 there	 is	 scientific	 debate	 over	 the	 precise
biological	signature	of	each	emotion,	with	some	researche rs	taking	the	position	that	there
is	far	more	overlap	than	difference	among	emotions,	or	tha t	our	present	ability	to	measure
the	biological	correlates	of	emotion	is	too	immature	to	 distinguish	among	them	reliably.
For	this	debate	see:	Paul	Ekman	and	Richard	Davidson,	 eds.,	Fundamental	Questions	About
Emotions 	(New	York:	Oxford	University	Press,	1994).
			8.	As	Paul	Ekman	puts	it,	“Anger	is	the	most	dangerous	e motion;	some	of	the	main	problems
destroying	society	these	days	involve	anger	run	amok. 	It’s	the	least	adaptive	emotion	now
because	 it	 mobilizes	 us	 to	 fight.	 Our	 emotions	 evolved	 when	 we	 didn’t	 have	 the
technology	 to	 act	 so	 powerfully	 on	 them.	 In	 prehistoric	 times,	 when	 you	 had	 an
instantaneous	rage	and	for	a	second	wanted	to	kill	s omeone,	you	couldn’t	do	it	very	easily
—but	now	you	can.”
			9.	Erasmus	of	Rotterdam,	 In	Praise	of	Folly ,	trans.	Eddie	Radice	(London:	Penguin,	1971),	p.
87.
10.	 Such	 basic	 responses	 defined	 what	 might	 pass	 for	 the	 “emot ional	 life”—more	 aptly,	 an
“instinct	 life”—of	 these	 species.	 More	 important	 in	 evo lutionary	 terms,	 these	 are	 the
decisions	 crucial	 to	 survival;	 those	 animals	 that	 coul d	 do	 them	 well,	 or	 well	 enough,
======================================== [Página 347] ========================================

survived	to	pass	on	their	genes.	In	these	early	times, 	mental	life	was	brutish:	the	senses
and	a	simple	repertoire	of	reactions	to	the	stimuli	they 	received	got	a	lizard,	frog,	bird,	or
fish—and,	perhaps,	a	brontosaurus—through	the	day.	But	this	 runt	brain	did	not	yet	allow
for	what	we	think	of	as	an	emotion.
11.	The	limbic	system	and	emotions:	R.	Joseph,	 The	Naked	Neuron:	Evolution	and	the	Languages
of	the	Brain	and	Body 	(New	York:	Plenum	Publishing,	1993);	Paul	D.	MacLean ,	The	Triune
Brain	in	Evolution 	(New	York:	Plenum,	1990).

M.D.,	 Departments	 of	 Psychology	 and	 Psychiatry,	 Univers ity	 of	 Wisconsin,	 prepared	 for

Chapter	2.	Anatomy	of	an	Emotional	Hijacking
			1.	The	case	of	the	man	with	no	feelings	was	described	by	R.	 Joseph,	op.	cit.	p.	83.	On	the
other	hand,	there	may	be	some	vestiges	of	feeling	in	peop le	who	lack	an	amygdala	(see
Paul	 Ekman	 and	 Richard	 Davidson,	 eds.,	 Questions	About	Emotion .	 New	 York:	 Oxford
University	Press,	1994).	The	different	findings	may	hinge	 on	exactly	which	parts	of	the
amygdala	and	related	circuits	were	missing;	the	last	w ord	on	the	detailed	neurology	of
emotion	is	far	from	in.
			2.	Like	many	neuroscientists,	LeDoux	works	at	several	 levels,	studying,	for	instance,	how
specific	lesions	in	a	rat’s	brain	change	its	behavior; 	painstakingly	tracing	the	path	of	single
neurons;	setting	up	elaborate	experiments	to	conditi on	fear	in	rats	whose	brains	have	been
surgically	altered.	His	findings,	and	others	reviewed 	here,	are	at	the	frontier	of	exploration
in	neuroscience,	and	so	remain	somewhat	speculative—par ticularly	the	implications	that
seem	to	flow	from	the	raw	data	to	an	understanding	of	our 	emotional	life.	But	LeDoux’s
work	 is	 supported	 by	 a	 growing	 body	 of	 converging	 ev idence	 from	 a	 variety	 of
neuroscientists	who	are	steadily	laying	bare	the	neur al	underpinnings	of	emotions.	See,	for
example,	Joseph	LeDoux,	“Sensory	Systems	and	Emotion,”	 Integrative	Psychiatry ,	4,	1986;
Joseph	 LeDoux,	 “Emotion	 and	 the	 Limbic	 System	 Concept,”	 Concepts	in	Neuroscience,	2 ,
1992.
	 	 	 3. 	 The	 idea	 of	 the	 limbic	 system	 as	 the	 brain’s	 emotional	 cen ter	 was	 introduced	 by
neurologist	 Paul	 MacLean	 more	 than	 forty	 years	 ago.	 In 	 recent	 years	 discoveries	 like
LeDoux’s	 have	 refined	 the	 limbic	 system	 concept,	 showing	 that	 some	 of	 its	 central
structures	 like	 the	 hippocampus	 are	 less	 directly	 invo lved	 in	 emotions,	 while	 circuits
linking	other	parts	of	 the	 brain—particularly	 the	 prefron tal	 lobes—to	 the	 amygdala	 are
more	central.	Beyond	that,	there	is	a	growing	recogniti on	that	each	emotion	may	call	on
distinct	brain	areas.	The	most	current	thinking	is	that	 there	is	not	a	neatly	defined	single
“emotional	brain,”	but	rather	several	systems	of	circui ts	that	disperse	the	regulation	of	a
given	emotion	to	farflung,	but	coordinated,	parts	of	the 	brain.	Neuroscientists	speculate
that	when	the	full	brain	mapping	of	the	emotions	is	accompli shed,	each	major	emotion
======================================== [Página 348] ========================================

will	have	its	own	topography,	a	distinct	map	of	neurona l	pathways	determining	its	unique
qualities,	 though	 many	 or	 most	 of	 these	 circuits	 are	 like ly	 to	 be	 interlinked	 at	 key
junctures	 in	 the	 limbic	 system,	 like	 the	 amygdala,	 and	 p refrontal	 cortex.	 See	 Joseph
LeDoux,	 “Emotional	 Memory	 Systems	 in	 the	 Brain,”	 Behavioral	and	Brain	Research ,	 58,
1993.

in	Jerome	Kagan,	 Galen’s	Prophecy 	(New	York:	Basic	Books,	1994).
			5.	I	wrote	about	Joseph	LeDoux’s	research	in	 The	New	York	Times 	on	August	15,	1989.	The
discussion	 in	 this	 chapter	 is	 based	 on	 interviews	 wit h	 him,	 and	 several	 of	 his	 articles,
including	 Joseph	 LeDoux,	 “Emotional	 Memory	 Systems	 in	 t he	 Brain,”	Behavioural	Brain

11.	 Much	 of	 this	 speculation	 about	 the	 fine-tuning	 of	 emotion al	 response	 by	 the	 neocortex
comes	from	Ned	Kalin,	op.	cit.
12.	 A	 closer	 look	 at	 the	 neuroanatomy	 shows	 how	 the	 prefron tal	 lobes	 act	 as	 emotional
managers.	Much	evidence	points	to	part	of	the	prefrontal 	cortex	as	a	site	where	most	or	all
cortical	circuits	involved	in	an	emotional	reaction	 come	together.	In	humans,	the	strongest
connections	 between	 neocortex	 and	 amygdala	 run	 to	 the 	 left	 prefrontal	 lobe	 and	 the
temporal	lobe	below	and	to	the	side	of	the	frontal	lobe	 (the	temporal	lobe	is	critical	in
identifying	 what	 an	 object	 is).	 Both	 these	 connections	 are	 made	 in	 a	 single	 projection,
suggesting	 a	 rapid	 and	 powerful	 pathway,	 a	 virtual	 ne ural	 highway.	 The	 single-neuron
projection	 between	 the	 amygdala	 and	 prefrontal	 cortex	 runs	 to	 an	 area	 called	 the
orbitofrontal	cortex .	 This	 is	 the	 area	 that	 seems	 most	 critical	 for	 assessing 	 emotional
responses	as	we	are	in	the	midst	of	them	and	making	mid-c ourse	corrections.
	 	 	 	 The	 orbitofrontal	 cortex	 both	 receives	 signals	 from	 the	 amygdala	 and	 has	 its	 own
======================================== [Página 349] ========================================

intricate,	extensive	web	of	projections	throughout	the	 limbic	brain.	Through	this	web	it
plays	 a	 role	 in	 regulating	 emotional	 responses—includ ing	 inhibiting	 signals	 from	 the
limbic	brain	as	they	reach	other	areas	of	the	cortex,	thus 	toning	down	the	neural	urgency
of	those	signals.	The	orbitofrontal	cortex’s	connections 	to	the	limbic	brain	are	so	extensive
that	some	neuroanatomists	have	called	it	a	kind	of	“limbi c	cortex”—the	thinking	part	of
the	emotional	brain.	See	Ned	Kalin,	Departments	of	Psyc hology	and	Psychiatry,	University
of	Wisconsin,	“Aspects	of	Emotion	Conserved	Across	Spe cies,”	an	unpublished	manuscript
prepared	for	the	MacArthur	Affective	Neuroscience	Meetin g.	November,	1992;	and	Allan
Schore,	Affect	Regulation	and	the	Origin	of	Self 	(Hillsdale,	NJ:	Lawrence	Erlbaum	Associates,
1994).
				There	is	not	only	a	structural	bridge	between	amyg dala	and	prefrontal	cortex,	but,	as
always,	a	biochemical	one:	both	the	ventromedial	section 	of	the	prefrontal	cortex	and	the
amygdala	 are	 especially	 high	 in	 concentrations	 of	 chemica l	 receptors	 for	 the
neurotransmitter	 serotonin.	 This	 brain	 chemical	 seems,	 amo ng	 other	 things,	 to	 prime
cooperation:	monkeys	with	extremely	high	density	of	recep tors	for	serotonin	in	the	pre-
frontal-amygdala	circuit	are	“socially	well-tuned,”	w hile	those	with	low	concentrations	are
hostile	 and	 antagonistic.	 See	 Antonio	 Damosio,	 Descartes’	 Error 	 (New	 York:
Grosset/Putnam,	1994).
13.	Animal	studies	show	that	when	areas	of	the	prefrontal	lob es	are	lesioned,	so	that	they	no
longer	 modulate	 emotional	 signals	 from	 the	 limbic	 area,	 the	 animals	 become	 erratic,
impulsively	 and	 unpredictably	 exploding	 in	 rage	 or	 c ringing	 in	 fear.	 A.	 R.	 Luria,	 the
brilliant	Russian	neuropsychologist,	proposed	as	lon g	ago	as	the	1930s	that	the	prefrontal
cortex	 was	 key	 for	 self-control	 and	 constraining	 emot ional	 outbursts;	 patients	 who	 had
damage	to	this	area,	he	noted,	were	impulsive	and	prone 	to	flareups	of	fear	and	anger.
And	a	study	of	two	dozen	men	and	women	who	had	been	conv icted	of	impulsive,	heat-of-
passion	murders	found,	using	PET	scans	for	brain	imagin g,	that	they	had	a	much	lower
than	usual	level	of	activity	in	these	same	sections	of	t he	prefrontal	cortex.

for	emotional	intelligence,	much	like	SAT	scores	are	for	 IQ.	Block	analyzed	data	from	a

of	high	IQ	independent	of	emotional	intelligence,	and	e motional	intelligence	apart	from

PART	THREE:	EMOTIONAL	INTELLIGENCE	APPLIED
Chapter	9.	Intimate	Enemies
			1.	There	are	many	ways	to	calculate	the	divorce	rate,	and 	the	statistical	means	used	will
determine	 the	 outcome.	 Some	 methods	 show	 the	 divorce	 rate	 p eaking	 at	 around	 50
percent	 and	 then	 dipping	 a	 bit.	 When	 divorces	 are	 cal culated	 by	 the	 total	 number	 in	 a
given	 year,	 the	 rate	 appears	 to	 have	 peaked	 in	 the	 198 0s.	 But	 the	 statistics	 I	 cite	 here
calculate	not	the	number	of	divorces	that	occur	in	a	g iven	year,	but	rather	the	odds	that	a
couple	marrying	in	a	given	year	will	eventually	have	 their	marriage	end	in	divorce.	That
statistic	 shows	 a	 climbing	 rate	 of	 divorce	 over	 the	 las t	 century.	 For	 more	 detail:	 John

of	 studies	 used	 “meta-analysis,”	 in	 which	 results	 from	 man y	 smaller	 studies	 can	 be

in	any	given	study	to	be	detected	more	easily	becaus e	of	the	much	larger	total	number	of

			7.	Skeptics	argue	that	the	emotional	picture	linked	to	hi gher	rates	of	disease	is	the	profile	of
the	quintessential	neurotic—an	anxious,	depressed,	an d	angry	emotional	wreck—and	that
the	 higher	 rates	 of	 disease	 they	 report	 are	 due	 not	 so	 mu ch	 to	 a	 medical	 fact	 as	 to	 a
propensity	to	whine	and	complain	about	health	problems,	 exaggerating	their	seriousness.
But	Friedman	and	others	argue	that	the	weight	of	evidence 	for	the	emotion-disease	link	is
borne	by	research	in	which	it	is	physicians’	evaluation s	of	observable	signs	of	illness	and
medical	 tests,	 not	 patients’	 complaints,	 that	 determine 	 the	 level	 of	 sickness—a	 more
objective	basis.	Of	course,	there	is	the	possibility	t hat	increased	distress	is	the	result	of	a
medical	 condition,	 as	 well	 as	 precipitating	 it;	 for	 t hat	 reason	 the	 most	 convincing	 data
come	from	prospective	studies	in	which	emotional	states	a re	evaluated	prior	to	the	onset
of	disease.

			9.	Of	the	dozen	or	so	studies	of	hostility	and	death	from	hea rt	disease,	some	have	failed	to
find	a	link.	But	that	failure	may	be	due	to	differences	i n	method,	such	as	using	a	poor
measure	of	hostility,	and	to	the	relative	subtlety	of	the 	effect.	For	instance,	the	greatest
number	of	deaths	from	the	hostility	effect	seem	to	occur	in	 midlife.	If	a	study	fails	to	track
down	the	causes	of	death	for	people	during	this	period,	 it	misses	the	effect.

21.	There	may	be	multiple	reasons	why	people	under	stress	a re	more	vulnerable	to	sickness,
apart	 from	 biological	 pathways.	 One	 might	 be	 that	 the	 ways 	 people	 try	 to	 soothe	 their
anxiety—for	example,	smoking,	drinking,	or	bingeing	on	 fatty	foods—are	in	themselves
unhealthy.	Still	another	is	that	constant	worry	and	anx iety	can	make	people	lose	sleep	or
forget	 to	 comply	 with	 medical	 regimens—such	 as	 taking	 medic ations—and	 so	 prolong
illnesses	 they	 already	 have.	 Most	 likely,	 all	 of	 these	 work	 in	 tandem	 to	 link	 stress	 and

Disorder,”	Archives	of	General	Psychiatry 	50	(April	1993),	294–305.
	 	 	 8. 	 Some	 of	 the	 evidence	 for	 trauma-induced	 changes	 in	 this	 b rain	 network	 comes	 from
experiments	in	which	Vietnam	vets	with	PTSD	were	injected 	with	yohimbine,	a	drug	used
on	 the	 tips	 of	 arrows	 by	 South	 American	 Indians	 to	 rend er	 their	 prey	 helpless.	 In	 tiny
doses	 yohimbine	 blocks	 the	 action	 of	 a	 specific	 receptor 	 (the	 point	 on	 a	 neuron	 that
receives	 a	 neurotransmitter)	 that	 ordinarily	 acts	 as	 a	 brake	 on	 the	 catecholamines.
Yohimbine	 takes	 the	 brakes	 off,	 keeping	 these	 receptors	 fr om	 sensing	 the	 secretion	 of
======================================== [Página 370] ========================================

catecholamines;	the	result	is	increasing	catecholamine	l evels.	With	the	neural	brakes	on
anxiety	disarmed	by	the	drug	injections,	the	yohimbine	t riggered	panic	in	9	of	15	PTSD
patients,	 and	 lifelike	 flashbacks	 in	 6.	 One	 vet	 had	 a	 hallucination	 of	 a	 helicopter	 being
shot	down	in	a	trail	of	smoke	and	a	bright	flash;	another	 saw	the	explosion	by	a	land	mine
of	 a	 Jeep	 with	 his	 buddies	 in	 it—the	 same	 scene	 that	 had	 hau nted	 his	 nightmares	 and
appeared	as	flashbacks	for	more	than	20	years.	The	yohimbin e	study	was	conducted	by
Dr.	 John	 Krystal,	 director	 of	 the	 Laboratory	 of	 Clinic al	 Psychopharmacology	 at	 the
National	Center	for	PTSD	at	the	West	Haven,	Conn.,	VA	 Hospital.
			9.	Fewer	alpha-2	receptors	in	men	with	PTSD:	see	Charney,	 “Psychobiologic	Mechanisms.”
10.	 The	 brain,	 trying	 to	 lower	 the	 rate	 of	 CRF	 secretion,	 compensates	 by	 decreasing	 the
number	of	receptors	that	release	it.	One	telltale	sign 	that	this	is	what	happens	in	people
with	PTSD	comes	from	a	study	in	which	eight	patients	being	 treated	for	the	problem	were
injected	with	CRF.	Ordinarily,	an	injection	of	CRF	tr iggers	a	flood	of	ACTH,	the	hormone
that	streams	through	the	body	to	trigger	catecholamines.	B ut	in	the	PTSD	patients,	unlike
a	comparison	group	of	people	without	PTSD,	there	was	no	 discernible	change	in	levels	of
ACTH—a	sign	that	their	brains	had	cut	back	on	CRF	recept ors	because	they	already	were
overloaded	 with	 the	 stress	 hormone.	 The	 research	 was	 descr ibed	 to	 me	 by	 Charles
Nemeroff,	a	Duke	University	psychiatrist.
11.	I	interviewed	Dr.	Nemeroff	in	 The	New	York	Times 	(June	12,	1990).
12.	Something	similar	seems	to	occur	in	PTSD:	For	instance, 	in	one	experiment	Vietnam	vets
with	a	PTSD	diagnosis	were	shown	a	specially	edited	15 -minute	film	of	graphic	combat
scenes	 from	 the	 movie	 Platoon .	 In	 one	 group,	 the	 vets	 were	 injected	 with	 naloxone, 	 a
substance	that	blocks	endorphins;	after	watching	the	movi e,	these	vets	showed	no	change
in	their	sensitivity	to	pain.	But	in	the	group	without 	the	endorphin	blocker,	the	men’s	pain
sensitivity	decreased	30	percent,	indicating	an	inc rease	in	endorphin	secretion.	The	same
scene	had	no	such	effect	on	veterans	who	did	not	have	PTS D,	suggesting	that	in	the	PTSD
victims	the	nerve	pathways	that	regulate	endorphins	were 	overly	sensitive	or	hyperactive
—an	 effect	 that	 became	 apparent	 only	 when	 they	 were	 reexp osed	 to	 something
reminiscent	 of	 the	 original	 trauma.	 In	 this	 sequence	 the	 amygdala	 first	 evaluates	 the
emotional	 importance	 of	 what	 we	 see.	 The	 study	 was	 done	 b y	 Dr.	 Roger	 Pitman,	 a
Harvard	 psychiatrist.	 As	 with	 other	 symptoms	 of	 PTSD,	 this 	 brain	 change	 is	 not	 only
learned	under	duress,	but	can	be	triggered	once	aga in	if	there	is	something	reminiscent	of
the	 original	 terrible	 event.	 For	 example,	 Pitman	 found	 that	 when	 laboratory	 rats	 were
shocked	 in	 a	 cage,	 they	 developed	 the	 same	 endorphin-bas ed	 analgesia	 found	 in	 the
Vietnam	vets	shown	 Platoon .	Weeks	later,	when	the	rats	were	put	into	the	cages	w here
they	 had	 been	 shocked—but	 without	 any	 current	 being	 turn ed	 on—they	 once	 again
became	insensitive	to	pain,	as	they	originally	had	bee n	when	shocked.	See	Roger	Pitman,
“Naloxone-Reversible	 Analgesic	 Response	 to	 Combat-Re lated	 Stimuli	 in	 Posttraumatic
Stress	 Disorder,”	 Archives	of	General	Medicine 	 (June	 1990).	 See	 also	 Hillel	 Glover,

“Psychobiologic	Mechanisms.”

15.	Role	of	prefrontal	cortex	in	unlearning	fear:	In	Richa rd	Davidson’s	study,	volunteers	had
their	sweat	response	measured	(a	barometer	of	anxiety)	 while	they	heard	a	tone	followed
by	a	loud,	obnoxious	noise.	The	loud	noise	triggered	 a	rise	in	sweat.	After	a	time,	the	tone
alone	was	enough	to	trigger	the	same	rise,	showing	that	 the	volunteers	had	learned	an
aversion	to	the	tone.	As	they	continued	to	hear	the	ton e	without	the	obnoxious	noise,	the
learned	aversion	faded	away—the	tone	sounded	without	an y	increase	in	sweat.	The	more
active	the	volunteers’	left	prefrontal	cortex,	the	more	 quickly	they	lost	the	learned	fear.
				In	another	experiment	showing	the	prefrontal	lobes’	 role	in	getting	over	a	fear,	lab	rats
—as	is	so	often	the	case	in	these	studies—learned	to	fear 	a	tone	paired	with	an	electric
shock.	The	rats	then	had	what	amounts	to	a	lobotomy,	a	surg ical	lesion	in	their	brain	that
cut	off	the	prefrontal	lobes	from	the	amygdala.	For	the	next 	several	days	the	rats	heard	the
tone	without	getting	an	electric	shock.	Slowly,	over	 a	period	of	days,	rats	who	have	once
learned	to	fear	a	tone	will	gradually	lose	their	fear. 	But	for	the	rats	with	the	disconnected
prefrontal	lobes,	it	took	nearly	twice	as	long	to	un learn	the	fear—suggesting	a	crucial	role
for	 the	 prefrontal	 lobes	 in	 managing	 fear	 and,	 more	 gener ally,	 in	 mastering	 emotional
lessons.	 This	 experiment	 was	 done	 by	 Maria	 Morgan,	 a	 g raduate	 student	 of	 Joseph
LeDoux’s	at	the	Center	for	Neural	Science,	New	York	U niversity.

director	of	the	Traumatic	Stress	Studies	Program	at	the	M t.	Sinai	School	of	Medicine	in

20.	Another	level	at	which	relearning	goes	on,	at	least	fo r	adults,	is	philosophical.	The	eternal
question	of	the	victim—“Why	me?”—needs	to	be	addressed.	Be ing	the	victim	of	trauma
shatters	 a	 person’s	 faith	 that	 the	 world	 is	 a	 place	 that	 can	 be	 trusted,	 and	 that	 what
happens	to	us	in	life	is	just—that	is,	that	we	can	have	c ontrol	over	our	destiny	by	living	a
righteous	 life.	 The	 answers	 to	 the	 victim’s	 conundrum,	 of	 c ourse,	 need	 not	 be
philosophical	 or	 religious;	 the	 task	 is	 to	 rebuild	 a	 s ystem	 of	 belief	 or	 faith	 that	 allows
living	once	again	as	though	the	world	and	the	people	in 	it	can	be	trusted.
======================================== [Página 372] ========================================

21.	That	the	original	fear	persists,	even	if	subdued,	has	b een	shown	in	studies	where	lab	rats
were	 conditioned	 to	 fear	 a	 sound,	 such	 as	 a	 bell,	 when 	 it	 was	 paired	 with	 an	 electric
shock.	Afterward,	when	they	heard	the	bell	they	reacted	wi th	fear,	even	though	no	shock
accompanied	it.	Gradually,	over	the	course	of	a	year	 (a	very	long	time	for	a	rat—about	a
third	of	its	life),	the	rats	lost	their	fearfulness	of	the	b ell.	But	the	fear	was	restored	in	full
force	when	the	sound	of	the	bell	was	once	again	paired	 with	a	shock.	The	fear	came	back
in	a	single	instant—but	took	months	and	months	to	subsid e.	The	parallel	in	humans,	of
course,	is	when	a	traumatic	fear	from	long	ago,	dormant	fo r	years,	floods	back	in	full	force
with	some	reminder	of	the	original	trauma.

			2.	The	statistics	on	teen	crime	rates	are	from	the	Uniform	Cr ime	Reports,	Crime	in	the	U.S.,
1991 ,	published	by	the	Department	of	Justice.
			3.	Violent	crimes	in	teenagers:	In	1990	the	juvenile	ar rest	rate	for	violent	crimes	climbed	to
430	per	100,000,	a	27	percent	jump	over	the	1980	rate .	Teen	arrest	rates	for	forcible	rape
rose	from	10.9	per	100,000	in	1965	to	21.9	per	100,00 0	in	1990.	Teen	murder	rates	more
than	quadrupled	from	1965	to	1990,	from	2.8	per	100,000	 to	12.1;	by	1990	three	of	four
teenage	 murders	 were	 with	 guns,	 a	 79	 percent	 increase 	 over	 the	 decade.	 Aggravated
assault	by	teenagers	jumped	by	64	percent	from	1980	t o	1990.¡	See,	e.g.,	Ruby	Takanashi,
“The	Opportunities	of	Adolescence,”	 American	Psychologist 	(Feb.	1993).
			4.	In	1950	the	suicide	rate	for	those	15	to	24	was	4.5	p er	100,000.	By	1989	it	was	three
times	higher,	13.3.	Suicide	rates	for	children	10	to	14	 almost	tripled	between	1968	and

among	 children	 10	 to	 14,	 and	 three	 times	 higher	 among	 those 	 15	 to	 19.	 By	 1990,	 20
percent	of	AIDS	patients	were	in	their	twenties,	many	 having	become	infected	during	their
teen	years.	Pressure	to	have	sex	early	is	getting	st ronger.	A	survey	in	the	1990s	found	that
more	than	a	third	of	younger	women	say	that	pressure	from	p eers	made	them	decide	to
